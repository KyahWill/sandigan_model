Court of Baguio, Br. IV, in 
Criminal Case No. 2472-R, convicting the accused/appellant of violation 
of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, otherwise known as the Dangerous 
Drugs Act, the decretal portion of which reads:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "WHEREFORE, the court finds the accused, Domingo Bagano y 
Sali-en, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged, and hereby
 imposes on him the penalty of life imprisonment, as well as a fine of 
Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00).  The ten (10) kilos of marijuana are
 ordered forfeited in favor of the government which shall be transmitted
 to the Dangerous Drugs Board, through NBI Sub-office Baguio, as 
custodian, for proper disposition.</p>
    <p> "SO ORDERED."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The facts, as presented by the Solicitor General, are as 
follows:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "On August 1, 1985, Atty. Lolito Utitco of the National 
Bureau 
of Investigation (NBI) in Baguio City and Steven F. Bostick, a special 
agent of the U.S. Air Force at Clark Air Base, arranged a "buy-bust" 
operation against appellant who was a suspected narcotics dealer.  The 
plan was for Bostick to pose as buyer.  A civilian informer named 
Clayton Emateo was to aid Bostick by introducing him to 
appellant.</p>
    <p> "At around 2:45 in the afternoon of the same day, Bostick 
and 
Emateo proceeded to the residence of the latter in Baguio City to meet 
appellant who was there waiting.  They were followed by an NBI 
surveillance team.  Upon reaching their destination, Emateo introduced 
appellant and an unnamed friend to Bostick.  Shortly thereafter, 
negotiations for the purchase of ten (10) kilos of marijuana began 
between Bostick and appellant, with Emateo acting as interpreter.  
Bostick and appellant finally agreed on P800.00 as the price per kilo of
 the marijuana.  The group then proceeded to appellant's house at 
Irisan, Benguet, where he kept the marijuana.  They were all the time 
being trailed by the NBI team.  At Irisan, appellant left Bostick and 
Emateo in the car.  He went back to them after about fifteen minutes, 
carrying a large white nylon sack (Exhibit "B").  Bostick opened the 
trunk of the car and appellant placed the sack inside.  Bostick opened 
the sack and saw several packages containing marijuana.  Bostick told 
appellant that he will pay for the marijuana after it has been weighed 
in his hotel.  Appellant agreed.  On the way back to his hotel in Baguio
 City, Bostick activated the beeper which signalled the NBI team 
following them that the transaction had taken place.  The NBI team then 
blocked Bostick's car and arrested appellant and Emateo."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Based on the foregoing, an information for violation of RA 
6425, 
as amended, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act, was filed 
against appellant alleging:</p><p align="center"> xxx       
            
              xxx                               xxx
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "That on or about the 1st day of August, 1985, in the City
 of 
Baguio, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, without any authority of law, did then 
and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attempt to sell to 
another ten (10) kilos, more or less, of dried marijuana leaves, a 
dangerous drug, for P800.00 per kilo, in violation of the afore-cited 
provision of law."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty.  His earlier
 
motion to admit bail was deferred and later denied.  Thereafter, trial 
on the merits ensued.  On August 9, 1986, the trial judge rendered the 
assailed decision (<em>Rollo</em>, pp. 19-36) sentencing 
appellant, 
among others, to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.  Hence, this 
appeal.
  </p><p> Appellant denies any knowledge anent the ownership
 and sale of
 marijuana to Bostick and in support thereof, he declared that:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "(H)e farms at Irisan, Baguio City; on August 1, 1985, at 
around
 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he went to the house of Clayton Emateo, 
located along Bonifacio St., to collect the amount of P4,000.00 which 
the latter borrowed from him on July 1, 1985; on this latter date 
Clayton went to him and pleaded for the loan, saying that he needed it 
to replace the money he took from his wife which he lost in gambling; 
Clayton was at his residence when he saw him on August 1, 1985; 
<em>Clayton
 told him to wait for his visitor from whom he would get the money to 
pay his debt</em>; the American visitor arrived, and he was 
introduced 
to him in English, as Steven; after the introduction,<em> they 
rode in 
the car of the American  and he was told by Clayton that they were 
proceeding to Irisan to get the bag which Clayton would give to the 
American as a gift; Clayton sent him to get the bag because he did not 
want to get wet; he went to get the bag and placed it in the car of the 
American; Clayton asked him to ride with them again;</em> while 
they 
were maneuvering the car towards Baguio, two cars stopped and one of the
 passengers (NBI agent) came out, brought out his gun and pointed it at 
him;" (Decision, p. 11; <em>Rollo,</em> p. 29; Underscoring 
supplied).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In this appeal appellant contends that the lower court 
erred:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "1.  IN FINDING THAT THE APPELLANT AGREED TO SELL TEN (10)
 KILOS
 OF MARIJUANA TO STEVEN BOSTICK WHEN IN FACT, THE APPELLANT HAS NO 
KNOWLEDGE OR DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ALLEGED MARIJUANA 
SALE;</p>
    <p> "2.  IN NOT HOLDING AS HEARSAY THE ALLEGED CONVERSATION 
BETWEEN 
BOSTICK AND APPELLANT WHEN IN FACT, CLAYTON EMATEO, THE CIVILIAN 
INFORMANT WHO INTERPRETED THEIR CONVERSATION WAS NEVER PRESENTED TO 
TESTIFY;</p>
    <p> "3.  IN APPRECIATING THE 'BAG' AND NOT SACK AGAINST 
APPELLANT 
THAT WHICH CLAYTON OWNED AND DEPOSITED IN THE QUARTER OF THE APPELLANT 
AT IRISAN THAT 10:00 A.M. OF AUGUST 1, 1985 WHEN IN FACT, EVEN BOSTICK 
LIKEWISE REFERRED TO THE SACK AS 'BAG' MANY TIMES IN HIS 
TESTIMONY;</p>
    <p> "4.  IN NOT APPRECIATING THE DEFENSE OF THE APPELLANT THAT
 IT 
WAS CLAYTON, THE CIVILIAN INFORMER, WHO OWNS THE MARIJUANA IN QUESTION."
 (Appellant's Brief, pp. 1-2; <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 
49-50)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> It is the contention of the prosecution that appellant was 
apprehended as a result of a "buy-bust" operation which was conducted on
 the strength of an information supplied by a certain Clayton Emateo.  
It is alleged that according to the informer, appellant would only sell 
to a foreigner, preferably an American.  Immediately, Atty. Utitco, the 
NBI Chief of Baguio City, sought assistance from the Clark Air Base 
which in turn sent Steven Bostick for the purpose.</p><p> 
The "buy-bust"
 operation involved Bostick and Emateo to proceed to the latter's 
residence and therein meet with the suspect for the purchase of 
marijuana.  Acting as the "poseur" buyer, Bostick testified that he was 
provided counterfeit money by the NBI which was combined with his own 
US$200.00 converted to pesos because appellant only accepts payment in 
local currency (TSN, November 7, 1985, p. 16).</p><p> Upon 
arrival at 
Emateo's residence, Bostick was introduced by Emateo to appellant and a 
certain Arman Perez.  As to how the "buy-bust" transaction was initiated
 may be gleaned from the following testimony of Bostick:

  </blockquote>
  <p>Evident from the foregoing is the fact that Bostick's 
testimonies 
as principal witness for the prosecution, are mere translations and/or 
interpretations of what the appellant supposedly said in the dialect to 
and interpreted by informant Emateo.  As such, they are pure 
hearsay.</p>
  <p> With the exception of that portion of Bostick's testimony 
that he 
saw the accused-appellant carry the sackful of marijuana, Bostick 
testified not on his personal knowledge regarding the alleged ownership 
thereof and the appellant's purported offer to sell the same.  Bostick 
never understood the Kankanai dialect spoken by appellant and Emateo and
 is therefore not qualified to testify against appellant in the 
imputation of the crime charged.  Thus, "where a witness is offered to 
testify to the statements of another person, spoken in a language not 
understood by him, but translated for him by an interpreter, such 
witness is not qualified, because he does not speak from personal 
knowledge.  All that he can know as to the testimony which is in fact 
given in such a case is from the interpretation thereof which is given 
by another person." (F. Wharton, Evidence in Criminal Cases 697-698 
[11th ed., 1935])</p><p> Indeed, a confession cannot be 
received in 
evidence by the testimony of a witness who, although present when it was
 made, learned its purport through an interpreter (<em>US v. Chu 
Chio</em>,
 8 Phil. 269 [1907]).
  </p><p> The impropriety of introducing the testimony of 
Bostick is 
plainly evident.  What the prosecution should have done was to present 
Emateo himself to testify on what actually transpired between appellant 
and Bostick and thereafter be cross-examined.  Yet, the court 
<em>a quo</em>
 chose to ignore appellant's constitutional right to meet the witnesses 
face to face (Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 14, [2]).  In an attempt to 
circumvent said right, prosecution witness Atty. Utitco reasoned:
  </p><blockquote>

keep in constant contact with this informer. He only comes to the office
 when there is work to do. As a matter of fact since this operation was 
accomplished, I have never seen him again. (TSN, December 4, 1985, p. 
10)</div></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody></table>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Atty. Utitco's revelation that he knew nothing of his 
supposed 
informant's background is rather disturbing.  Appellant's limb and 
liberty at stake, Utitco discarded all what a prudent and thinking man 
would have taken in order to establish the veracity of a story of one 
virtually unknown to him.  Appellant should have been, at the least, 
placed under surveillance (See <em>People v. Periodica, Jr., et 
al.</em>,
 G.R. No. 73006, September 29, 1989).</p>
  <p> The Court is not unaware of the policy behind non­disclosure
 of an
 informant's identity and would generally uphold the exercise of such 
privilege as the circumstances may warrant.  In the instant case, 
however, said privilege cannot be invoked given the factual setting that
 led to the incarceration of accused-appellant.  For one thing, the 
identity and even the address of the supposed informant are already 
known to appellant.  More, he was an active participant of the crime 
charged and is in fact the person whom appellant insists is the owner of
 the prohibited merchandise.  In point of fact, the informer (Emateo) 
was arrested together with appellant by the NBI team after the latter 
had blocked Bostick's car.  If indeed Emateo is an informer and not the 
owner of the prohibited drug, why was he arrested?  Nonetheless, 
whatever reason the prosecution may have had in shielding the informant 
vanished and ceased to exist by the time his identity was made public in
 the course of the trial by the prosecution witnesses 
themselves.</p><p>
 As pointed out by the appellant, the informant's failure to take the 
witness stand to confirm the correctness of his interpretations not only
 rendered the testimonies of Bostick as hearsay and therefore, 
inadmissible in evidence, but also deprived appellant of his right to 
cross-examine him (Appellant's Brief, pp. 11-12; 
<em>Rollo</em>, pp. 
59-60).
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "The right of cross-examination 'is a substantial right, 
the 
preservation of which is essential to a proper administration of 
justice, and extends to all matters within the knowledge of the witness,
 the disclosure of which is material to the controversy.'" 
(<em>Crosby 
v. State</em>, 82 S.E. 2d 38 [1954]; citing <em>News 
Publishing Co. v. 
Butler</em>, 22 S.E. 282 [1895]; <em>Richards v. 
Harpe,</em> 155 S.E. 85
 [1930])</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Emateo's testimony is not merely corroborative and 
cumulative and 
hence, maybe dispensed with (People v. Extra, 72 SCRA 199 [1976]; People
 v. Cerelegia, 147 SCRA 538 [1987]; <em>People v. 
Capulong</em>, 160 
SCRA 533 [1988];<em> People v. Asio,</em> G.R. No. 84960, 
September 
1,1989), but is direct and material to the defense of appellant who 
claims innocence of the offense imputed against him and is entitled to 
have the former take the witness stand (Appellant's Brief, pp. 11-12; 
<em>Rollo</em>,
 p. 60; TSN, November 8, 1985, p. 22), considering appellant's 
disclaimer of ownership of the prohibited drug.
  </p><p> In <em>People v. Rojo</em> (G. R. No. 
82737, July 5, 1989), 
the Court, in acquitting the accused-appellant, stamped a note of 
disapproval on the prosecution's refusal to present the supposed 
informant whose identity has already been known, to wit:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "Thus,<em> the identity of the informant was known 
to the 
appellant all the time </em>and when immediately thereafter the 
appellant was apprehended and arrested by the police officers and the 
informant was not similarly taken into custody, the only logical 
conclusion is that the appellant right then and there found out that he 
was the victim of an entrapment and that the informant was in collusion 
with the police authorities.</p>
    <p> "<em>There is, therefore, no reason why the 
prosecution could 
not and did not present the informant as a prosecution witness.  He is 
the best witness to establish the charge against the appellant who 
denies the charge</em>" (citing<em> Pp. v. Ale</em>, 
145 SCRA 50, [1986]
 where the accused was likewise acquitted).  (Italics 
supplied)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In an earlier case of <em>People v. Caboverde 
</em>(160 SCRA 550 
[1988]) where the prosecution refused to identify the informer, the 
Court stated:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "The witnesses for the prosecution refused to divulge the 
identity of said informer, who could have been a very vital 
corroborating witness to their testimonies and thus strengthen the 
position of the prosecution.  Prosecution maintained that to expose the 
identity and to bring this informer to court as witness would pose grave
 danger to the life of such informer.  What danger did the prosecution 
fear, <em>when the identity of said informer and his involvement 
in the 
entrapment of appellant was already made known to the appellant during 
the alleged exchange of the marijuana stuff and money</em>." 
(Italics 
supplied)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Non-presentation of an informer is a privilege that has its 
own 
inherent limitation — that of fairness in the administration of criminal
 justice.  Thus, where the disclosure of an informer's identity is 
relevant and helpful to the defense of the accused, or is essential to a
 proper disposition of the case, the privilege must give way 
(<em>Wilson
 v. United States</em>, 59 F. 2d 390 [1932].
  </p><p> Trial courts must always bear in mind that the 
right to meet 
the accuser and to have him examined is a fundamental right.  The 
constitution (Section 14 [2], Art. III) so mandates and they cannot do 
otherwise, especially so in instances where the party sought to be 
presented and examined possesses vital information essential to the  
defense in vindicating the accused's plea of innocence.  Such violation 
of appellant's fundamental right calls for the reversal of his 
conviction.  Thus:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "Where the disclosure of an informer's identity, or of the
 
contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of
 an accused, or is essential to a fair determination of a cause, the 
privilege must give way.  In these situations, the trial court may 
require disclosure and, if the Government withholds the information, 
dismiss the action (<em>Roviaro v. United States,</em> 353 
US 53, 1 L ed
 2d 639 [1957]).</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> In the case at bar, while the identity of the informer is 
disclosed, nevertheless, the prosecution failed to present him as a 
witness on the dubious assertion that his whereabouts are unknown.  As 
no subpoena appears to have been issued by the prosecution to the said 
informer, the presumption that evidence willfully suppressed would be 
adverse if produced (Section 5 [e], Rule 131) arises.</p><p>
 Emateo's 
non-production as a witness could have been excused had he merely played
 the part of a true informer.  An informer is one who communicates 
knowledge of someone having committed or about to commit a crime to the 
proper authorities who by themselves, acting independently, may obtain 
the evidence necessary for the prosecution of the offender.  On the 
contrary, he did more than that.  He played a substantial part in the 
act complained of and is in fact claimed by the appellant as the real 
owner of the subject marijuana.</p><p> The case of 
<em>Sorrentino v. 
U.S.</em> (163 F.2d 627 [1947]), provides the distinction between 
one 
who played the part of a mere informer and a decoy.  There, the 
defendant was charged for an illegal sale of opium in favor of a person,
 the identity of whom the US Government claims to be confidential.  
Objections as regards questions seeking to ascertain his identity were 
sustained by the trial court on the ground that it will violate the 
privilege of withholding the identity of informers.  In reversing the 
trial court, it was held that:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "If the person whom Grady called an informer had been an 
informer and nothing more, appellant would not have been entitled to 
have his identity disclosed; but the person whom Grady called an 
informer was something more.  He was the person to whom appellant was 
said to have sold and dispensed the opium described in the indictment.  
Information as to this person's identity was therefore material to 
appellant's defense x x x."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> The Solicitor General, however, contends that appellant's 
disclaimer of having no knowledge about the sale of marijuana is not 
worthy of credence.  According to him, the best proof is the fact that 
appellant delivered a sackful of marijuana to Bostick and that the sale 
by appellant of marijuana to Bostick is shown by evidence independent of
 Clayton Emateo's testimony.  (Appellee's Brief, p. 7; 
<em>Rollo</em>, 
p. 125).
  </p><p> We disagree.  Appellant's denial of the ownership 
of marijuana
 and his testimony that he took the sack the contents of which turned 
out to be marijuana from the place where Emateo previously deposited it 
because he was only requested by Emateo to do so (TSN, March 20, 1986, 
pp. 7-8; March 31, 1986, pp. 8 &amp; 14), was never contradicted by 
the 
prosecution.  Thus:

  <p>The prosecution witnesses' bare assertions, including that of
 
Bostick's, anent appellant's delivery of the sack/bag of marijuana 
cannot, by itself, indicate ownership nor even illegal possession as 
contemplated by law under the circumstances in the absence of any other 
evidence.</p>
  <p> Neither is there any reason for us to believe, as advanced 
by the 
Solicitor General, that appellant even acknowledged ownership of the 
seized marijuana by identifying them and affixing his signature on the 
back and on each and every parcel inside it (sic) (Appelle's Brief, p. 
8; <em>Rollo</em>, p. 126).  Appellant testified that he 
affixed his 
signature because he was asked and forced to do so (TSN, March 20, 1986,
 p. 11; March 31, 1986, pp. 18 &amp; 22).  Nowhere in the cited 
testimony of Atty. Aurellado relied upon by the prosecution (Appelle's 
Brief, p. 8; <em>Rollo</em>, p. 126; TSN, November 8, 1985, 
pp. 9-15) 
was there any indication that appellant did acknowledge ownership of the
 prohibited merchandise.
  </p><p> Appellant's signature appearing on the sack and 
individual 
bundles containing marijuana do not signify, much less evidence, guilt 
for they are mere procedural steps normally undertaken after effecting 
arrest  (<em>People v. Sario</em>l, G.R. No. 83809, June 22,
 1989).  
Furthermore, it appearing that appellant was not informed of his right 
to counsel at the time he affixed his signature, the same has been 
obtained in violation of his right as a person under custodial 
investigation for the commission of an offense and is therefore 
inadmissible (Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 12 [1], [3]).
  </p><p> And there is the question of money involved.  
While the 
prosecution took time to prepare counterfeit money to the extent that 
Bostick even shelled out his own, the same turned out to be not really 
necessary it appearing that appellant never even got hold of it, much 
less saw the same.  It defies credulity that in a carefully orchestrated
 "buy-bust" operation such as in the case at bar, no money changed hands
 between the alleged buyer and seller.  It may then be asked, was there 
really an attempt to sell on the part of appellant of a merchandise he 
does not even own?
  </p><p> It is a cardinal rule in this jurisdiction that in
 order to 
merit conviction, the prosecution must rely on the strength of its own 
evidence and not on the weakness of evidence presented by the defense.  
An accused must always be deemed innocent until the contrary is proved 
beyond reasonable doubt.  In the instant case, the prosecution failed to
 so establish the guilt of herein appellant.</p><p>
