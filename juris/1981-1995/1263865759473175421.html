12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the former Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals) which upheld
the order dated July 19, 1984 of respondent Judge Ester N. Bans, the presiding
judge of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City,
Branch LXXII (72) in Civil Case No. 2325-0 issued in case for recovery of
ownership and possession with damages lodged by the herein petitioners as
plaintiffs against the herein private respondents, as defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as found by the respondent appellate court
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In Civil Case No. 2525, the Court of First Instance, in a
decision rendered on December 8, 1982, ordered the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span>
(the private respondents herein) to return the possession of the land in
question to the petitioners, the heirs of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Gorromeo</span>,
and to pay damages to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span> filed a notice of appeal, and subsequently an
appeal bond and record on appeal, but the Regional Trial Court (which in the
meanwhile had replaced the CFI) dismissed the appeal on the ground that the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span> had received a copy of the decision on January 12,
1983 but filed their notice of appeal only on February 1, after more than 15
days as required by section 39 of the new BP 129.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, on motion of the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span>,
the trial court on July 29, 1983 reconsidered its order, ordered the status quo
"prior to the issuance of the writ of execution on May 12, 1983" to
be restored, and approved the record on appeal of the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court made its order on the basis of
its finding that the decision of December 8. 1982 had been served on Flora
Rodolfo Guzman and Jaime Rodolfo personally when it should have been served
instead on their counsel as required by Rule 13, section 12.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court reiterated its ruling in its
order of February 28, 1984, denying the motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">Gorromeos</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The <span class="SpellE">Gorromeos</span> then gave notice that they
were in turn appealing the orders dated July 29, 1983 and February 28,
1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1984</st1:date>, however, the trial court, acting on motion
of the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span>, directed the respondent sheriff
"to restore possession of the land in question to the defendants the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span> pursuant to the Orders of this Court (IAC) dated <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1983</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1964</st1:date>." Hence this
petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Originally filed with the
Supreme Court, it was later referred to this Court for appropriate
determination.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the petitioners before the then Intermediate
Appellate Court was that as a consequence of their having filed, on March 5,
1984,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
their notice of appeal from the trial court's orders dated July 29, 1963 and
February 28, 1984, the trial court had already lost jurisdiction over Civil
Case No. 2525-0 and acted without authority in issuing the order dated July 19,
1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners prayed therefore
the respondent appellate court to invalidate the trial court's order of July
19, 1984 and to order the elevation of the records of Civil Case No. 2525-0.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent appellate court found no merit in the petitioners'
contentions and thus dismissed their petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Undaunted by the setback, the Petitioners are now before us with
basically the same issue and arguments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is not meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The perfection of appeal is explicitly covered by Section 23 of
the Interim Rules of Court which states, to wit.:</p>

<blockquote>23.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perfection of appeal. -
In cases where appeal is taken, the perfection of the appeal shall be upon the
expiration of the last day to appeal by any party.</blockquote>

<blockquote>B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in cases where a record
on appeal is required the appeal is perfected upon approval thereof by the
Court which should be done within ten (10) days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in cases where a record on appeal is not required, the mere
filing of a notice of appeal does not perfect the appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>xxx The mere fact that one party has already
filed his notice of appeal does not mean that the appeal has already been
perfected because the adverse party still has the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period within which to perfect his appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>.</p>

<blockquote>"[A]s long as any or the parties may still file his, her or
its appeal the court does not lose jurisdiction over the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>xxx it is only after all the parties'
respective periods to appeal have lapsed that the court loses its jurisdiction
over the case."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Here, it is clear that at the time the private respondents filed
their motion to be restored to the possession of the contested property on
March 13, 1984, the period within which they could appeal had not yet lapsed,
hence, the petitionersâ€™ appeal had not yet been perfected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As succinctly discussed by the Court of
Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span> received
a copy of the order of February 28, 1984 on March 13, 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same day they filed their motion to be
restored to the possession of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their motion was thus filed before the expiration of their period of
appeal had they desired appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, it appears that the <span class="SpellE">Gorromeos</span> received
the order of July 29, 1983 on August 17, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On August 24, they filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On March 5, 1984 they received a copy of the
order of February 28, 1984, denying their motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, deducting the period during which
their motion for reconsideration was pending, the <span class="SpellE">Gorromeos</span>
had until March 13, 1984 within which to appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, whether it is the period of appeal
of the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span> or that of the <span class="SpellE">Gorromeos</span>
that is considered, the motion to be restored to possession, which the <span class="SpellE">Rodolfos</span> filed on March 13, 1984, was filed before the
expiration of the appeal period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, there is no merit in the contention of the petitioners
that their appeal had been perfected and that the trial court no longer had
jurisdiction to issue its order of July 19, 1984.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the respondent appellate court and the
petitioners are supported by substantial evidence and the law; we therefore
find no reason to disturb them.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it is to be noted that originally, or at the time
the petitioners filed their complaint for recovery of ownership and possession
with damages against the private respondents, it was the latter who were in
possession of the property in dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>it was only later when due to the trial court's erroneous belief that
its decision has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for
failure of the private respondents to timely appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
that the petitioners by virtue of a writ of execution dated <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1983</st1:date>, were placed in
possession of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it turned
out, however, the trial court's decision was not properly served on the private
respondents and thus the same had not yet become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the trial court's decision was not yet final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and there was failure to comply with the
requirements contained in Section 2, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
on execution pending appeal, the writ of execution dated <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1983</st1:date> is thus manifestly invalid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, there is equally no valid reason nor
ground for the petitioners to keep possession of the contested property pending
the final termination or the controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court and the respondent appellate court acted correctly then
in ordering that the private respondents be restored to the possession of the
parcel of land in question.</p>
