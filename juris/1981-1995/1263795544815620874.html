<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioners (plaintiff therein filed with the Court of First 
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="24" month="5"><span>May 24, 1973</span></st1:date><span> Civil 
Case No. 925 entitled "<span class="SpellE"><em>Hulganza</em></span><em>, et al. 
v. Gemarino</em>", to:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) recover from private respondent 
(defendant therein) the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> representing 
the unpaid balance of </span><st1:place><span>Lot</span></st1:place><span>. No. 
161, Pls. 256; (2) compel private respondent to allow petitioners to redeem said 
parcel of land under Sec. 119 of Commonwealth Act 141 (Public Land Act); and (3) 
compel respondent to pay actual damages in the amount of 
P2,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Private respondent, in her answer, denied that said balance 
is due from her and countered that the period of legal redemption had already 
lapsed.<span>&nbsp; </span>She added that the instant action was filed as a business 
speculation, intended merely to harass her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The factual background of this case as admitted by both 
parties at the pre-trial conducted on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="24" month="5"><span>May 24, 1973</span></st1:date><span>, is as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 161, Pls. 256, the subject matter of 
the present case, is situated in Barrio Mina-<span class="SpellE">otoc</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Calatrava</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Negros</span></span> Occidental and is registered in the name of 
spouses <span class="SpellE">Nicomedez</span> <span class="SpellE">Hulganza</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Collamar</span> covered 
by Original Certificate of Title No. P-1672 issued pursuant to a free 
patent.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before <span class="SpellE">Nicomedez</span> <span class="SpellE">Hulganza</span> died leaving as his heirs herein petitioners, 
namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>his wife, <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> <span class="SpellE">Collamar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Hulganza</span>, Joel <span class="SpellE">Hulganza</span>, and 
Isidro <span class="SpellE">Hulganza</span>, he and his wife <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> had sold the said property on April 21, 1971 in 
favor of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gemarino</span> in the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and by virtue of the sale the original title was 
cancelled and a new one issued (T-5082) in the name of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gemarino</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Since that date, up to the present private respondent has been in 
possession of the property peacefully, openly or publicly, adversely and without 
interruption in the concept of owner.</p>
<p class="BODY">But on April 13, 1972, petitioners filed a complaint in court 
seeking to repurchase the property from said respondent under the provision of 
Section 119 of Public Land Act 141 as amended.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, pp. 25-26, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span> p. 87).</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>After pre-trial, the plaintiffs (herein petitioners) 
narrowed down their stand by withdrawing their other causes of action but 
asserted their rights under their second cause of action, maintaining that they 
have the right of legal redemption of the property under Sec. 119 of Act 141 
(Public Land Act).<span>&nbsp; </span>In their memorandum, they agreed not only to 
support the foregoing position but also on the fact that they are not obligated 
to pay for the improvements introduced by the vendee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand defendant (herein private respondent) also 
narrowed down her stand by reiterating the grounds alleged as special defenses 
in her answer, such <span>as:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) that the second cause of action 
does not state a </span>cause of action; (2) that the period of redemption had 
already lapsed and (3) that should the Court hold that the right of redemption 
still exists, she should be paid the cost of improvements introduced on the 
land, estimated to be valued at P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>However, she prays that the first ground be treated as a motion to 
dismiss.<span>&nbsp; </span>Private respondent concentrated her memorandum only on 
the first ground.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>ibid</em> pp. 
28-29).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The trial court in its Order dated February 1, 1974 denied the 
above-mentioned first ground which was considered as a motion to dismiss.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<em>ibid</em> p. 32).</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In its decision dated February 25, 1975, the same court 
rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs (herein petitioners) declaring that 
they have the legal right to exercise the right of redemption and ordering among 
other things, the defendant (herein private respondent) </span>to allow the 
former to exercise said right at the original purchase price of P10,000.00 with 
interest.</p>
<p class="BODY">As above-stated, on appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the 
decision of the lower court.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span>Hence, this 
petition.</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the resolution of July 6, 1981 of the Second Division of 
this Court, respondent was required to comment (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, </span><span>p. 89).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thereafter, counsel for private respondent having failed to file comment 
within the required period was required in the resolution of March 3, 1982 to 
explain such failure and to file the required comment, both of which were 
complied with on May 4, 1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 91) 
and on May 20, 1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 94), 
respectively.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners were required to file Reply to aforesaid 
comment in the resolution of June 14, 1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 99) which was complied with on August 16, 
1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 100).<span>&nbsp; </span>The Court 
gave due course to the petition in the resolution of September 1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 104).<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners filed 
their brief on January 3, 1983 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
110) while private respondent filed her brief on December 1, 1983 and the case 
was considered submitted for deliberation on June 20, 1984 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 143).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>There is merit in this petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The only issue raised herein, is whether or not it is 
necessary that the formal offer to redeem the land in question be accompanied by 
a </span><em>bona fide</em> <span>tender of the redemption price, or the 
repurchase price be consigned in Court, within the period of redemption even if 
the right is exercised through the filing of a judicial action (Brief for 
Petitioners; p. 5; </span><span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span><span> p. 
110).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Respondent Court of Appeals made the following 
findings:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"In the instant case it bears repeating that plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> failed to consign the amount due at the time they 
filed the complaint, four days before the lapse of the five-year period, and in 
fact it was only on the date of the trial more than three years later that the 
lower court was informed of the alleged existence of the money available in the 
hands of Isidro <span class="SpellE">Hulganza</span> who was then in 
Mindanao.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"This court is, therefore, of the belief that the act of merely 
filing the complaint on the part of the plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> without consignation of the proper amount due 
within the period prescribed was an ineffective and incomplete redemption and to 
say otherwise would in effect extend the period of redemption beyond that 
provided by law."</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span>(Brief for Petitioners, p. 3, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
110).</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>This issue has already been laid to rest in successive 
decisions of the Supreme Court which ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"The formal offer to redeem, accompanied by a <em>bona fide</em> 
tender of the redemption price, <span>within </span>the period of redemption 
prescribed by law, is only essential to preserve the right of redemp<span>tion 
for future enforcement beyond such period of redemption and within the period 
prescribed for the action by the sta</span>tute of limitations.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Where, as in the <span>instant case, the right to redeem is exercised 
thru the filing of judicial action </span>within <span>the period of redemption 
prescribed by the law, the formal offer to redeem, accompanied by a <em>bona 
fide</em> tender of the redemption price, might be</span> <span>proper, but it 
is not essential.<span>&nbsp; </span>The filing of the action itself, within the 
period of redemption, is equivalent to a formal offer to redeem.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Any other construction, particularly with reference to redemption of 
homesteads conveyed to third parties, would work hardships on the poor 
homesteaders who cannot be expected to know the subtleties of the law, and would 
defeat the evident purpose of the Public Land Law — 'to give the homesteader or 
patentee every chance to preserve for hims</span><span>elf and his family the 
land that the state granted him as a reward for his labor in cleaning and 
cultivating it.' (<span class="SpellE"><em>Avendaño</em></span><em> vs. Hao Su 
Ton</em>, 47 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., 357; <span class="SpellE"><em>Pascua</em></span><em> vs. Talens</em>, 45 Off.</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>., Supp. No. 9, 413.)" <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><em>Reveros</em></span></span><span class="GramE"><em> v. 
Abel</em><span>, et al., 48 Off.</span></span></span> <span class="SpellE"><span>Gaz</span></span><span>., </span>5318-5319 [1952]; 
<span>recently reiterated in <span class="SpellE"><em>Tolentino</em></span><em> v. 
Court of Appeals</em>, 106 SCRA 526 </span>[1981]).</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>In view of the foregoing consideration, it appears evident 
that the <em>bona</em> <em>fide</em> tender of the redemption price or its 
equivalent <span>—</span> consignation of said price in court is not essential 
or necessary in the case at bar where the filing of the action itself is 
equivalent to a formal offer to redeem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
