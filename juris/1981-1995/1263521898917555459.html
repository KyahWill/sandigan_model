Floriano T. Buynay, Domingo L. Chaves, Arturo C. Netuda, Reynaldo 
Arellano, Leopoldo Porlas, Alfonso Rama, Mansueto Cabale, Crisanto 
Velez, Florencio Tadlas, Jesus Medina and Rodrigo D. Sacala were charged
 with the crimes of Direct Assault with Frustrated Murder in Criminal 
Case No. CCC-XV-543 and with Direct Assault with Murder in Criminal Case
 No. CCC-XV-591 before the then Circuit Criminal Court of Misamis 
Oriental.
<p>
In Criminal Case No. CCC-XV-543, Reynaldo Arellano, Floriano T. Buynay 
and Domingo Chaves pleaded guilty to the charge and were sentenced 
accordingly, while Rodrigo Sacala, Leopoldo Porlas, Alfonso Rama and 
Arturo Netuda pleaded not guilty.  Jesus Medina, Mansueto Cabale and 
Crisanto Velez have remained at large.  After his arraignment, Alfonso 
Rama escaped and was tried in absentia.
</p><p>
In Criminal Case No. CCC-XV-591, Floriano Buynay, Domingo Chaves and 
Reynaldo Arellano pleaded guilty on arraignment, while Rodrigo Sacala, 
Leopoldo Porlas, Arturo Netuda and Alfonso Rama pleaded not guilty.  
Alfonso Rama was tried in absentia.  Jesus Medina, Crisanto Velez and 
Mansueto Cabale are still at large.  Notwithstanding the plea of guilty 
interposed by Buynay, Chaves and Arellano in this capital offense, the 
lower court proceeded to receive evidence to determine the degree of 
their culpability.
</p><p>
A joint trial of the two cases was held and, after hearing, the lower 
court rendered judgment finding Floriano Buynay, Domingo Chaves and 
Reynaldo Arellano guilty as principals of the crime of Direct Assault 
with Murder in CCC-XV-591 and sentencing each of them to suffer the 
penalty of death, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of 
Patrolman Romeo Tangara the sum of P12,000.00 and to pay 1/3 each of the
 costs.  Thus, this appeal concerns only Floriano Buynay, Domingo Chaves
 and Reynaldo Arellano.
</p><p>
On reasonable doubt, Rodrigo Sacala, Alfonso Rama, Leopoldo Porlas and Arturo Netuda were acquitted of the crimes charged.
</p><p>
Prosecution evidence shows that early morning of October 21, 1973 
prisoners Floriano Buynay, Domingo Chaves, Reynaldo Arellano and other 
prisoners of the City Jail of Cagayan de Oro City conceived the plan to 
escape.  They were able to cut or chisel their leg irons with a file or 
saw.  About 5:30 in the afternoon of the same day, when the door of the 
jail was opened to bring back to the cells the plywood bedding or 
"tarimas" which were taken out to the yards for airing, appellants 
Buynay, Chaves and Arellano and other prisoners rushed out of their 
cells.  Buynay, effectively, as planned, immediately approached and 
stabbed the guard on duty, Patrolman Romeo Tangara, on the right chest 
near the armpit with a stainless steel knife, while Chaves and Arellano 
together with prisoners Tadlas and Velez, stabbed Patrolman Gregorio 
Recla who was also on duty as corporal of the guard, at the back left 
armpit and on the head.
</p><p>
Patrolman Tangara died of shock due to hemorrhage resulting from stab 
wounds inflicted on him by Buynay.  Pfc. Recla survived the injuries he 
suffered because of medical attendance given him.
</p><p>
Chaves, Arellano and Buynay succeeded in escaping from the city jail 
that afternoon.  However, they were captured the following day in a 
river near Burgos Street.  Buynay and Chaves were investigated and both,
 after they were apprised of their rights to remain silent and to have 
counsel, gave their statements (Exhibits "B" and "A") which were signed 
and sworn to before Fiscal Noli ­Catli and Deputy Clerk of Court Aurelio
 Zaldivar, respectively.
</p><p>
Appellant Reynaldo Arellano testified that he was a detained prisoner in
 Cagayan de Oro City when in the afternoon of October 21, 1973 there was
 disorder and confusion among the prisoners in the city jail.  He left 
his cell and immediately a shot rang out and he was hit on the stomach 
and on the left leg.  He stood up and seeing the other prisoners jumping
 out the fence, he followed them and escaped.  They did not plan to kill
 the guards.
</p><p>
He admitted that he was an escapee from the Davao Penal Colony while 
serving sentence of from 8 to 14 years imposed by the then Court of 
First Instance of Pasay for the crime of robbery.  He was captured and 
detained in the city jail of Cagayan de Oro.
</p><p>
Appellant Floriano Buynay declared that when the beds were brought 
inside the cells, the other prisoners rushed out.  When Arellano and he 
went out also, Patrolman Tangara fired at and hit Arellano who fell to 
the ground.  He approached Patrolman Tangara and tried to take the 
policeman's pistol but failed because he was bumped by the other 
prisoners who were rushing out.  He was captured about 6:00 in the 
morning of the following day, October 22, 1973.
</p><p>
He claimed to have been maltreated, boxed and mauled by Patrolman 
Macalla and otter policemen.  He was not apprised of his constitutional 
rights when his affidavit, Exhibit "B", was taken but he signed it 
before the fiscal because he was afraid.  Their plan was to escape but 
not to kill anyone.
</p><p>
Appellant Domingo Chaves did not take the witness stand.
</p><p>
Defense counsel, Atty. Luis R. Feria, in his brief admits that the 
evidence adduced by the prosecution "both direct and circumstancial, 
clearly establishes the existence of a conspiracy among the appellants. 
 The extrajudicial confessions of appellants Chaves (Exhibit "A") and 
Buynay (Exhibit "B"), as well as the testimonies of prosecution 
witnesses Agustin Flores and Patrolman Recla depicting the conduct of 
the appellants and their concerted and coordinated action in the 
commission of the crime clearly show the presence of conspiracy in its 
commission (People vs. Pedro, 16 SCRA 57; People vs. Verzo, 21 SCRA 
1403; People vs. Cabiltes, 25 SCRA 112, and many others).  And 
undoubtedly, these extra­judicial confessions, Exhibits "A" and "B", are
 admissible against the other co-conspirators not only because 
conspiracy here has been proven by independent evidence other than the 
confession (People vs. Chaw Yaw Shun, 23 SCRA 127) but also because it 
is clear from the facts and circumstances that persons other than the 
declarant perpetrated the crime charged (People vs. Sta. Maria, 15 SCRA 
222) (Appellants' Brief, pp. 6-7)
</p><p>
However, appellants submit that the lower court erred in convicting them
 of the complex crime of direct assault with murder because the killing 
of the deceased Tangara is not murder, qualified by treachery, but only 
simple homicide.
</p><p>
The contention is without merit.  Prosecution evidence is clear that 
after appellants rushed out of their cells, Buynay held the hand of 
Patrolman Tangara who was then watching a game of "dama", and inquired 
if he was the guard on duty.  Without waiting for an answer, Buynay 
immediately stabbed Tangara.  The suddenness of the assault on the 
unsuspecting victim made it impossible for him to parry and avoid the 
stab blows.  The mode of attack adopted by the appellants insured the 
accomplishment of their purpose without risk to themselves arising from 
the defense which the person attacked might make.  (People vs. Curiano, 9
 SCRA 323)
</p><p>
Likewise, there is no merit in appellants' claim that there was no 
evident premeditation which attended the commission of the crime.  The 
plan to escape and attack the guards was hatched in the early morning of
 October 21, 1973.  The first thing they did was to chisel their leg 
irons with a file.  In the afternoon of the same day, as planned, they 
waited for the plywood beds to be brought in and, immediately, they 
rushed out and attacked their guards, an act manifestly indicating that 
they did cling to their determination.  Between the planning and the 
execution there was sufficient lapse of time to reflect and meditate 
upon the consequences of their act.  In fact, they were so prepared that
 they were armed with deadly weapons for the purpose of assaulting 
whoever were the guards on duty.  It is therefore hard to believe that 
the plan was only to escape.  What is credible is:  they would escape 
and attack whoever would be on the way.
</p><p>
As admitted by defense counsel in his brief, page 11, appellants Buynay 
and Arellano are quasi-recidivists.  Under Article 160 of the Revised 
Penal Code, quasi-recidivism is a special aggravating circumstance and 
the offender shall be punished with the maximum period of the penalty 
prescribed by law for the new felony.  It cannot be off-set by the 
ordinary mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty.
</p><p>
Domingo Chaves escaped from the New Bilibid Prison, Muntinlupa on 
October 8, 1981 and has remained at-large up to this date.  Being a 
death convict, his escape will not automatically result in the dismissal
 of this appeal.
</p><p>
The trial court did not err in imposing upon appellants the death 
penalty.  However, for lack of necessary votes the penalty is reduced to
 <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua</span>.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, as modified in the sense that the penalty is <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion 
perpetua</span> for each of the appellants, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED 
in all other respects.  With costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<em>Fernando</em>, C.J. and <em>Teehankee</em>, J., on leave (abroad).
