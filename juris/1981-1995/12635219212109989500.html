Appeal from the judgment of the then Court of First Instance of Baguio 
and Benguet, Second Judicial District, Branch IV, by Eduardo Teaño y 
Rimando who was found guilty of the crime of Robbery with Rape and 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to indemnify 
Francisco Prats in the amount of P3,906.00 for the articles he lost and 
Mary Alabat in the sum of P960.00 for the money and watch she lost and 
P5,000.00 by way of moral damages, without subsidiary imprisonment in 
case of insolvency.
<p>
Prosecution evidence shows that complainant Mary Alabat was asleep in 
the bedroom of the house of the Prats couple located at No. 57 Bokawkan 
Road, Baguio City when at about two o'clock in the morning of April 11, 
1976 she was awakened by a man wearing a sweater and a bonnet who 
entered her room.  With her at the time was Joey, the seven year old son
 of Mr. and Mrs. Prats.  Complainant asked the man who he was but the 
latter did not answer and instead, rushed at her and said:  "Huwag kang 
maingay.  Nasaan ang Mama na naghabol ng kapatid ko?" She answered that 
she did not know what he was talking about.  The man told her that 
sometime in 1968 an American who lived in said house chased his brother 
who, as a consequence, became lame.  She replied that they were new in 
the place.  All the while, the man was holding a flashlight with his 
left hand and, thereafter, proceeded to search the room, closet and 
bathroom, and found that there was no other person aside from 
complainant and Joey.  He then approached the complainant, focused his 
flashlight at her face and, pointing the knife at her, said:  "Huwag 
kang maingay.  Pagbigyan mo ako ngayon." She cried and trembled with 
fear as she saw the man take off his pants.  She tried to get up from 
the bed but the man grabbed her blanket, folded her arms across her 
breast as he pointed a knife at the left side of her neck.  Thereupon, 
he placed himself on top of her and warned her not to move or shout 
otherwise, he would kill her and the boy who was then sleeping in 
another bed.  Afraid, she did not move or shout.  He then lifted her 
skirt, removed her pantie and had carnal knowledge with her, after he 
had placed the flashlight on a small cabinet near the bed.
</p><p>
After appellant was through with his sexual act, he went to the closet 
and took from complainant's bag, a watch valued at P650.00 and cash 
amounting to P310.00.  Before leaving the room, he warned her not to 
report the matter to anyone.
</p><p>
After the man had left the room, complainant hid Joey to the adjoining 
bathroom.  Then she woke up the maids who were in the next room and told
 them about the intruder.  Then they all hid themselves in the bathroom.
  Towards dawn they went to the room of Mr. and Mrs. Francisco Prats and
 with tears in her eyes, complainant, narrated to them what had happened
 to her.  Mr. Prats called the police and when they arrived they went 
around the house and found that the intruder used a long ladder in 
entering the window at the second floor and removed seven pieces of the 
glass jalousies therein.  The bag of complainant Mary Alabat was found 
at the living room, without the money and the watch.  Also found missing
 in the house were (1) one TV set valued at P3,000.00; (2) three bottles
 of Fundador worth P225.00; (3) four bottles of Marques del Rescal worth
 P292.00; (4) three bottles of Diamante wine worth P189.00; and (5) two 
floor pillows worth P100.00, all belonging to the Prats couple.  The 
policemen lifted fingerprints from the ladder and from the different 
places in the house.  In the afternoon, they interrogated Mary Alabat 
and, the following day, she gave a written statement.  In the morning of
 April 13, 1976, the police invited Eduardo Teaño and his brother 
Alberto to the police station for investigation.  Eduardo was sporting a
 long hair and a mustache, while his brother Alberto was observed to be 
limping when he walks.  They called upon Mary Alabat who identified 
Eduardo as the one who sexually abused her in the morning of April 11, 
1976.
</p><p>
On April 14, 1976, complainant was physically examined by Dr. Arturo G. 
Luczon, who, thereafter, issued the following medico-legal report, 
marked as Exhibit "C"
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Victim claims that the person in question allegedly entered 
victim's room and threatened to kill her and the child sleeping in the 
same room with the victim if she should not consent to his demands.  The
 act was allegedly consummated once. </p>

  </p>

<p>
Defense evidence is alibi.  On the night April 10, 1976 until the 
following morning of April 11, he was at home sleeping, together with 
the family of his elder brother Alberto, his mother Felicidad, and his 
younger brother Joseph.  The bed where he slept was only about a foot 
away from that of his mother who was a light-sleeper and could have 
noticed if he had left the house that evening.
</p><p>
The defense also presented Jose P. Abaya, Jr., who, at the time, was a 
Patrolman of Baguio Police Department.  When he was assigned to 
investigate the case, he promptly proceeded to the Prats' residence to 
question the complain­ant, Mary Alabat.  In the presence of Cpl. 
Alejandre Layagan, complainant told them that she might not identify the
 offender even if presented to her again because at the time of the 
incident the man was focusing the flashlight directly at her face.
</p><p>
The other witness presented by the defense was Rosalina Veloso, a maid 
in the Prats' household.  She testified that she was able to recognize 
the intruder but denied that it was herein appellant.
</p><p>
The question before the Court hinges on whether or not appellant Eduardo
 Teaño y Rimando has been sufficiently identified as the perpetrator of 
the crime charged.
</p><p>
The defense argued that with respect to the charge of robbery, the 
prosecution failed to present any evidence, direct or circumstancial, to
 link herein appellant.  There were several items which were allegedly 
lost, namely:  One (1) 19-inch television set and eleven (11) bottles of
 liquor and wines, but not one single item was found in the possession 
of Teaño.  The ladder allegedly used in entering through the window of 
the Prats residence and which was left at the scene of the crime was 
presented as evidence but the police failed to trace its ownership to 
appellant.  The culprit was without gloves and handled various objects 
in the Prats' residence like complainant's bag, door knob, closet and 
other objects and from which as many as 36 fingerprints were lifted.  
Not one matched any of the specimen prints of the ten (10) fingers of 
herein accused.  Hereunder is the testimony of Arturo Marasigan, 
Fingerprint Examiner, Philippine Constabulary Crime Laboratory, relative
 to his examination of the lifted latent prints (Exhibits "Q-1" to 
"Q-36") and the standard fingerprints of appellant Eduardo Teaño:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q    The purpose of this examination is to find out whether there
 are fingerprints from the standard fingerprint charts which are the 
same or similar with any of the fingerprints in the latent and developed
 prints, is that correct? </p>
  <p>
    A    Yes, to establish identity or non-identity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Did you find any similarity or the same fingerprints?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    No, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Will you tell us why you did not or you were not able to find 
any similar characteristics between the standard fingerprint charts and 
the latent and developed fingerprints lifted from the scene of the 
crime?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    May I see my record.  Because, I was not able to establish the 
coinciding base characteristics of both prints, questioned and standard 
prints.  There are no coinciding on the latent with the standard 
fingerprints.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   From Q-1, Q-5, Q-13, Q-14, Q-17, Q-20, Q-31, Q-32, Q-33 and Q-35?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   What is the reason for this?
  </p>
  <p> A    Well, because it does not tally with the characteristics 
appearing in the standard.  The characteristics appear­ing in the latent
 prints were not identical with the standard finger­prints. </p>
  <p>
    FISCAL BALAJADIA:
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Would you say that the questioned prints which I have already 
enumerated are clear enough to be compared with the standard 
fingerprints?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Yes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   However, questioned fingerprints Q-2, Q-3, Q-4, Q-6 and Q-12, 
inclusive; Q-15, Q-16, Q-21, to Q-30, inclusive; Q-34 to Q-36 are 
blurred and their impressions are fragmentary?
  </p>
  <p> A    Yes." (pp. 15-16, June 20, 1978 hearing) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With respect to the charge of rape, the defense claims that the 
prosecution relied completely on the identification of the appellant by 
Mary Alabat.  The defense considered her identification as incredible 
because -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  Mary Alabat identified appellant only after he was made to put
 on the sweater (Exhibit "M") which however did not belong to him 
because his sweater was a cardigan which opens in front down to the 
waist, unlike Exhibit "M" which has to be pulled down the head. </p>
  <p> 2.  The identification of the accused in the police station was 
stage-managed.  The police line-up was conducted in the afternoon of 
April 13 but before that appellant was presented to Mary Alabat in the 
Prats' residence and, in both instances, she could only say "kasing laki
 niyan."
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  It was impossible for complainant to have a good look at the 
face of the culprit considering that there was no light in the room of 
the complainant save a night lamp which was dim and the culprit, upon 
entering the room, directed the beam of his flashlight at her face.  
When she gave a statement to the police the following day, April 12, 
1976, she made no mention of the culprit having a mustache which is the 
most noticeable feature of a man's face notwithstanding the fact that he
 did the sexual act for about ten (10) minutes (tsn., p. 9, November 15,
 1976 hearing).  It was only on April 13, 1976 after appellant, who 
sported a mustache, was shown to her twice that she gave another 
statement that the culprit was bemustached.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.  Fingerprints were lifted from complainant's bag and they did not match those of herein appellant's.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The trial court principally based its conviction of Eduarco Teaño upon 
the testimony of complainant Mary Alabat.  We have gone over the records
 of the case and, unhappily, Our minds cannot rest easy on the evidence 
of guilt addressed against the appellant.  The incident happened in the 
early morning of April 11, 1976 and at 8:45 in the morning of April 12, 
1976, she gave a statement to the police wherein she described her 
assailant as one who "stands about 5'4", regular built, long hair, brown
 complexion, wearing light brown sweater and colored bonnet" (Exhibit 
"K").  She could not tell the color of his pants and shoes.  However, at
 6:00 in the evening of April 13, 1976, she gave another statement 
(Exhibit "L") pointing to appellant Eduardo Teaño as the one who raped 
her, giving the following description:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "First, his mustache. </p>
  <p>
    Second, his sweater and bonnet which are similar with the sweater and bonnet he was wearing that night of the incident.
  </p>
  <p>
    Third, I am particular of his voice because he had a chance to be talking and asking questions with me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Fourth, that while he was doing the act of sexual intercourse with 
me, I smelt his hair and it smells the same pomade when I had the chance
 to smell his hair in the Baguio Police Station.
  </p>
  <p> Fifth, that he looks exactly the same in appearance, size and features." (p. 444, Record). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the basis of the two (2) statements given by complainant to the 
police can it be said that she made a clear and positive identification 
of the appellant?  In her first statement she made no mention that 
appellant has a mustache which she could not have escaped mentioning 
when she was interrogated by the police the day after the incident.  The
 next day, or on April 13, appellant was brought by the police to the 
Prats' residence and shown to the complainant (p. 13, tsn., February 3, 
1977 hearing).  In the afternoon, appellant appeared in a police line-up
 where he was identified by Mary Alabat who, thereafter, gave a second 
statement pointing to appellant who sports a mustache as the 
perpetrator.
</p><p>
The manner by which accused was presented to Mary Alabat at the Prats' 
residence in the morning and then her identification of appellant in a 
police line-up in the afternoon of the same day do not speak well of 
complainant's reliability as an eye witness.  Indeed, it is perplexing 
why Eduardo Teaño would still be placed in the police line-up for the 
purpose of his identifi­cation by Mary Alabat if in the morning of the 
same day he was already pointed to by her in the Prats' residence.  It 
is hard and dangerous for Us to accept her identification of the rapist 
and this includes her testimony in court considering that of the many 
fingerprints lifted at the Prats' residence none tallies with those of 
the appellant's.
</p><p>
Although the alibi offered by appellant Teaño may stand searching 
scrutiny, We will merely repeat the well-settled rule that alibi is the 
weakest defense an accused can avail of.  However, it acquires 
commensurate strength, where, as in this case, no positive and proper 
identification has been made by the offended party.  The prosecution has
 the<em> onus probandi</em> in establishing the guilt of the accused and
 the weakness of the defense does not relieve it of this responsibility 
(People vs. Baquiran, 20 SCRA 451, 460-461).  Stated differently, the 
prosecution must stand on the strength of its evidence and not on the 
weakness of the defense.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the judgment of the court a quo is REVERSED and appellant 
Eduardo Teaño y Rimando is hereby ACQUITTED on reasonable doubt.  Costs 
de oficio.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera, (Acting Chairman), Plana, Gutierrez, Jr.</em> and <em>De La Fuente</em>, JJ., concur.
