				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a direct appeal from the decision of the then Court of First Instance of Davao City, Branch II, finding petitioner Peter Paul Aballe y Mendoza guilty of homicide and sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty of eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> to sixteen (16) years of <i>reclusion temporal</i> with all the accessory penalties and ordering him to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Jennie Banguis y Aquino in the amount of P12,000.00 and to pay the amount of P5,000.00 as actual and compensatory damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>At around seven o'clock in the evening of November 7, 1980 in Saypon, Toril, Davao City, Quirino Banguis, a 42-year old driver, attended a birthday party at the residence of his neighbor Aguilles Mora.&nbsp; He brought along his wife and other children, leaving his 12-year-old daughter Jennie alone in their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Upon their return at around 8:30 that same night, Quirino found Jennie in the sala, lying prostrate, bathed in her own blood with multiple wounds on different parts of her body.&nbsp; There were no eyewitnesses to the bizarre killing.<br><br>The postmortem report disclosed that Jennie sustained a total of thirty-two (32) stab wounds.&nbsp; Cause of death was attributed to hemorrhage secondary to multiple stab wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>At daybreak of the following day, November 8, 1980, acting on information furnished by the victim's father, a police team headed by Sergeant Herminigildo Marante sought the accused Peter Paul Aballe for questioning.&nbsp; They found him just as he was coming out of the communal bathroom in Saypon and wearing what appeared to be a bloodstained T-shirt.&nbsp; Upon seeing Sgt. Marante, the accused without anyone asking him, orally admitted that he killed Jennie Banguis.&nbsp; Sgt. Marante subsequently brought him to the Toril police station for interrogation.<br><br>While under custodial investigation, Aballe, 17 years old, a school dropout (he finished second year high school) and next door neighbor of the victim, brought the police to his house and pointed to them the pot at the "bangera" where he had concealed the death weapon which was a four-inch kitchen knife.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Also taken from Aballe was the bloodstained red and white striped T-shirt which he claimed he wore during the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Aballe also made an extra judicial confession admitting his guilt in killing Jennie while under the influence of liquor and marijuana.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The sworn affidavit in the main reads as follows:<br><br><table Â ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"Preliminary Question: </div></td> <td width="80%"><div align="justify">Mr. Aballe, you are under investigation in connection with an offense.

Throughout the custodial interrogation, the accused's parents and relatives were almost always around but at no stage of the entire proceedings was it shown that the youthful offender was ever represented by counsel.&nbsp; Since the execution of the extrajudicial statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was admittedly made in the absence of counsel, whether <i>de oficio</i> or <i>de parte,</i> and the waiver of counsel was not made with the assistance of counsel as mandated by the provisions of Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution, said confession should have been discarded by the lower court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Indeed, equally inadmissible is the kitchen knife<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> recovered from Aballe after his capture and after the police had started to question him.&nbsp; Together with the extrajudicial confession, the fatal weapon is but a fruit of a constitutionally infirmed interrogation and must consequently be disallowed.&nbsp; The bloodstained T-shirt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> however, is admissible, being in the nature of an evidence in plain view<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> which an arresting officer may take and introduce in evidence.&nbsp; The prevailing rule in this jurisdiction is that "an officer making an arrest may take from the person arrested any money or property found upon his person which was used in the commission of the crime or was the fruit of the crime or which might furnish the prisoner with the means of committing violence or escaping, or which may be used in evidence in the trial of the cause..."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>But even with the exclusion of the extrajudicial confession and the fatal weapon we agree with the trial court that the guilt of the accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; It is well to note that even before the taking of the extrajudicial confession, the accused, upon being picked up in the morning of November 8, 1980 as he was coming out of the communal bathroom and wearing a T-shirt covered with bloodstains which he tried to cover with his hands, suddenly broke down and knelt before Sgt. Marante and confessed that he killed Jennie Banguis.&nbsp; The testimony of Sgt. Marante on Aballe's oral confession is competent evidence to positively link the accused to the aforesaid killing.&nbsp; His testimony reads in part:<br><br><table Â ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">"Q: -</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">In the morning of November 8, 1980, where were you at that time?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A: -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">At the police station.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q: -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">And could you tell us of any unusual incident?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A: - </div></td> <td><div align="justify">The father of the deceased came to the office and he told us that he suspected somebody whom he observed to be suspicious so we responded immediately to the call of assistance of the father and went back to the scene of the incident and asked for the whereabouts of the person whom he confided to us the name.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q: -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">And what did you find out?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A: -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Somebody told us that the subject was still in a common bathroom so I posted myself outside the bathroom.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q: - </div></td> <td><div align="justify">This subject you are referring to Sgt.
