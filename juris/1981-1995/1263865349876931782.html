<blockquote>[O]n September 7, 1985, at about 10:00
o’clock in the morning [should be around 12:00 o’clock midnight of September 7,
1985 (June 6, 1986 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., p. 15; June 27, 1986 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 7)], Roselyn <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>-Herrera,
while sleeping in their house at 8:30 (earlier) in the evening at Lopez <span class="SpellE">Jaena</span> St. at <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City, was
awakened by a tricycle parking <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>front of their house and shouts of
‘Dennis’ ‘Dennis’ were heard and which she ignored because the men who alighted
from the tricycle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">were </span>still on the street; that she then heard the gate open and
when she peeped out of the window she saw them inside the yard; one was already
in front of the window and ordered her to open the door, while the other was
already at the door and said he would want to talk to Dennis.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>So, she turned on the light on the front door as the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> was already lighted and the accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span> y <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> with someone
behind him told her they wanted to talk to her husband, Dennis Herrera and when
she replied that it would be alright for them to tell her what they wanted,
she, being his wife would be just like telling Dennis; but they both disagreed
and so she was forced to wake up her husband and as they came out of the room
towards the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and when her husband asked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">them </span>why, he was shot point blank and
witness, fearing for the safety of her daughter inside the bedroom, skipped
inside to get her nine year-old daughter and laid her down to the floor so that
she would not be hit and when she returned to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
she saw the accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span> shooting at her
husband while Carlos <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Alot</span> suddenly headed towards her in order to shoot her;
that while her husband was <span class="SpellE">alrea</span>[d]y lying on his
belly, he was still being shot at by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span>
and so she locked herself inside the room; that one of the shots hit the closet
of her daughter and another the typewriter; that the shooting took about 15
minutes while she just kept shouting inside the bedroom and in the process, one
of her daughters was aroused and who told her that the gunmen had left and so
she went out of the room she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">saw</span>
her husband, Dennis Herrera wallowed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(sic)
in the pool of his own blood. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Hysterical and shocked, she cried out and shouted running out of
the house and when she saw that many people already approaching and who brought
her husband to Bautista Hospital, she was left behind with her children waiting
for the policemen to come and conduct an investigation and after quite a lapse
of time, policemen arrived and went inside the house and looked around, while a
certain Fred <span class="SpellE">Agana</span>, an official photographer of the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City Integrated National Police took pictures of the
house, a picture of screened door showing the point of entry of the bullets,
which according to the policemen there were six points of entry, while the
counsel for the accused insisted that there were at least eight holes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Likewise the spot on which the deceased was sprawled and the pool
of blood around him while portions of the house where slugs were found were
also depicted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She then went to the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City police station at about 9:10 a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.m. </span>of the same morning, where she
picked out picture of the accused Ramon <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span> y <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, whom she did not know before the incident from the
<span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City police station’s rogues gallery and whom
she identified as black with curly hair with bulging eyes and that of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Baldomero</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Alot</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Later on, she pointed to the accused <span class="GramE">who</span>
was ranged in a police line-up inside the City jail along with other prisoners
after Ramon <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span> was fetched from his residence
and who voluntarily surrendered.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 29-32)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp; </span>this appeal, the accused raises a sole assignment of error, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE HEREIN ACCUSED-APPELLANT
OF THE CRIME OF MURDER, THE CRIME PROVED BEING ONLY ONE OF HOMICIDE.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 63)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The appellant’s
contention is devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
records clearly show the presence of the qualifying circumstances of treachery
and evident premeditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The accused-appellant
contends that even if the attack is sudden, it is not sufficient to prove
treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of this defense,
he cites the cases of People v. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, 148 SCRA 147
[1987] and People v. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, 148 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">SCRA 98 [1987].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of the present case are different from those of the cases he
mentions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For one, the prosecution
witness in the <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> case did not actually see the
killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conviction was on the basis of
circumstantial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the <span class="GramE">prosecution witness</span> in the case at bar saw
the accused shoot the victim as she was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">only </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a few feet away
from them when her husband was killed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> case, the accused stabbed the
victim while the two were facing each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The victim had the opportunity to defend himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The present case is,
however, different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused was
positively identified by the wife of the victim and the attack while frontal
did not offer the victim any opportunity for defense as he had just risen from
his sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Perante</span>, Jr., 143 SCRA 56 [1986] states that there is
treachery when the victim had just awakened and might still be dazed and
unprepared for the attack and would not be in a position to offer any risk or
danger of retaliation to the attacker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The various circumstances surrounding the shooting from the time they
entered the house, forced the wife to wake up her husband, and immediately
pumped him with bullets as he came out into the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
indicate a treacherous attack which left no opportunity to the victim to defend
himself and which insured the killing with absolutely no risk to the killers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The fact that the
victim’s wife saw the accused-appellant shoot the victim belies the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> denials and alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Parilla</span>,
144 SCRA 454 [1986]) It was Roselyn Herrera whom they earlier talked to and she
was a few feet away from her husband when he was shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The wife herself barely escaped being killed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">As stated in an earlier
case, the negative assertion that accused did not stab the victim cannot
prevail over the positive testimony of the prosecution witness x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (People v. <span class="SpellE">Amoncio</span>, 144 SCRA 384 [1986]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is not disputed that the appellant and the victim
were at the same party prior to the incident and that the appellant was hit
with a beer bottle by the victim and suffered injuries during the
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was motive for the
killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the allegation of the absence of evident premeditation, the
accused merely states that this circumstance was absent in the trial court’s
finding but he makes no attempt to satisfactorily substantiate his point.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court correctly appreciated the qualifying
circumstance of evident premeditation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused had reason to commit the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show that during the birthday
party of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>, Dennis Herrera hit the
accused-appellant on the face at about 5:30 in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At 9:00 in the evening, they were brought to
the police station but <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span> declined to file
charges despite the injuries he had sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to the trial court, the accused <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span>
thought of retaliating against the victim rather than filing charges against
him which was the lawful and natural procedure as he was already in the police
station and his own step brother, Captain Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span>
was Operations Officer of the police force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, between 12:00 midnight and 1:00 in the morning, he and his
co-accused went to the victim’s house which is a manifestation of his determination
to cling to his plan to kill the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the accused-appellant that the use of motor vehicle
and the circumstance of nighttime are not aggravating circumstances in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused rode in a motor
vehicle but it was not a “means” used to commit the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the motor vehicle
was used precisely to facilitate the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, nighttime was not especially
sought in the commission of the crime as the house was adequately lighted at
the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence does not
establish that the appellant took advantage of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>,
that he especially sought the coming of night, and that it was not simply the
effect of a succession of events from the brawl to the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">These notwithstanding, the
crime committed is</span> still murder considering the aggravating
circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span> voluntarily went with the police does not negate
liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was positively identified
by the victim’s wife as one of the assailants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Neither will the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> assertion of the absence of paraffin traces prove
his innocence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by Aida <span class="SpellE">Magsipoc</span>, Research Biologist of the NBI who </span>conducted
the paraffin test on <span class="SpellE">Rebullar</span>, negative findings on
the paraffin test does not mean that he did not fire a gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, there is a great possibility
that there will be no paraffin traces on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">hand if the bullet was fired from a .45 caliber pistol.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>“On questioning by the Court, witness cited several factors wherein
a person who has fired his firearm but was negative for nitrates; the type of
the caliber of the ammunition of the firearm itself; a new firearm or revolver
type would be so close that nitrates could not escape from the bridge of the
gun, whereas an old firearm where the mechanism is already a little bit loose,
more nitrates appear in the subject who fired the gun; the direction of the
wind if the subject is firing the firearm against the target, the nitrates will
be blown away from the scene and so he would also be negative of nitrates;
depending on the velocity of the wind, humidity of the area where the shooting
happened; in a closed room or place and there is no wind on or against the firearm,
he could be positive for nitrates; whereas outside the room he would be
negative and the less humid the area the less fall of nitrates on the subject,
and another possibility is if the subject is using something to cover his hand
firing the gun it would be negative for nitrates and in using a 45 caliber gun,
which has a close and tight compartment where the bullet is set and with the
revolver type firearm which has an open chamber, the former has a greater
possibility that he would be negative for nitrates.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
37-38)</blockquote>
