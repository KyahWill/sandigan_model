<p>
On April 14, 1962, Conrado G. de Leon filed in the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal at Quezon City a complaint for infringement of patent 
against Domiciano A. Aguas and F.H. Aquino and Sons alleging that being 
the original first and sole inventor of certain new and useful 
improvements in the process of making mosaic pre-cast tiles, he lawfully
 filed and prosecuted an application for Philippine patent, and having 
complied in all respects with the statute and the rules of the 
Philippines Patent Office, Patent No. 658 was lawfully granted and 
issued to him; that said invention was new, useful, not known or used by
 others in this country before his invention thereof, not patented or 
described in any printed publication anywhere before his invention 
thereof, or more than one year prior to his application for patent 
therefor, not patented in any foreign country by him or his legal 
representatives on application filed more than one year prior to his 
application in this country; that plaintiff has the exclusive license to
 make, use and sell throughout the Philippines the improvements set 
forth in said Letters Patent No. 658; that the invention patented by 
said Patent No. 658 is of great utility and of great value to plaintiff 
and of great benefit to the public who has demanded and purchased tiles 
embodying the said invention in very large quantities and in very 
rapidly increasing quantities; that he has complied with the Philippine 
statutes relating to marking patented tiles sold by him; that the public
 has in general acknowledged the validity of said Patent No. 658, and 
has respected plaintiff's right therein and thereunder; that the 
defendant Domiciano A. Aguas infringed Letters of Patent No. 658 by 
making, using and selling tiles embodying said patented invention and 
that defendant F.H. Aquino &amp; Sons is guilty of infringement by 
making and furnishing to the defendant Domiciano A. Aguas the 
engravings, castings and devices designed and intended for use and 
actually used in apparatus for the making of tiles embodying plaintiff's
 patented invention; that he has given direct and personal notice to the
 defendants of their said acts of infringement and requested them to 
desist, but nevertheless, defendants have refused and neglected to 
desist and have disregarded such request, and continue to so infringe 
causing great and irreparable damage to plaintiff; that if the aforesaid
 infringement is permitted to continue, further losses and damages and 
irreparable injury will be sustained by the plaintiff; that there is an 
urgent need for the immediate issuance of a preliminary injunction; that
 as a result of the defendants' wrongful conduct, plaintiff has suffered
 and the defendants are liable to pay him, in addition to actual damages
 and loss of profits which would be determined upon proper accounting, 
moral and exemplary or corrective damages in the sum of P90,000.00; that
 plaintiff has been compelled to go to court for the protection and 
enforcement of his patent rights as against the defendants' act of 
infringement and to engage the services of counsel, thereby incurring 
attorney's fees and expenses of litigation in the sum of P5,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
On April 14, 1962, an order granting the plaintiff's petition for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction was issued.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
On May 23, 1962, the defendant Domiciano A. Aguas filed his answer 
denying the allegations of the plaintiff and alleging that:  the 
plaintiff is neither the original first nor sole inventor of the 
improvements in the process of making mosaic pre-cast tiles, the same 
having been used by several tile-making factories in the Philippines and
 abroad years before the alleged invention by de Leon; that Letters 
Patent No. 658 was unlawfully acquired by making it appear in the 
application in relation thereto that the process is new and that the 
plaintiff is the owner of the process when in truth and in fact the 
process incorporated in the patent application has been known and used 
in the Philippines by almost all tile makers long before the alleged use
 and registration of patent by plaintiff Conrado G. de Leon; that the 
registration of the alleged invention did not confer any right on the 
plaintiff because the registration was unlawfully secured and was a 
result of the gross misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiff that 
his alleged invention is a new and inventive process; that the 
allegation of the plaintiff that Patent No. 658 is of great value to 
plaintiff and of great benefit to the public is a mere conclusion of the
 plaintiff, the truth being that a) the invention of plaintiff is 
neither inventive nor new, hence, it is not patentable; b) defendant has
 been granted valid patents (Patents No. 108, 109, 110 issued on 
December 21, 1961) on designs for concrete decorative wall tiles; and c)
 that he can not be guilty of infringement because his products are 
different from those of the plaintiff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>

<p>
On August 5, 1969, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the 
trial court, with the modification that plaintiff-appellee's award of 
moral damages was reduced to P3,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
The petitioner assigns the following errors supposedly committed by the Court of Appeals:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is now respectfully submitted that the Court of Appeals committed the following errors involving questions of law, to wit: </p>
  <p> "First error.  - When it did not conclude that the letters patent 
of the respondent although entitled on the cover page as a patent for 
improvements, was in truth and in fact, on the basis of the body of the 
same, a patent for the old and non-patentable process of making mosaic 
pre-cast tiles; </p>
  <p> "Second error.  - When it did not conclude from the admitted facts
 of the case, particularly the contents of the letters patent, Exh. L, 
and the pieces of physical evidence introduced consisting of samples of 
the tiles and catalogues, that the alleged improvements introduced by 
the respondent in the manufacture of mosaic pre-cast tiles are not 
patentable, the same being not new, useful and inventive. </p>
  <p> "Third error.  - As a corollary, when it sentenced the herein 
petitioner to pay the damages enumerated in the decision of the lower 
court (Record on Appeal, pp. 74-75), as confirmed by it (the Court of

damages was reduced to P3,000."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The basic facts borne out by the record are to the effect that on
 December 1, 1959, plaintiff-appellee filed a patent application with 
the Philippine Patent Office, and on May 5, 1960, said office issued in 
his favor Letters Patent No. 658 for a 'new and useful improvement in 
the process of making mosaic pre-cast tiles' (Exh. "L"); that defendant 
F.H. Aquino &amp; Sons engraved the moulds embodying plaintiff's 
patented improvement for the manufacture of pre-cast tiles, plaintiff 
furnishing said defendant the actual model of the said tiles in escayola
 and explained to said engraver the plans, specifications and the 
details of the engravings as he wanted them to be made, including an 
explanation of the lip width, artistic slope of easement and critical 
depth of the engraving that plaintiff wanted for his moulds; that 
engraver Enrique Aquino knew that the moulds he was engraving for 
plaintiff were the latter's very own, which possessed the new features 
and characteristics covered by plaintiff's patent; that defendant Aguas 
personally, as a building contractor, purchased from plaintiff, tiles 
shaped out of these moulds at the back of which was imprinted 
plaintiff’s patent number (Exhs. "A" to "E"); that subsequently, through
 a representative, Mr. Leonardo, defendant Aguas requested Aquino to 
make engravings of the same type and bearing the characteristics of 
plaintiff's moulds; that Mr. Aquino knew that the moulds he was asked to
 engrave for defendant Aguas would be used to produce cement tiles 
similar to plaintiff's; that the moulds which F.H. Aquino &amp; Sons 
eventually engraved for Aguas and for which it charged Aguas double the 
rate it charged plaintiff De Leon, contain the very same characteristic 
features of plaintiff's mould and that Aguas used these moulds in the 
manufacture of his tiles which he actually put out for sale to the 
public (Exhs. "1" to "3" and Exhs. "A" to "E"); that both plaintiff's 
and defendant Aguas' tiles are sculptured pre-cast wall tiles intended 
as a new feature of construction and wall ornamentation substantially 
identical to each other in size, easement, lip width and critical depth 
of the deepest depression; and that the only significant difference 
between plaintiff's mould and that engraved by Aquino for Aguas is that,
 whereas plaintiff's mould turns out tiles 4 x 4 inches in size, 
defendant Aguas' mould is made to 4-1/4 x 4-1/4 inch tile."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The patent right of the private respondent expired on May 5, 1977.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  The errors will be discussed only to determine the right of said private respondent to damages.
</p><p>
The petitioner questioned the validity of the patent of the private 
respondent, Conrado G. de Leon, on the ground that the process, subject 
of said patent, is not an invention or discovery, or an improvement of 
the old system of making tiles.  It should be noted that the private 
respondent does not claim to be the discoverer or inventor of the old 
process of tile-making.  He only claims to have introduced an 
improvement of said process.  In fact, Letters Patent No. 658 was issued
 by the Philippine Patent Office to the private respondent, Conrado G. 
de Leon, to protect his rights as the inventor of "an alleged new and 
useful improvement in the process of making mosaic pre-cast tiles."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  Indeed, Section 7, Republic Act No. 165, as amended, provides:  "Any 
invention of a new and useful machine, manufactured product or 
substance, process, or an improvement of the foregoing, shall be 
patentable."
</p><p>
The Court of Appeals found that the private respondent has introduced an improvement in the process of tile-making because:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x we find that plaintiff-appellee has introduced an 
improvement in the process of tile-making, which proceeds not merely 
from mechanical skill, said improvement consisting among other things, 
in the new critical depth, lip width, easement and field of designs of 
the new tiles.  The improved lip width of appellee's tiles ensures the 
durability of the finished product preventing the flaking off of the 
edges.  The easement caused by the inclination of the protrusions of the
 patented moulds is for the purpose of facilitating the removal of the 
newly processed tile from the female die.  Evidently, appellee's 
improvement consists in the solution to the old critical problem by 
making the protrusions on his moulds attain an optimum height, so that 
the engraving thereon would be deep enough to produce tiles for 
sculptured and decorative purposes, strong enough, notwithstanding the 
deep engravings, to be utilized for walling purposes.  The optimum 
thickness of appellee's new tiles of only 1/8 of an inch at the deepest 
easement (Exhs. "D" and "D-1") is a most critical feature, suggestive of
 discovery and inventiveness, especially considering that, despite said 
thinness, the freshly formed tile remains strong enough for its intended
 purpose. </p>
  <p> "While it is true that the matter of easement, lip width, depth, 
protrusions and depressions are known to some sculptors, still, to be 
able to produce a new and useful wall tile, by using them all together, 
amounts to an invention.  More so, if the totality of all these features
 are viewed in combination with the ideal composition of cement, sodium 
silicate and screened fine sand. </p>
  <p> "By using his improved process, plaintiff has succeeded in 
producing a new product - a concrete sculptured tile which could be 
utilized for walling and decorative purposes.  No proof was adduced to 
show that any tile of the same kind had been produced by others before 
appellee.  Moreover, it appears that appellee has been deriving 
considerable profit from his manufacture and sale of such tiles.  This 
commercial success is evidence of patentability (Walker on Patents, 
Deller's Edition, Vol. I, p. 237)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The validity of the patent issued by the Philippines Patent Office in 
favor of the private respondent and the question over the inventiveness,
 novelty and usefulness of the improved process therein specified and 
described are matters which are better determined by the Philippines 
Patent Office.  The technical staff of the Philippines Patent Office, 
composed of experts in their field, have, by the issuance of the patent 
in question, accepted the thinness of the private respondent's new tiles
 as a discovery.  There is a presumption that the Philippines Patent 
Office has correctly determined the patentability of the improvement by 
the private respondent of the process in question.
</p><p>
Anent this matter, the Court of Appeals said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Appellant has not adduced evidence sufficient to overcome the 
above established legal presumption of validity or to warrant reversal 
of the findings of the lower court relative to the validity of the 
patent in question.  In fact, as we have already pointed out, the clear 
preponderance of evidence bolsters said presumption of validity of 
appellee's patent.  There is no indication in the records of this case -
 and this Court is unaware of any fact, which would tend to show that 
concrete wall tiles similar to those produced by appellee had ever been 
made by others before he started manufacturing the same.  In fact, 
during the trial, appellant was challenged by appellee to present a tile
 of the same kind as those produced by the latter, from any earlier 
source but, despite the fact that appellant had every chance to do so, 
he could not present any.  There is, therefore, no concrete proof that 
the improved process of tile-making described in appellee's patent was 
used by, or known to, others previous to his discovery thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The contention of the petitioner Aguas that the letters-patent of de 
Leon was actually a patent for the old and non-patentable process of 
making mosaic pre-cast tiles is devoid of merit. De Leon never claimed 
to have invented the process of tile-making.  The Claims and 
Specifications of Patent No. 658 show that although some of the steps or
 parts of the old process of tile-making were described therein, there 
were novel and inventive features mentioned in the process.  Some of the
 novel features of the private respondent's improvements are the 
following:  critical depth, with corresponding easement and lip width to
 such degree as leaves the tile as thin as 1/8 of an inch at its 
thinnest portion, ideal composition of cement and fine river sand, among
 other ingredients that makes possible the production of tough and 
durable wall tiles, though thin and light; the engraving of deep designs
 in such a way as to make the tiles decorative, artistic and suitable 
for wall ornamentation, and the fact that the tiles can be mass produced
 in commercial quantities and can be conveniently stockpiled, handled 
and packed without any intolerable incidence of breakages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
</p><p>
The petitioner also contends that the improvement of respondent is not 
patentable because it is not new, useful and inventive.  This contention
 is without merit.
</p><p>
The records disclose that de Leon's process is an improvement of the old
 process of tile making.  The tiles produced from de Leon's process are 
suitable for construction and ornamentation, which previously had not 
been achieved by tiles made out of the old process of tile making.  De 
Leon's invention has therefore brought about a new and useful kind of 
tile.  The old type of tiles were usually intended for floors although 
there is nothing to prevent one from using them for walling purposes.  
These tiles are neither artistic nor ornamental.  They are heavy and 
massive.
</p><p>
The respondent's improvement is indeed inventive and goes beyond the 
exercise of mechanical skill.  He has introduced a new kind of tile for a
 new purpose.  He has improved the old method of making tiles and 
pre-cast articles which were not satisfactory because of an intolerable 
number of breakages, especially if deep engravings are made on the tile.
  He has overcome the problem of producing decorative tiles with deep 
engraving, but with sufficient durability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
  Durability inspite of the thinness and lightness of the tile, is 
assured, provided that a certain critical depth is maintained in 
relation to the dimensions of the tile.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
</p><p>
The petitioner also claims that changing the design from embossed to 
engraved tiles is neither new nor inventive because the Machuca Tile 
Factory and the Pomona Tile Manufacturing Company have been 
manufacturing decorative wall tiles that are embossed as well as 
engraved;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  that these tiles have also depth, lip width, easement and field of designs;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  and that the private respondent had copied some designs of Pomona.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Machuca tiles are different from that of the private respondent.  
The designs are embossed and not engraved as claimed by the petitioner. 
 There may be depressions but these depressions are too shallow to be 
considered engraved.  Besides, the Machuca tiles are heavy and massive.
</p><p>
There is no similarity between the Pomona Tiles and de Leon's tiles.  The Pomona tiles are made of ceramics.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
  The process involved in making cement tiles is different from ceramic 
tiles.  Cement tiles are made with the use of water, while in ceramics 
fire is used.  As regards the allegation of the petitioner that the 
private respondent copied some designs of Pomona, suffice it to say that
 what is in issue here is the process involved in tile-making and not 
the design.
</p><p>
In view of the foregoing, this Court finds that Patent No. 658 was 
legally issued, the process and/or improvement being patentable.
</p><p>
Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found as a fact that the 
petitioner Domiciano A. Aguas did infringe de Leon's patent.  There is 
no showing that this case falls under one of the exceptions when this 
Court may overrule the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals.  The 
only issue then to be resolved is the amount of damages that should be 
paid by Aguas.
</p><p>
In its decision the Court of Appeals affirmed the amount of damages 
awarded by the lower court with the modification that the respondent is 
only entitled to P3,000.00 moral damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> 
</p><p>
The lower court awarded the following damages:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    a)      P10,020,99 by way of actual damages;
  </p>
  <p>
    b)      P50,000.00 by way of moral damages;
  </p>
  <p>
    c)      P5,000.00 by way of exemplary damages;
  </p>
  <p>
    d)      P5,000.00 by way of attorney's fees and
  </p>
  <p>
    e)      Costs of suit
  </p>
  <p>
  because:
  </p>
  <p> "An examination of the books of defendant Aguas made before a 
Commissioner reveals that during the period that Aguas was manufacturing
 and selling tiles similar to plaintiff's, he made a gross income of 
P3,340.33, which can be safely be considered the amount by which he 
enriched himself when he infringed plaintiff's patent.  Under Sec. 42 of
 the Patent Law any patentee whose rights have been infringed is 
entitled to damages which, according to the circumstances of the case 
may be in a sum above the amount found as actual damages sustained 
provided the award does not exceed three times the amount of such actual
 damages.  Considering the wantonness of the infringement committed by 
the defendants who knew all the time about the existence of plaintiff's 
patent, the Court feels there is reason to grant plaintiff maximum 
damages in the sum of P10,020.99.  And in order to discourage patent 
infringements and to give more teeth to the provisions of the patent law
 thus promoting a stronger public policy committed to afford greater 
incentives and protection to inventors, the Court hereby awards 
plaintiff exemplary damages in the sum of P5,000.00 to be paid jointly 
and severally by defendants.  Considering the status of plaintiff as a 
reputable businessman, and owner of the likewise reputed House of 
Pre-Cast, he is entitled to an award of moral damages in the sum of 
P50,000.00."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In reducing the amount of moral damages the Court of Appeals said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "As regards the question of moral damages it has been shown that 
as a result of the unlawful acts of infringement committed by 
defendants, plaintiff was understandably very sad; he worried and became
 nervous and lost concentration on his work in connection with his tile 
business (pp. 28, 30, t.s.n., Feb. 28, 1964).  In addition, plaintiff's 
character and reputation have been unnecessarily put in question because
 defendants, by their acts of infringement have created a doubt or 
suspicion in the public mind concerning the truth and honesty of 
plaintiff's advertisements and public announcements of his valid patent.
  Necessarily, said acts of defendants have caused plaintiff 
considerable mental suffering, considering especially, the fact that he 
staked everything on his pre-cast tile business (p. 36, t.s.n., Id.). 
The wantonness and evident bad faith characterizing defendants’ 
prejudicial acts against plaintiff justify the assessment of moral 
damages in plaintiff's favor, though we do not believe the amount of 
P50,000.00 awarded by the lower court is warranted by the circumstances.
  We feel that said amount should be reduced to P3,000.00 by way of 
compensating appellee for his moral suffering 'Willful injury to 
property may be a legal ground for awarding moral damages if the court 
should find that, under the circumstances such damages are justly due' 
(Art. 2219 NCC).”
