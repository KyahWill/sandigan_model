<p class="BODY">The brief of the People states, briefly but comprehensively, the
nature of the case and the facts:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1972</st1:date>,
a complaint for murder was filed by Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Esmeraldo</span> G.
Romero against appellant <span class="SpellE">Vitaliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Marianito</span> <span class="SpellE">Claros</span> (p. 4, records).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, conducted a preliminary
examination of the case, docketed as <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case 1070,
and found a prima facie case against the appellant only and ordered his
arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It dismissed the complaint as
against <span class="SpellE">Marianito</span> <span class="SpellE">Claros</span>
(p. 14, records).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1975</st1:date>,
presumably after the capture of appellant, the case was remanded for trial to
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> (p. 17,
records), appellant, having waived the second stage of the preliminary
investigation (p. 17, records).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1976</st1:date>,
appellant was formally charged before the Circuit Criminal Court (7th Judicial
District) with Murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Information
in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case CCC-VII-1548 (<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>) partly reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'That on or about April 1, 1972, in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>, Province, of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused armed with a bolo locally called '<span class="SpellE">barang</span>',
with intent to kill, treachery and evident premeditation, did, then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and
hack with the said bolo one <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>, inflicting upon the latter, wounds on his neck and
head which cause his death' (p. 1, records).</p>

<blockquote>"Upon arraignment on <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="2">February
 5, 1976</st1:date>, appellant pleaded 'not guilty' (p. 25, records).</blockquote>

OF FACTS</span></p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1972</st1:date>,
in <span class="SpellE">Amaya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>, then 12 years old, was sitting by the window of
their house keeping an eye over her baby brother who was playing on the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the ground, just about three <span class="GramE">arms-length</span> from where she was sitting by the window, her
father, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>,
was cooking '<span class="SpellE">pata</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, Feb. 12, 1976, pp. 4, 7, 11, E. <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother
had earlier left for the town clinic to have her younger brother treated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An elder sister was also out buying something
from a store some distance away (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, March 25, 1976,
pp. 4-6, <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As <st1:city><st1:place>Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city> was
thus sitting by the window that afternoon, she saw <span class="SpellE">Marianito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Claros</span> approach her father and ask that his cigarette
be lighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After it was lighted, <span class="SpellE">Marianito</span> left and upon reaching the street, was met by
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a brief exchange of
words with appellant, <span class="SpellE">Claros</span> went his way.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant then approached <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> and also asked that his cigarette be lighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant asked <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>
what he was cooking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Matias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> replied he was making some '<span class="SpellE">pulutan</span>' for a little party the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant picked up the '<span class="SpellE">barang</span>'
(Exhibit 'D' - bolo) which was beside <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>, and asked if it was sharp.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The deceased, whose back was then towards appellant, answered
that it was, after which appellant hacked him three (3) times in quick
succession â€” at the nape, on the head and at the nape again, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> fell face down,
dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant dropped the bolo and ran
away (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, Feb. 12, 1976, pp. 7-10, E. <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That same day, Dr. Hernando <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>,
Rural Health Physician of <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>, examined the body of
the deceased at the latter's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
found that the deceased's skull was cracked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two wounds at the nape were both fatal, having severed the cervix
and the curative artery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor
asked the sanitary inspector to prepare an anatomical diagram showing the
wounds inflicted (Exhibit 'A').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
issued a death certificate wherein he attributed the cause of death to shock
and hemorrhage due to bolo wounds (Exhibit 'B'; <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
Feb. 10, 1976, pp. 2-8, <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, appellant fled from the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span class="SpellE">surendered</span> (or
was apprehended) only after Martial Law was declared (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
June 10, 1976, <span style="">p. </span>24, <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would
seem to be sometime in 1975 already as the Order of the Municipal Court
remanding the case for trial on the merits is dated August 25, 1975 (p. 17,
records)." (Pp. 1-5)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a painstaking review of the record and the transcript of
the stenographic notes taken at the trial, <span class="GramE">We</span> are
satisfied that the People's narration of the proven facts is not only accurate
but readily credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span> unhesitatingly
admitted having hacked his victim, <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>, but in an attempt to escape liability, presented
evidence tending to show self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, the only matter We have to determine in the instant review is
whether or not said evidence comes up to the long and well settled standard in
criminal prosecutions that in crimes against persons where the accused puts up
the defense of having acted in self-defense, the <u>onus</u> is on him to prove
such defense with clear, strong and convincing evidence, without relying on any
possible weakness of that of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Llonico</span>, 54 SCRA 172-184) As <span style="">stated in </span>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Llamera</span>, 51 SCRA 48, 57:</p>

<blockquote>"It is a well settled rule that one who admits the infliction
of injuries which caused the death of another has the burden of proving
self-defense with sufficient and convincing <span style="">evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>If such
evidence is of doubtful veracity, and is not clear and convincing, the defense
must necessarily fail, for <span style="">'having </span>admitted
that he was the author of the death of the deceased, it was incumbent upon
appellant, in order to avoid criminal liability, to prove the justifying
circumstance claimed by him' without relying on the weakness of that of the
prosecution but on the strength of his own evidence, for even if the evidence
of the prosecution were weak 'it could not be disbelieved after the accused himself
had admitted the killing' (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ansoyon</span>, 75
Phil. 772; People v. <span class="SpellE">Talaboc</span>, 30 SCRA 87; People v. <span class="SpellE">Berio</span>, 59 Phil. 533; People v. <span class="SpellE">Banden</span>,
77 Phil. 105; People v. Cruz, 53 Phil. 635; People v. Gutierrez, 53 Phil. 609;

1)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Conscious as <span class="GramE">We</span> are that this is a
capital case, We have taken a hard look at <span class="SpellE">Ciria's</span>
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version was substantially
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That at about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of April 1, 1972,
while he was searching for his lost pig, he passed by the house of his
neighborâ€“the victim <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>â€“which
was only eight (8) meters distant from his own home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He requested for drinking water from <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>, and the latter, who was then inside the house,
handed out to him the water as he (appellant) stood by the foot of the stairs;
from the foot of the stairs where he stood he saw his missing pig inside the
"<span class="SpellE">batalan</span>" of the house; the pig was then
slaughtered but not yet quartered; he demanded the return of his pig from <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>, but the latter refused to give it back to him for
the reason that it was already "compromised"; and when he insisted, <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> picked up his "<span class="SpellE">barang</span>"
from the floor of the house, got down and attacked him with it; as <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> launched at him, he moved one-arms length from him
and thereby avoided <span class="SpellE">Arahan's</span> first hacking blow, and
when the following assault came, he managed to grab the "<span class="SpellE">barang</span>" from the hand of <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>,
<u>albeit</u> in the process, he was hit with the said bolo or<span style=""> ''<span class="SpellE">b<span style="">arang</span></span></span>" on the
eyebrow on the right side of his forehead; after he obtained possession of the
bolo, he hacked <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> with it, face to face; it
happened so suddenly he could no longer recall the number of times he hacked <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>, and because he got scared when he saw blood on the
face of his victim, he dropped the bolo beside his fallen adversary and ran
away, far out to the irrigated <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span> some twenty
(20) kilometers away from the place, sat down to rest under a mango tree until
darkness settled; from there he proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Maragondon</span>
where he, stayed for a couple of years up to the mid-portion of the year 1975
when he finally decided to surrender to a barrio captain of the place."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are fully convinced that such version of accused <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span>, uncorroborated at that, cannot stand even cursory
scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is shot thru with immediately
unbelievable circumstances, for being obviously inconsistent with the ordinary
experience and conduct of man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claim
that he passed by the house of <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> while on his
way to look for his missing pig only to ask for drinking water is, to say the
least, unusual, considering that his own house was just beside that of <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>-barely eight (8) meters distant from each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, even assuming for the
sake of argument that he had really lost his pig, it is quite out of the
ordinary and difficult to believe that <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> would
have had the nerve and be so cynical as to slaughter in his own house a pig
stolen from his immediate neighbor, thereby easily exposing his misdeed to his
other neighbors who would no doubt hear siren-like wails the pig would make
while being slaughtered, and then leave it <span class="SpellE">unquartered</span>
on the floor of an open "<span class="SpellE">batalan</span>" for any
and all passersby to see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it is
entirely out of the ordinary for an alleged thief, like what appellant claimed <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> was, to simply reason out to the owner claiming back
his pig that he could no longer return it because it was already "compromised",
instead of at least denying outright the imputation against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, appellant could not even explain
satisfactorily how he managed to wrest the bolo from the hand of <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He merely
told the court that "because of the sudden happening, I was not able to
know how I was able to grab that bolo." (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, p.
41)</p>

<p class="BODY">Then too, appellant's claim that he had to hack <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> with the bolo as an act of self-defense because he
was placed in a tight situation and could not have moved away is difficult to
reconcile with his own admissions in his testimony that the fence on his left
towards the east had an opening of about 2-1/2 meters, and that after he had
wrested the bolo from <span class="SpellE">Arahan's</span> hand said victim no
longer rushed at him, and so, he was then in complete control not only of said
bolo but also of <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>, which proves indubitably
that at that precise point of time the alleged aggression against him, if ever
there was one, had already ceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
need was there then for him to hack his victim with the bolo three times in
successionâ€“to prevent or repel his alleged aggression against him?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last, but not least, appellant's insistence
that he hacked <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> with the latter's own bolo
frontally or face to face is belied completely by the location of the wounds he
inflicted on the said victim, first on the nape or back portion of the neck,
next at the back portion of the head, and then at the nape again, as testified
to by Elizabeth and confirmed by the medical findings of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Pulido</span>, the Assistant Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, who examined the deceased and caused to be
prepared under his direction, the report and diagram, Exhibit A, all of which
conclusively prove that the attack came from behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span> has utterly
failed to prove positively and convincingly the justifying circumstances of
self-defense he asserted and, therefore, the trial court did not err in not
appreciating the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under his third assignment of error, counsel for accused laments his
conviction and ascribes error to the trial court for allegedly having found him
guilty on the basis merely of the testimony of the lone witness for the
prosecution which, he claims further, is open to suspicion because the said
lone witness is the, daughter of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such pretension is simply not true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To begin with, <span class="GramE">appellant's</span> own testimony shows
conclusively that he alone inflicted the wounds which caused the death of <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
such admission of appellant, the only question left for this Court to decide,
as We have stated earlier, is whether or not he had really acted in
self-defense, and, as already discussed and pointed out above, accused utterly
failed to prove positively and convincingly any element of self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Independently, therefore, of the alleged
weakness of the evidence for the prosecution, appellant cannot avoid criminal
responsibility resulting from his admission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Actually, while it is true that Elizabeth was the lone
eye-witness to the killing of her father, her testimony before the court below
was not really the sole basis of appellant's conviction, because there was the
medico-legal officer's finding, after an examination of the nature and location
of the wounds of the victim, which indicates, as already pointed out, the
wounds inflicted on <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> were all from behind,
thereby corroborating Elizabeth's testimony that appellant hacked her father
three (3) times with a bolo as he was in the act of blowing the fire over which
he was then cooking a pig's "<span class="SpellE">pata</span>''.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the testimony of a single witness
may be sufficient to produce conviction, if it appears trustworthy and reliable
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Naba-unag</span>, 79 SCRA 32; People vs.
Salazar, 58 SCRA 467), which is exactly how <st1:city><st1:place>Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>'s
testimony appears to <span class="GramE">Us</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged suspicious character of <st1:city><st1:place>Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:city>'s
testimony because she is the daughter of the victim, it is to be noted that
appellant does not specifically point to any portion of her testimony which may
render it doubtful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span class="GramE">We</span> <span style="">find no reason at
all to reject the finding and conclusion of the trial court regarding her
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, suffice it to
say that relationship to the victim, standing by itself, does not prove that
the said witness is prejudiced and biased when, as in this case, said testimony
is not only clear and natural, but corroborated circumstantially by medical
findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Estocada</span>, 75 SCRA 295; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
73 </span>SCRA 583; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span>, 69 SCRA 172;

SCRA 385; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Asmamil</span>, 13 SCRA 497 and People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Libed</span>, 14 SCRA 410.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are fully and morally
convinced that the guilt of appellant <span class="SpellE">Vitaliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span> for the murder of <span class="SpellE">Matias</span> <span class="SpellE">Arahan</span> has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His conviction therefore follows as a matter
of course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, while he is indeed
guilty of murder, as observed by the Solicitor General in his brief, (p. 13),
no aggravating circumstance has been adequately established to warrant </span>the
<span style="">penalty of death imposed by the trial
court, and it should, therefore be reduced, as <span class="GramE">We</span> do
hereby reduce the same to RECLUSION PERPETUA.<span style="">&nbsp;
