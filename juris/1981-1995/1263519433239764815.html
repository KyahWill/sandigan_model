and P50,000.00, respectively, for the purpose of purchasing <span class="SpellE">rescada</span>

<p class="BODY">The only issue raised is whether or not the Court of Appeals
issued its decision with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess
of jurisdiction when it denied a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
filed by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, our policy in this Court towards invocation of
the right to appeal has been one of liberality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Delas</span> Alas v. Court of Appeals, 83 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 201).</p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, the instant petition itself <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>denied on <st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="12">December <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">9, </span>1977</st1:date>

</span>Nevertheless, this Court reconsidered the resolution and eventually gave
due course to the petition upon pleas that justice would thereby be served.</p>

<p class="BODY">An appeal is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">an </span>essential
part of our judicial system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">We </span>have advised the courts to proceed
with caution so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span>not to deprive
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>party of the right to appeal
(National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority v. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Libmanan</span>, 97 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 138) and ins­tructed
that every party-litigant should be afforded the amplest opportunity for the
proper and just dis­position of his cause, freed from the constraints of
technicalities (A-One Feeds, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 100 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
590).</p>

<p class="BODY">The rules of procedure are not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">to </span>be applied in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>very
rigid and technical sense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rules of
procedure are used only to help secure not override substantial justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Gregorio <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">v. </span>Court of Appeals, 72 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 120).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, we ruled in <u>Republic v. Court of Appeals</u> (83 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 453) that a six-day delay in the perfection of the
appeal does not warrant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">its
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And again in </span><u>Ramos
v. <span class="SpellE">Bagasao</span></u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(96
<span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 395), this Court held that the delay of four (4)
days in filing a notice of appeal and a motion for extension of time to file a
record on appeal can be excused on the basis of equity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Where the interests of justice would not be served by a policy of
liberality, however, we cannot cite a lower court as having acted with grave
abuse of discretion simply because it has correctly but strictly applied the
rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the decision
of the respondent court is supported by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A remand for further proceedings, therefore,
would only result in needless delays - <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">few </span>more years perhaps of
a tortuous journey <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">through </span>new
proceedings in the trial court, an intermediate appeal, and another resort to
this Court through a petition for review to finally achieve the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">same </span>result which is an order to pay
an admitted indebtedness.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The complaint filed by
the private respondent stated that the petitioners secured two separate amounts
of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and P50,000.00 to buy <span class="SpellE">rescada</span> copra for delivery to Cheng Ban <span class="SpellE">Yek</span>
Company but after delivering only P23,299.28 worth of copra, misappropriated
the rest of the money given to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of the petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">admitted the </span>receipt of the amounts alleged in the complaint but
denied that they were received through fraud and misrepresentation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The couple admitted that they were indebted
in the amount of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to Mr. Victor <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> Laurel, that the debt was subject to liquidation
through monthly installments of P2,000.00 each and that they had already paid
nine installments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners also
questioned <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1976</st1:date>
as the date of receipt, saying they did not receive the money on that date.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners likewise admitted the second indebtedness of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in their answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They averred, however, that the real contract between them executed on
the same date was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>loan for
copra t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">o </span>be delivered to <span class="SpellE">Vimarco</span>, Inc., that it expressly states the date of
execution and date of expiration, the amount of copra to be delivered, as well
as the agreed price thereof and that the document was signed by the
representatives of the plaintiff and of the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners averred in their answer that they had been
transacting business for several years without any conflict or disagreement
through the founder and actual manager, Mr. Victor <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>
Laurel and that in practice, deliveries of copra were made and accepted even
after the lapse of the agreed period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
connection with the petition for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">issuance
</span>of a writ of preliminary attachment and the motion to dissolve the writ
which had been issued, the parties also submitted various documents and other
evidences.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As earlier stated, private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">respondent </span><span class="SpellE">Vimarco</span>,

motion and the opposition thereto, the trial court rendered the deci­sion which
was later appealed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>the Court
of Appeals <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">but </span>one day late.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the court of first instance states:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon a further perusal of the record, the Court finds it
undisputed that the defendants-spouses received from, and are indebted to, the
plain­tiff in the sums of P200<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and P50,000.00,
respectively, for which the defendants, in their answer, ad­mitted being liable
to the plaintiff although they claim they have already made partial payments to
the latter, i.e. P18,000.00 of the P200,000.00 and P23,299.28 of the
P50,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">partial </span><span class="GramE">payments made by the defen­dants to
the plaintiff is</span> a clear proof by itself that the monetary obligations
by the former to the lat­ter under Annexes A and B of the complaint are already
due and demand­able.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Granting, <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>, that the real agreement between the parties with
respect to the P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> is that which is covered by
Annex 1 of the answer and not Annex B of the complaint, none­theless, it
appears that even under the document marked as Annex 1 of the answer, the
defendants were already liable to the plaintiff as of April 13, 1976 at which
date they were already <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span><span class="SpellE">mora</span></u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And on the
matter of the P200,000.00, granting again, for the sake of arguments, the claim
of the defendants that they did not receive the said amount from the plaintiff
on March 26, 1976 as per Annex A of the complaint to be true, the fact remains,
as admitted by the defendants in their answer, that at one time or another they
received the said amount from the plaintiff for which, equity and law demand,
they should restitute to the plaintiff now that it has already become due and
demandable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is seriously
doubted whether the defendants can question the genuineness and due execution
of the document marked as Annex A of the complaint in view of their failure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to make a specific denial thereof under oath
as required by the rules.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"From the foregoing, <span class="GramE">its</span> quite clear that the plaintiff is entitled to a judgment
on the pleadings considering that the answer of the defendants fails to tender
an issue and/or otherwise admits the material allegation of the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the defendants have made partial
payments of their obligation and are, thereof, entitled to be credited <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is a matter which is not so material as to
necessitate the tedious process of going into trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state that from the records,
the plaintiff has not disputed said partial payments allegedly made to it by
the defendants such that the same may be conceded in favor of the latter."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In resolving the special
civil action for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>, the Court of Appeals
limited itself to the question of whether or not the petitioners perfected
their appeal on time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It ruled </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Decisive here is the question of whether petitioners perfected
their appeal on time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For if not, the
other points raised - whether the court committed a grave abuse of discretion
in issuing the writ of attachment and refusing to act on petitioners' motion to
dissolve the same - become, so to speak, so much, 'water under the bridge'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of his allegation that his law
office received the copy of the decision on October 27, 1976, not on October
26th, petitioners' counsel submitted an affidavit of his office-clerk, Ruby <span class="SpellE">Ariola</span>, wherein the latter states that he received the
registered mail containing the copy of the decision on that date, October 27,
1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And in apparent attempt to bolster
<span class="SpellE">Ariola's</span> claim, he (counsel) called the court's
attention to the Record Book of the Postmaster of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
City (Annex 'AA'; Petition; Annex 'B', Answer to the Petition) observing that
from the naked eye 'the number '6' <u>appears</u> to be not only re-written but
also heavily indented and appear­ing to cover 'the number '7', the top portion

only irresponsible and reckless but one characterized by malice and bad faith,

counsel for respondent <span class="SpellE">Vimarco</span>, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said insinuation of tampering is a desperate
effort on the part of counsel for Petitioners to gain one more day to preserve
their right to appeal, which had been lost through their own inexcusable
neglect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That a copy of the decision dated
October 13, 1976 was received by Petitioners through their counsel on October
26, 1976 and not on October 27, 1976 as they would like this Court to believe,
is clearly shown by the following:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">"a.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The certification of the Postmaster of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City dated December 7, 1976 and hereto attached and

counsel a copy of the decision of the Court dated October 13, 1976 on October
26, 1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 5 of Rule 131 of
