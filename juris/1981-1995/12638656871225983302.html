<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 77638, Maritime pleads non-liability on the ground
that it was only the <span class="SpellE">charterer's</span> agent and should not
answer for whatever responsibility might have attached to the principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also argues that the respondent court
erred in applying Articles 1734 and 1735 of the Civil Code in determining the <span class="SpellE">charterer's</span> liability.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">A </span>demise</span>
<span style="">involves the transfer </span>of full
possession and control of the <span style="">vessel </span>for
the period covered by the contract, the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
obtaining the right to use the vessel and <span style="">carry whatever cargo it chooses, while manning </span>and supplying the

<p class="BODY">A voyage charter is a contract for the hire of a vessel for one
or a <span style="">series of voyages </span>usually
for the purpose of transporting goods for the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voyage charter <span style="">is a contract of <span class="SpellE">affreightment</span> </span>and <span style="">is considered a private carriage.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Tested by <span style="">those
definitions, the agreement entered </span>into in the cases at <span style="">bar should be considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This brings us to the basic question
of who, in this kind of charter, shall be liable for the cargo.</p>

<p class="BODY">A voyage charter <span style="">being </span>a
private carriage, the parties may freely contract respecting liability for
damage to the goods and other matters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basic principle is that "the responsibility for cargo loss
falls on the one who agreed to perform the duty involved" in accordance with
the terms of most voyage charters.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is true in the present cases where the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
was responsible for loading, stowage and discharging at the ports visited,
while the owner was responsible for the care of the cargo during the
voyage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Par. 2 of the Uniform
General Charter read:</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Owners are to be
responsible for loss of or damage to the goods or for delay in delivery of the
goods only in case the loss, damage or delay has been caused by the improper or
negligent stowage of the goods or by personal want of due diligence on the part
of the Owners or their Manager to make the vessel in all respects seaworthy and
to secure that she is properly manned, equipped and supplied or by the personal
act or default of the Owners or their Manager.</blockquote>

<blockquote>And the Owners are responsible for no loss or damage or delay
arising from any other cause whatsoever, even from the neglect or default of
the Captain or crew or some other person employed by the Owners onboard or
ashore for whose acts they would, but for this clause, be responsible, or from <span class="SpellE">unseaworthiness</span> of the vessel on loading or <span class="GramE">commencement</span> of the voyage or at any time whatsoever.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Damage caused by contact with or leakage, smell or evaporation from
other goods or by the inflammable or explosive nature or insufficient package
of other goods not to be considered as caused by improper or negligent stowage,
even if in fact so caused.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">while</span> Clause 17
of Additional Clauses to <span class="SpellE">Charterparty</span> provided:</p>

<blockquote>The cargo shall be loaded, stowed and<span style=""> </span>discharged free of expense to the vessel under the Master's
supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if required at
loading and discharging ports the vessel is to give free use of winches and
power to drive them gear, runners and ropes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also slings, as on board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shore <span class="SpellE">winchmen</span> are to be employed and they are to be for <span class="SpellE">Charterers</span>' or Shippers' or Receivers' account <span style="">as </span>the case may be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vessel is also to give free use of sufficient
light, <span style="">as </span>on board, if required
for night <span style="">work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time lost through breakdown of winches or
derricks is not to count as <span class="SpellE">laytime</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Home Insurance Co. v. American Steamship Agencies, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
the trial court rejected similar stipulations as contrary to public policy and,
applying the provisions of the Civil Code on common carriers and of the Code of
Commerce on the duties of the ship captain, held the vessel liable in damages
for loss of part of the cargo it was carrying.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court reversed, declaring <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>The provisions of our Civil Code on common carriers were taken from
Anglo-American law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under American
jurisprudence, a common carrier undertaking to carry a special cargo or
chartered to <span style="">a </span>special person
only, becomes <span style="">a </span>private
carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a </span>private carrier, a stipulation exempting the owner from
liability for the negligence of its agent is not against public policy, and is
deemed valid.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Such doctrine we find reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Civil Code provisions on common carriers should not be applied where
the carrier is not acting as such but <span style="">as
a </span>private carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
stipulation in the charter party absolving the owner from liability for loss
due to the negligence of its agent would be void only if the strict public
policy governing common carriers is applied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such policy has no force where the public at large is not involved, as
in the case of a ship totally chartered for the use of a single party.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, this ruling cannot benefit <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Hongkong</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> because there was
no showing in that case that the vessel was at fault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cases at bar, the trial court found
that 1,383 bags were <span class="SpellE">shortlanded</span>, which could only
mean that they were damaged or lost on board the vessel before unloading of the
shipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied that the
entire cargo shipped by the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> in <st1:city><st1:place>Odessa</st1:place></st1:city>
was covered by a clean bill of lading.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
As the bags were in good order when received in the vessel, the presumption is
that they were damaged or lost during the voyage as a result of their negligent
or improper stowage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this the ship
owner should be held liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">But we do agree that the period for filing the claim is one year,
in accordance with the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was adopted and embodied by our
legislature in Com. Act No. 65 which, as <span style="">a </span>special law, prevails over the general
provisions of the Civil Code on prescription of actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3(6) of that Act provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>In any event, the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all
liability in respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year
after delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been
delivered; Provided, that if a notice of loss for damage; either apparent or
concealed, is not given as provided for in this section, that fact shall not
effect or prejudice the right of the shipper to bring suit within one year
after the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been
delivered.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This period was applied by the Court in the case of Union
Carbide, Philippines, Inc. v. Manila Railroad Co.,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was <span style="">held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Under the facts of this case, we held that the one-year period was
correctly reckoned by the trial court from December 19, 1961, when, <span style="">as </span>agreed upon by the parties and as
shown in the tally sheets, the cargo was discharged from the carrying vessel
and delivered to the Manila Port Service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That one-year period expired on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="12">December
 19, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the
action was filed on <st1:date year="1962" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1962</st1:date>,
it was barred by the statute of limitations.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The one-year period in the cases at bar should commence on <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1979</st1:date>, when the last item
was delivered to the consignee.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
<st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s complaint was filed against <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
on <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1980</st1:date>, but
tardily against <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> on <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The consequence is that the action is considered prescribed as far <span style="">as </span><span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> is concerned but not against its principal, which
is what matters anyway.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the goods damaged or lost during unloading, the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
having assumed this activity under the charter party "free of expense to
the vessel." The difficulty is that Transcontinental has not been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in these cases and so is beyond our
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liability imposable
upon it cannot be borne by Maritime which, as a mere agent, is not answerable
for injury caused by its principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is <span style="">a </span>well-settled
<span style="">principle </span>that
the agent shall be liable for the act or omission of the principal only if the
latter is undisclosed.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:place>Union</st1:place> seeks to hold Maritime liable as
ship agent on the basis of the ruling of this Court in the case of Switzerland
General Insurance Co., Ltd. v. Ramirez.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
However, we do not find that that case is applicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that case, the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> represented
itself on the face of the bill of lading as the carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vessel owner and the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
did not stipulate <span style="">in </span>the <span class="SpellE">Charterparty</span> on their separate respective liabilities for
the cargo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loss/damage to the cargo
was sustained while it was still on board or under the custody of the
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
was itself the carrier, it was made liable for the acts of the ship captain who
was responsible for the cargo while under the custody of the vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the <span class="SpellE">charterer's</span> agent, the
evidence showed that it represented the vessel when it took charge of the
unloading of the cargo and issued cargo receipts (or tally sheets) in its own
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claims against the vessel for the
losses/damages sustained by that cargo were also received and processed by
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the <span class="SpellE">charterer's</span>
agent was also considered a ship agent and so was held to be <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with its principal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts in the cases at bar are different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> did
not represent <span class="GramE">itself</span> as a carrier and indeed assumed
responsibility only for the unloading of the cargo, i.e., after the goods were
already outside the custody of the vessel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In supervising the unloading of the <span style="">cargo and issuing Daily Operations Report </span>and Statement of Facts
indicating and describing the day-to-day discharge of the cargo, Maritime acted
in representation of <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">charterer</span> and not of the vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus cannot be considered a ship
agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a mere <span class="SpellE">charterer's</span>
agent, it cannot be held <span class="SpellE"><span style="">solidarily</span></span><span style=""> liable
with Transcontinental for the losses/damages to the cargo outside the custody
of the </span>vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notably,
Transcontinental was disclosed as the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">charterer's</span></span><span style=""> principal and there is no question that
Maritime acted within the scope of its authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

their memorandum, where they discussed at length their position </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">vis-a-vis</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
claims of the other parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
we reiterate the rule that even if issues are not formally and specifically
raised on appeal, they may nevertheless be considered in the interest of
justice for </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">proper decision of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we have held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Besides, an unassigned error closely <span style="">related to the error properly assigned, or upon which the determination
of the question raised </span>by the error properly assigned is dependent, will
be considered by the appellate court notwithstanding the failure to assign it
as <span style="">error.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At any rate, the Court is clothed with ample authority to review
matters, even if they are not assigned as errors in their appeal, if it finds
that their consideration is necessary in arriving at <span style="">a </span>just decision of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

appellate court, may, in the interest of justice, be properly considered by
said court in deciding <span style="">a case, </span>if
they are questions raised in the trial court and are matters of record having
some bearing on the issue submitted which the parties failed to raise or the

<p class="BODY">In his decision dated <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="1">January
 4, 1984</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Artemon</span> de Luna of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila held:</p>

<blockquote>The Court, on the basis of the evidence, finds nothing to disprove
the finding of the marine and cargo surveyors that of the 66,390 bags of urea
fertilizer, 65,547 bags were "discharged ex-vessel" and there were
"<span class="SpellE">shortlanded</span>" "1,383 bags,"
valued at <span style="">P87<span class="GramE">,163.54</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sum should be the principal and primary
liability and responsibility of the </span>carrying vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the contract for the transportation of
goods, the vessel's <span style="">responsibility
commence upon the actual delivery to, and receipt by the carrier or its
authorized agent, until its final discharge at the port of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
Island Co., Ltd., as "<span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>" and
represented by </span><span style="">the defendant <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> &amp; Co., Inc., as its </span>local agent in the
Philippines, should be <span style="">responsible for
the value of the bags of urea fertilizer which were <span class="SpellE">shortlanded</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The remainder of the claim in the amount of P36<span class="GramE">,030.23</span>,
representing the value of the 574 bags of <span class="SpellE">unrecovered</span>
spillages having occurred after the shipment was discharged from the vessel
unto the ex-lighters as well as during the discharge from the lighters to the
truck which transported the shipment to the consignee's warehouses should be
for the account of the defendant Maritime Agencies &amp; Services, Inc.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the factual findings but must modify the legal
conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously discussed,
the liability of <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> can no longer be enforced
because the claim against it has prescribed; and as for Maritime, it cannot be
held liable for the acts of its known principal resulting in injury to <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interest <span style="">must </span>also be reduced to the legal rate of 6%, conformably to our
ruling in <span class="SpellE">Reformina</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tomol</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
