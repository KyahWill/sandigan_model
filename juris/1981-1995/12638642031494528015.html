<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in the latter part of 1981, the Management of the
Anglo-American Tobacco Corporation and the <span class="SpellE">Kapisanan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>
Anglo-American Tobacco Corporation (FOITAF) entered into a compromise agreement
whereby the company will pay to the union members the sum of P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for their claims arising from the unpaid emergency
cost of living allowance (ECOLA) and other benefits which were the subject of
their complaint before the Ministry of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> (<span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span>, for short) who is the union president received
the money which was paid in installments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he distributed the amount among the union members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vengco</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>,
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Wagas</span> and 80 others (<span class="SpellE">Vengco</span>,
et al., for short) who are union members noted that <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span>
was not authorized by the union workers to get the money; and that ten percent
(10%) of the P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> had been deducted to pay for
attorney's fees without their written authorization in violation of Article
242(o) of the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, they
demanded from <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> an accounting of how the P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was distributed to the members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> did not
give in to their demand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Vengco</span>, et al. filed a complaint with the Ministry of Labor
praying for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"(1) the expulsion of
Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> as president of the union for
violation of (the) union constitution and by-laws and the rights and conditions
of union members under the Labor Code; (2) an order to require <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> to render an accounting of how the P150,000.00
was distributed; and (3) an order to require private respondent to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">publish in the bulletin board the list </span>of
the members and the corresponding amount they each received from the
P150,000.00." <span class="GramE">(Memorandum for Petitioners, p. 150, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">).</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer with counterclaim, <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span>
alleged among others, that he was authorized by a resolution signed by the
majority of the union members to receive and distribute the P150,000.00 among
the workers; that the computation of the benefits was based on the payroll of
the company; that the ten percent (10%) attorneys' fees was in relation to the
claim of the local union for payment of emergency cost of living allowance
before the Ministry of Labor which is totally distinct and separate from the
negotiation of the CBA; and that the ten percent (10%) deduction was in
accordance with Section II, Rule No. VIII, Book No. 111 of the Rules and
Regulations implementing the Labor Code and therefore, no authorization from
the union members is required.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1982</st1:date>,

respondent Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations <span class="SpellE">Cresenciano</span>

granted and the Med-Arbiter's Order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="7">19 July 1982</st1:date> hereby set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, respondent Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> is hereby ordered to render a full accounting of
the One Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P150,000.00) he received from the
management of Anglo-American Tobacco Corporation in behalf of the members of

members and the respective amounts they have received, within ten (10) days
from receipt hereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, respondent
is hereby expelled as president of the <span class="SpellE">Kapisanan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> Associated Anglo American Tobacco Corporation

interposed by the respondent's counsel, Atty. Benjamin Sebastian is hereby
ordered dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">So decided."</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(p. </span>50, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> filed a motion for
reconsideration of the above-quoted decision while <span class="SpellE">Vengco</span>,
et al. filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their </span>opposition to
the said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1983</st1:date>,
Officer-in-Charge <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Calaycay</span>
issued an Order which held, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, premises considered, our resolution dated <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="12">29 December 1982</st1:date> is hereby set
aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, an audit examination of

<span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span>
Associated Anglo American Tobacco Corporation (FOITAF) is hereby ordered.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO RESOLVED."</span> (p. 62, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Vengco</span>, et al. sought reconsideration
of the aforementioned order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
contended that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the examination </span>of
the books of accounts of the union is irrelevant considering that the issue
involved in the case does not consist of union funds but back pay received by
the union members from the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, they pointed out that <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> did
not give the money to the union treasurer and consequently, the amount was not
entered in the records of the union.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1986</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Trajano</span> issued an order which affirmed the resolution
of <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1983</st1:date> and denied
the motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 58, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the present recourse by <span class="SpellE">Vengco</span>, et al.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in this case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> is guilty of illegally deducting 10% attorneys'
fees from petitioners’ <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>; and</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span> gravely abused his discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction in ordering examination of union books instead of affirming his
previous Order expelling <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> from the union and
ordering him to render an accounting of P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
received by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 151, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">)<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

that he already filed an accounting report on the P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
with the Bureau of Labor Relations which enumerated the names of the workers
and the corresponding amounts they received with their respective signatures
opposite their names, the sub-total of the amount of benefits received per

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>very clear
from the above-quoted provision that attorney's fees may not be deducted or
checked off from any amount due to an employee without his written consent
except for mandatory activities under the Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A mandatory activity has been defined as a judicial process of settling
dispute laid down by the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Carlos P. <span class="SpellE">Galvadores</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cresenciano</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span>, Director

entered into by the management and the union can not be considered as a
mandatory activity under the Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
true that the union filed a claim for emergency cost of living allowance and
other benefits before the Ministry of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But this case never reached its conclusion in view of the parties’
agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not also shown from the
records that Atty. Benjamin Sebastian was instrumental in forging the said
agreement on behalf of the union members.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> maintains that the "<span class="SpellE">Kapasiyahan</span>" gave him the authority to make the
deduction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This contention is
unfounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to his claim, the
undated "<span class="SpellE">Kapasiyahan</span>" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span>resolution did not confer upon him
the power to deduct 10% of the P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> despite the
alleged approval <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the majority
of the union workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the
said resolution (p. 75, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the same conclusion arrived at by <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span> who
declared it defective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We quote with
approval <span class="SpellE">Trajano's</span> findings on this point:</p>

<blockquote>"Further, a cursory examination of the alleged resolution
shows that it is quite defective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
only that it is not dated but also that, with the exception of the first page,
the remaining pages were not captioned and did not state the very purpose for
which it was prepared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the alleged
signatories were not properly apprised thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is, therefore, truth in complainant's contention that they never <span class="GramE">authorized,</span> more so, they had no knowledge of the deduction
of 10% attorney's fees until it was actually effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the deduction was not
valid." (p. 45, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Moreover, the law is explicit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It requires the individual written

bear the consequences of his acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
find that the penalty of expulsion from the union presidency imposed upon <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span> is justified.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that
the Orders dated <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1983</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1986</st1:date> were
issued with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The herein controversy involves the propriety of the 10% deduction from
the fringe benefits of the union workers which they received from the
management in settlement of their claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such issue does not touch on union dues or funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the sum of P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
was not entered into the records of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> since, as
earlier stated, the money was not turned over by <span class="SpellE">Timbungco</span>
to the Union Treasurer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
the said Orders have no basis.</p>
