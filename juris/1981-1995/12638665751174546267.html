				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two cases were consolidated because they have the same
objective:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the disqualification under
Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code of the private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Merito</span> Miguel, for the position of municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to which he
was elected in the local elections of January 18, 1988, on the ground that he
is a green card holder, hence:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a
permanent resident of the United States of America, not of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 84508 is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of
the decision dated January 13, 1988 of the COMELEC First Division, dismissing
the three (3) petitions of <span class="SpellE">Anecito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cascante</span> (SPC No. 87-551), <span class="SpellE">Cederico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Catabay</span> (SPC No. 87-595) and <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span>
C. Celeste (SPC No. 87-604), for the disqualification of <span class="SpellE">Merito</span>
C. Miguel, filed prior to the local elections on January 18, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 88831, Mateo <span class="SpellE">Caasi</span> vs. Court
of Appeals, et al., is a petition for review of the decision dated June 21,
1989, of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 14531 dismissing the petition
for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> filed by Mateo <span class="SpellE">Caasi</span>, a rival candidate for the position of municipal
mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
also to disqualify <span class="SpellE">Merito</span> Miguel on account of his
being a green card holder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to both petitions, Miguel admitted that he holds a
green card issued to him by the US Immigration Service, but he denied that he
is a permanent resident of the United States.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He allegedly obtained the green card for convenience in order that he
may freely enter the United States for his periodic medical examination and to
visit his children there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged
that he is a permanent resident of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pangasinan</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span>
he voted in all previous elections, including the plebiscite on February 2,
1987 for the ratification of the 1987 Constitution, and the congressional
elections on May 18, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-align: left;" align="left">After hearing the consolidated
petitions before it, the COMELEC, with the exception of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Badoy</span>, Jr., dismissed
the petitions on the ground that:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The possession of a green card by the respondent (Miguel)
does not sufficiently establish that he has abandoned his residence in the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On the
contrary, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> (sic) of his green card.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent has sufficiently indicated his
intention to continuously reside in <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span> as shown
by his having voted in successive elections in said municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the respondent meets the basic
requirements of citizenship and residence for candidates to elective local
officials (sic) as provided for in Section 42 of the Local Government Code,
there is no legal obstacle to his candidacy for mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>." <span class="GramE">(p. 12, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 84508.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his dissenting opinion, Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Badoy</span>,
Jr. opined that:</p>

<p class="2Q">"A green card holder being a permanent resident of or an
immigrant of a foreign country and respondent having admitted that he is a
green card holder, it is incumbent upon him, under Section 68 of the Omnibus
Election Code, to prove that he was ‘has waived his status as a permanent
resident or immigrant’ to be qualified to run for elected office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This respondent has not done." <span class="GramE">(p. 13, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 84508.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 88831, "Mateo <span class="SpellE">Caasi</span>,
petitioner vs. Court of Appeals and <span class="SpellE">Merito</span> Miguel,
respondents," the petitioner prays for a review of the decision dated June
21, 1989 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 14531 "<span class="SpellE">Merito</span> C. Miguel, petitioner vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>
R. Corpus, etc., respondents," reversing the decision of the Regional
Trial Court which denied Miguel's motion to dismiss the petition for <u>quo</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> filed by <span class="SpellE">Caasi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals ordered the regional
trial court to dismiss and desist from further proceeding in the <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals held:</p>

<p class="2Q">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it
is pointless for the Regional Trial Court to hear the case questioning the
qualification of the petitioner as resident of the Philippines, after the
COMELEC has ruled that the petitioner meets the very basic requirements of
citizenship and residence for candidates to elective local officials (sic) and
that there is no legal obstacles (sic) for the candidacy of the petitioner,
considering that decisions of the Regional Trial Courts on <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> cases under the Election Code are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the COMELEC." <span class="GramE">(p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 88831.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">These two cases pose the twin issues of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not a green card is proof that
the holder is a permanent resident of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, and (2) whether respondent Miguel
had waived his status as a permanent resident of or immigrant to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
prior to the local elections on <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 18, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution provides:</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">“Sec. 18.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Public officers and employees owe the State and this Constitution
allegiance at all times, and any public officer or employee who seeks to change

<p class="BODY">In the same vein, but not quite, Section 68 of the Omnibus
Election Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 881) provides:</p>

the election laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Sec.
25, 1971, EC)."</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of current rumor that a good number of elective and
appointive public officials in the present administration of President Corazon
C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> are holders of green cards in foreign
countries, their effect on the holders’ right to hold elective public office in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is a question that excites much interest in the outcome of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Merito</span> Miguel, the Court
deems it significant that in the "Application for <u>Immigrant</u> Visa
and Alien Registration" (Optional Form No. 230, Department of State) which
Miguel filled up in his own handwriting and submitted to the US Embassy in
Manila before his departure for the United States in 1984, Miguel's answer to
Question No. 21 therein regarding his “Length of intended stay (if permanently,
so state).” Miguel's answer was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<u>Permanently</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On its face, the green card that was subsequently issued by the
United States Department of Justice and Immigration and Registration Service to
the respondent <span class="SpellE">Merito</span> C. Miguel identifies him in
clear bold letters as a RESIDENT ALIEN.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the back of the card, the upper portion the following information is
printed:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Alien Registration Receipt Card.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Person identified by
this card is entitled <u>to</u> <u>reside</u> <u>permanently</u> and work in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.”
<span class="GramE">(Annex A, pp. 189-190, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of
G.R. No. 84508.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Despite his vigorous disclaimer, Miguel's immigration to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 1984 constituted an abandonment of
his domicile and residence in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For he did not go to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> merely to visit his children or his
doctor there:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he entered the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> with the intention to live there
permanently as evidenced by his application for an immigrant’s (not a visitor's
or <span class="GramE">tourist's</span>) visa.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Based on that application of his, he was issued by the U.S. Government
the requisite green card or authority to reside there permanently.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Immigration is the removing into one place from another:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the act of immigrating; the entering into a
country with the intention of residing in it.</p>

<p class="2Q">"<u>An</u> <u>immigrant</u> is a person who removes into a
country for the purpose of <u>permanent</u> <u>residence</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As shown infra 84, however, statutes
sometimes give a broader meaning to the term ‘immigrant.’" <span class="GramE">(3 CJS 674.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a resident alien in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Miguel owes temporary and local allegiance to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the country in which he resides (3 CJS 527).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is in return for the protection given to him during the period of
his residence therein.</p>

<p class="2Q">“Aliens residing in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
while they are permitted to remain, are in general entitled to the protection
of the laws with regard to their rights of person and property and to their
civil and criminal responsibility.</p>

<p class="2Q">“In general, aliens residing in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, while they are permitted to remain,
are entitled to the safeguards of the constitution with regard to their rights
of person and property and to their civil and criminal responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus resident alien friends are entitled to
the benefit of the provision of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal
constitution that no state shall deprive ‘any person’ of life, liberty, or
property without due process of law, or deny to 'any person' the equal
protection of the law, and the protection of this amendment extends to the
right to earn a livelihood by following the ordinary occupations of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So an alien is entitled to the protection of
the provision of the Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution that no person
shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” (3
CJS 529-530.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 18, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution which provides
that "any public officer or employee who seeks to change his citizenship
or acquire the status of an immigrant of another country during his tenure shall
be dealt with by law" is not applicable to <span class="SpellE">Merito</span>
Miguel for he acquired the status of an immigrant of the United States <u>before</u>
he was elected to public office, not "during his tenure" as mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law applicable to him is Section 68 of the Omnibus Election
Code (B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 881), which provides:</p>

<p class="2Q">"<span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<p class="2Q">"Any person who is a permanent resident of or an immigrant to
a foreign country shall not be qualified to run for any elective office under
this Code unless such person has waived his status as permanent resident or
immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the residence requirement
provided for in the election laws."</p>

<p class="BODY">Did Miguel, by returning to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in November 1987 and presenting himself as a candidate for mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span> in the <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1988</st1:date> local elections, waive his status as a permanent resident
or immigrant of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>?</p>

<p class="BODY">To be "qualified to run for elective office" in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the law requires that the candidate who is a green card holder must have
"waived his status as a permanent resident or immigrant of a foreign
country." Therefore, his act of filing a certificate of candidacy for
elective office in the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">,</span> did not of itself constitute a waiver of his status as a
permanent resident or immigrant of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The waiver of his green card should be manifested by some act or acts
independent of and done prior to filing his candidacy for elective office in
this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without such prior waiver,
he was "disqualified to run for any elective office" (Sec. 68,
Omnibus Election Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Merito</span> Miguel admits that he
holds a green card, which proves that he is a permanent resident or immigrant
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but the records of this case are starkly bare of proof that he had waived his
status as such <u>before</u> he ran for election as municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span> on <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="1">January
 18, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We, therefore,
hold that he was disqualified to become a candidate for that office.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code is not
hard to find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Residence in the
municipality where he intends to run for elective office for at least one (1)
year at the time of filing his certificate of <span class="GramE">candidacy,</span>
is one of the qualifications that a candidate for elective public office must
possess (Sec. 42, Chap. 1, Title 2, Local Government Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miguel did not possess that qualification
because he was a permanent resident of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and he resided in <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span>
for a period of only three (3) months (not one year) after his return to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in November 1987 and before he ran for mayor of that municipality on <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In banning from elective public office Philippine citizens who
are permanent residents or immigrants of a foreign country, the Omnibus
Election Code has laid down a clear policy of excluding from the right to hold
elective public office those Philippine citizens who possess dual loyalties and
allegiance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law has reserved that
privilege for its citizens who have cast their lot with our country "without
mental reservations or purpose of evasion." The assumption is that those
who are resident aliens of a foreign country are incapable of such entire
devotion to the interest and welfare of their homeland for with one eye on
their public duties here, they must keep another eye on their duties under the
laws of the foreign country of their choice in order to preserve their status
as permanent residents thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Miguel insists that even though he applied for immigration and
permanent residence in the United States, he never really intended to live
there permanently, for all that he wanted was a green card to enable him to
come and go to the U.S. with ease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, he would have this Court believe that he applied for immigration
to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under false pretenses; that all this time he only had one foot in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> but kept his other foot in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if that were true, this Court will not
allow itself to be a party to his duplicity by permitting him to benefit from
it, and giving him the best of both worlds so to speak.</p>

<p class="BODY">Miguel's application for immigrant status and permanent residence
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
his possession of a green card attesting to such status are conclusive proof
that he is a permanent resident of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
despite his occasional visits to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The waiver of such immigrant status should be
as indubitable as his application for it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Absent clear evidence that he made an irrevocable waiver of that status
or that he surrendered his green card to the appropriate <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
authorities before he ran for mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bolinao</span> in the
local elections on <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1988</st1:date>,
our conclusion is that he was disqualified to run for said public office,
hence, his election thereto was null and void.</p>
