				<H3>COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, PETITIONER, VS. JOHN GOTAMCO & SONS, INC. AND THE COURT OF TAX APPEALS, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>YAP, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">The question involved in this petition is whether respondent 
John Gotamco &amp; Sons, Inc. should pay the 3% contractor's tax under Section 
191 of the National Internal Revenue Code on the gross receipts it realized from 
the construction of the World Health Organization office building in 
Manila.<br><br>The World Health Organization (WHO for short) is an international 
organization which has a regional office in Manila.&nbsp; As an international 
organization, it enjoys privileges and immunities which are defined more 
specifically in the Host Agreement entered into between the Republic of the 
Philippines and the said Organization on July 22, 1951.&nbsp; Section 11 of that 
Agreement provides, <em>inter alia</em>, that "the Organization, its assets, 
income and other properties shall be:&nbsp; (a) exempt from all direct and indirect 
taxes.&nbsp; It is understood, however, that the Organization will not claim 
exemption from taxes which are, in fact, no more than charges for public utility 
services; . . ."<br><br>When the WHO decided to construct a building to house 
its own offices, as well as the other United Nations offices stationed in 
Manila, it entered into a further agreement with the Government of the Republic 
of the Philippines on November 26, 1957.&nbsp; This agreement contained the following 
provision (Article III, paragraph 2):</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The Organization may import into the country materials and 
fixtures required for the construction free from all duties and taxes and agrees 
not to utilize any portion of the international reserves of the 
Government."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Article VIII of the above-mentioned agreement referred to the 
Host Agreement concluded on July 22, 1951 which granted the Organization 
exemption from all direct and indirect taxes.<br><br>In inviting bids for the 
construction of the building, the WHO informed the bidders that the building to 
be constructed belonged to an international organization with diplomatic status 
and thus exempt from the payment of all fees, licenses, and taxes, and that 
therefore their bids "must take this into account and should not include items 
for such taxes, licenses and other payments to Government agencies".<br><br>The 
construction contract was awarded to respondent John Gotamco &amp; Sons, Inc. 
(Gotamco for short) on February 10, 1958 for the stipulated price of 
P370,000.00, but when the building was completed the price reached a total of 
P452,544.00.<br><br>Sometime in May 1958, the WHO received an opinion from the 
Commissioner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue stating that "as the 3% 
contractor's tax is an indirect tax on the assets and income of the 
Organization, the gross receipts derived by contractors from their contracts 
with the WHO for the construction of its new building, are exempt from tax in 
accordance with . . . the Host Agreement".&nbsp; Subsequently, however, on June 3, 
1958, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue reversed his opinion and stated that 
"as the 3% contractor's tax is not a direct nor an indirect tax on the WHO, but 
a tax that is primarily due from the contractor, the same is not covered by . . 
. the Host Agreement".<br><br>On January 2, 1960, the WHO issued a certification 
stating, <em>inter alia</em>,: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"When the request for bids for the construction of the World 
Health Organization office building was called for, contractors were informed 
that there would be no taxes or fees levied upon them for their work in 
connection with the construction of the building as this will be considered an 
indirect tax to the Organization caused by the increase of the contractor's bid 
in order to cover these taxes.&nbsp; This was upheld by the Bureau of Internal 
Revenue and it can be stated that the contractors submitted their bids in good 
faith with the exemption in mind.<br><br>The undersigned, therefore, certifies 
that the bid of John Gotamco &amp; Sons, made under the condition stated above, 
should be exempted from any taxes in connection with the construction of the 
World Health Organization office building." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On January 17, 1961, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue sent 
a letter of demand to Gotamco demanding payment of P16,970.40, representing the 
3% contractor's tax plus surcharges on the gross receipts it received from the 
WHO in the construction of the latter's building.<br><br>Respondent Gotamco 
appealed the Commissioner's decision to the Court of Tax Appeals, which after 
trial rendered a decision in favor of Gotamco and reversed the Commissioner's 
decision.&nbsp; The Court of Tax Appeal's decision is now before us for review on 
<em>certiorari</em>.<br><br>In his first assignment of error, petitioner 
questions the entitlement of the WHO to tax exemption, contending that the Host 
Agreement is null and void, not having been ratified by the Philippine Senate as 
required by the Constitution.&nbsp; We find no merit in this contention.&nbsp; While 
treaties are required to be ratified by the Senate under the Constitution, less 
formal types of international agreements may be entered into by the Chief 
Executive and become binding without the concurrence of the legislative 
body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Host Agreement comes within 
the latter category; it is a valid and binding international agreement even 
without the concurrence of the Philippine Senate.&nbsp; The privileges and immunities 
granted to the WHO under the Host Agreement have been recognized by this Court 
as legally binding on Philippine authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Petitioner maintains that even 
assuming that the Host Agreement granting tax exemption to the WHO is valid and 
enforceable, the 3% contractor's tax assessed on Gotamco is not an "indirect 
tax" within its purview.&nbsp; Petitioner's position is that the contractor's tax "is 
in the nature of an excise tax which is a charge imposed upon the performance of 
an act, the enjoyment of a privilege or the engaging in an occupation . . . It 
is a tax due primarily and directly on the contractor, not on the owner of the 
building.&nbsp; Since this tax has no bearing upon the WHO, it cannot be deemed an 
indirect taxation upon it."<br><br>We agree with the Court of Tax Appeals in 
rejecting this contention of the petitioner.&nbsp; Said the respondent court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In context, direct taxes are those that are demanded from the 
very person who, it is intended or desired, should pay them; while indirect 
taxes are those that are demanded in the first instance from one person in the 
expectation and intention that he can shift the burden to someone else.&nbsp; 
(<em>Pollock vs. Farmers, L &amp; T Co., </em>1957 US 429, 15 S. Ct. 673, 39 
Law. Ed. 759.) The contractor's tax is of course payable by the contractor but 
in the last analysis it is the owner of the building that shoulders the burden 
of the tax because the same is shifted by the contractor to the owner as a 
matter of self-preservation.&nbsp; Thus, it is an indirect tax.&nbsp; And it is an 
indirect tax on the WHO because, although it is payable by the petitioner, the 
latter can shift its burden on the WHO.&nbsp; In the last analysis it is the WHO that 
will pay the tax indirectly through the contractor and it certainly cannot be 
said that 'this tax has no bearing upon the World Health Organization'." 
</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Petitioner claims that under the authority of the 
<em>Philippine Acetylene Company versus Commissioner of Internal Revenue, et 
al.</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the 3% contractor's tax 
falls directly on Gotamco and cannot be shifted to the WHO.&nbsp; The Court of Tax 
Appeals, however, held that the said case is not controlling in this case, since 
the Host Agreement specifically exempts the WHO from "indirect taxes".&nbsp; We 
agree.&nbsp; The <em>Philippine Acetylene</em> case involved a tax on sales of goods 
which under the law had to be paid by the manufacturer or producer; the fact 
that the manufacturer or producer might have added the amount of the tax to the 
price of the goods did not make the sales tax "a tax on the purchaser".&nbsp; The 
Court held that the sales tax must be paid by the manufacturer or producer even 
if the sale is made to tax-exempt entities like the National Power Corporation, 
an agency of the Philippine Government, and to the Voice of America, an agency 
of the United States Government.<br><br>The Host Agreement, in specifically 
exempting the WHO from "indirect taxes", contemplates taxes which, although not 
imposed upon or paid by the Organization directly, form part of the price paid 
or to be paid by it.&nbsp; This is made clear in Section 12 of the Host Agreement 
which provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"While the Organization will not, as a general rule, in the 
case of minor purchases, claim exemption from excise duties, and from taxes on 
the sale of movable and immovable property which form part of the price to be 
paid, nevertheless, when the Organization is making <em>important purchases</em> 
for official use of property on which such duties and taxes have been charged or 
are chargeable the Government of the Republic of the Philippines shall make 
appropriate administrative arrangements for <em>the remission or return of the 
amount of duty or tax."</em> (Emphasis supplied). </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The above-quoted provision, although referring only to 
purchases made by the WHO, elucidates the clear intention of the Agreement to 
exempt the WHO from "indirect" taxation.<br><br>The certification issued by the 
WHO, dated January 20, 1960, sought exemption of the contractor, Gotamco, from 
any taxes in connection with the construction of the WHO office building.&nbsp; The 
3% contractor's tax would be within this category and should be viewed as a form 
of an "indirect tax" on the Organization, as the payment thereof or its 
inclusion in the bid price would have meant an increase in the construction cost 
of the building.<br><br>Accordingly, finding no reversible error committed by 
the respondent Court of Tax Appeals, the appealed decision is hereby 
affirmed.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.</p>
