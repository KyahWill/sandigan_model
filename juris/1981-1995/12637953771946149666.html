				<BR><STRONG>FERNAN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review on <i>certiorari</i> the decision of
the Secretary of Labor dated January 15, 1975 which sustained the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> decision and ordered private respondent Pacific
Mills, Inc. to pay Juan <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span> the sum of
P2,340.00 as separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Juan <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span> was employed by
respondent Company on <st1:date year="1960" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1960</st1:date>
as its general production overseer with a basic monthly pay of P360.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="8">August
 10, 1973</st1:date>, respondent Company filed with the Department of Labor an
application for clearance to terminate the services of <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span>
on the grounds of falsification of company records, smoking inside prohibited
area, dereliction of duty and inefficiency resulting in loss of
confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, he was
placed under preventive suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being a member of petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place> [as
well as the Pacific Mills, Inc. Supervisors' <st1:place>Union</st1:place>],<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
said petitioner took up the cudgels for <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span> and
opposed respondent Company's application.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1973</st1:date>,
respondent Company lifted the preventive suspension of <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span>
and allowed him to report back for work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He did but only for one day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From
<st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="8">August 22 to 30, 1973</st1:date>, he
was absent without leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Company considered such action as tantamount to abandonment, for which reason
it issued a memorandum on <st1:date year="1973" day="31" month="8">August 31,
 1973</st1:date> placing <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span> back on
suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, acting on respondent Company's application for
clearance, the compulsory arbitrator found that <span class="SpellE">Tamondong's</span>
suspension was illegal for being in violation of Presidential Decree No. 21 and
its Implementing Instructions, as well as of Republic Act No. 1052 [Termination
Pay Law].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, he ordered
respondent Company to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span> with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> up to the date of actual reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Company appealed to the National Labor Relations
Commission [NLRC].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said tribunal found
that during the hearings on the case, respondent Company failed to prove the
grounds adduced to justify the removal of <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span>
and concluded that said employee was dismissed without just cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being no proof that the mandatory
advance notice of termination was ever served on <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span>
within the statutory time frame, respondent Company was held liable for
separation pay in the amount of P2,340.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s appeal to the Secretary
of Labor, the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> grant of termination pay to <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span>, instead of reinstatement, was sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place> then
came directly to this Court contending that the adverse rulings of the NLRC and
the Secretary of Labor are contrary to the Labor Code and the constitutional
guarantee on security of tenure, and that the Termination Pay Law is no longer
applicable in view of the new Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing the instant petition for review, we find decisive
the fact that at the time of <span class="SpellE">Tamondong's</span>
re-suspension on <st1:date year="1973" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1973</st1:date>,
which amounted to a constructive separation from work, the applicable law on
dismissals was the Termination Pay Law [Republic Act No. 1052, as
amended].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said statute was deemed
repealed only on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1974</st1:date>
when Presidential Decree No. 442, otherwise known as the Labor Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
took effect.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provision of the Termination Pay Law states:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.-In cases of employment without a definite period,
in a commercial, industrial, or agricultural establishment or enterprise, the
employer or the employee may terminate at any time the employment with just
cause; or without just cause in the case of an employee by serving written
notice on the employer at least one month in advance, or in the case of an
employer, by serving such notice to the employee at least one month in advance
or one-half month for every year of service of the employee, whichever is
longer, a fraction of at least six months being considered as one whole year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The employer, upon whom no such notice was served in case of
termination of employment without just cause may hold the employee liable for
damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The employee, upon whom no such notice was served in case of
termination of employment without just cause shall be entitled to compensation
from the date of termination of his employment in an amount equivalent to his
salaries or wages corresponding to the required period of notice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted provision has been consistently construed by
this Court as granting to the employer the right to terminate the employment of
an employee with or without just cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only condition imposed was that if the dismissal is without just
cause, the employer should serve notice on the employee at least one month in
advance or one-half month for every year of service of the employee, whichever
is longer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the failure to serve
such notice that rendered the employer liable for separation pay and not the
fact that the employment was severed without just cause.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It has also been held that under the Termination Pay Law, even if
the manner of the employee's dismissal has been found to be without just cause,
without due notice, and abusive on the part of the employer, said employer may
only be liable for separation pay and moral damages, and the dismissed employee
cannot demand reinstatement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the case at bar, it becomes unnecessary for Us to
determine whether or not <span class="SpellE">Tamondong's</span> dismissal was
for cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, reinstatement is
out of the question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only issue is
whether or not <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span> was served with the notice
required by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC found that he
has not been so served, which finding is deemed admitted by the respondent
company in failing to appeal from the decision of the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, instead of reinstatement, the award of
separation pay to <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span> corresponding to one-half
month pay for every year of service (P180.00 x 13 years of service), for having
been dismissed without the required advance notice, was, at that time,
consistent with the prevailing laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the records show that petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
failed to exhaust the available administrative remedies provided for in Article
222 of the Labor Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
From the <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1975</st1:date>
decision of the Secretary of Labor, petitioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
should have appealed to the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, it elevated its case to this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule in our jurisdiction is that when an
administrative remedy is provided by law, relief must be sought by first
exhausting that remedy before seeking judicial intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure to do so is fatal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby DENIED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The questioned decisions of the Secretary of
Labor and the NLRC are affirmed, with costs against the petitioner.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
