<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:598.5pt">In August 1992, private respondent
Rodolfo Lasay (hereinafter LASAY), the incumbent barangay captain of barangay
Gimaloto of the municipality of Sorsogon and an aspirant for the position of
president of the ABC of the said municipality, filed with the court <i>a </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">quo</span></i> against the public respondent
SB of Sorsogon a petition for declaratory relief and injunction with a prayer
for the issuance of a temporary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">restraining
</span>order. LASAY sought the determination by the court of the “appropriate,
proper interpretation of the Provision of Sec. 494 of Republic Act No. 7160”
and of “whether or not the President of the Association of Barangay Captains
can continue holding office despite the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">termination
of the Terms of Office of the </span><i>Sangguniang Bayan</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> of </span>Sorsogon on June 30, 1992.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

He posited the theory that the term of office of GALAROSA as an <i>ex officio</i>
member of the SB of Sorsogon is coterminous with that of the said SB which
expired of 30 June 1992; hence, there was a need for the new election of an ABC
representative. He further alleged that during its session, the SB of Sorsogon
accepted and recognized the participation of GALAROSA over his (LASAY’s)
protest allegedly on the basis of the memorandum of the Department of Interior
and Local Government (DILG) allowing the ABC presidents elected before 30 June
1992 to continue in office until the election of new ones. LASAY then prayed
for the issuance of a temporary restraining order enjoining the SB of Sorsogon
from recognizing GALAROSA as an <i>ex officio</i> member thereof and from
allowing him to participate in its deliberations, for the holding in abeyance
of GALAROSA’S salaries, and, after hearing, for a judgment “embodying the
literal interpretation of Sec. 494 of the New Local Government Code to the
effect that the term of office of the <i>ex officio</i> membership to the <i>Sangguniang
Bayan</i> of the President of [the] ABC should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>no case be beyond the term of office of said <i>Sangguniang
Bayan</i>.” The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 5755.</p>

Provincial Prosecutor, asked for the dismissal of the petition because (a)
LASAY “has no legal right to file the” petition or the petition “is based on
pure speculative rights,” and (b) the petition is premature since the
resolution of the issues raised may still be the subject of rules and
regulations to implement Section 494 of the Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 September 1992, the trial court, per respondent Judge
Eudarlio B. Valencia, issued a temporary restraining order directing the SB of
Sorsogon “to desist from recognizing the participation of the old <i>Ex Officio</i>

in abeyance the taking and/or payment of salaries from the Municipal Government
of Sorsogon relative thereto.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> It

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in the light of all the foregoing considerations,
judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-indent:-.25in">(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Declaring the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">incumbent </span>President of the Association of Barangay Captains of
Sorsogon as without any further right or legal basis to continue in office as
ex-officio member of the present Sangguniang Bayan of Sorsogon pursuant to and
conformably with Section 494 of Republic Act No. 7160; and</p>

Sorsogon to cease and desist from recognizing the participation of the old
ex-officio membership of the President of the Association of Barangay Captains
of the town of Sorsogon.”</p>

<p class="BODY">In holding for LASAY, the respondent Judge rejected the claims of
the SB of Sorsogon that (1) pursuant to DILG Memorandum Circular No. 92-38 dated
29 June 1992, Section 494 of the Local Government Code was reconciled with
Article 210(d)(3), Rule XXIX of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the said
Code which provides that incumbent ABC presidents shall continue to serve as <i>ex
officio</i> members of their respective <i>sanggunians</i> unless sooner
removed for cause or the new officers shall have been elected and qualified;
(2) LASAY is not the proper party in interest and even if he is, he did not
exhaust all available administrative remedies; and (3) what is involved is a
political question which is beyond the province of the trial court. As to the
first, the respondent Judge ruled that Article 210 of the Rules and Regulations
does not expressly provide that the term of office of the ABC presidents as <i>ex
officio</i> members of the SB shall go beyond the term of the SB concerned;
since the term of the <i>sanggunian</i> concerned expired on 30 June 1992, it
stands to follow that the <i>ex officio</i> membership of the <i>liga</i>
president in the said <i>sanggunian</i>, by express mandate of law, likewise
ended on the said date. As to the exhaustion of administrative remedies, the
respondent Judge ruled that it is not applicable since the issue involved is
“purely a legal one.” He rejected the “political question” issue by stating
that the interpretation of laws, rules, and regulations is a judicial function
and prerogative. Furthermore, he invoked Section 1, Article VIII of the 1987
Constitution on the scope of judicial review. The respondent Judge did not
squarely tackle the issue regarding the <i>locus standi</i> of LASAY, although
he described LASAY as “the incumbent Barangay Captain of Gimaloto ... a
declared aspirant for President of the [ABC] ... as well as being a taxpayer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">claiming direct interest to complain, protest
and seek the proper relief.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to accept the decision, GALAROSA filed this petition which
we have decided to treat as one for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65.  He submits therein that:</p>

<p class="2Q">“THE RESPONDENT JUDGE ERRED WHEN HE RULED THAT THE PETITIONER,
DESPITE HIS INCUMBENCY AS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF BARANGAY
COUNCILS OF THE MUNICIPALITY OF SORSOGON, HAS NO LONGER ANY LEGAL BASIS OR
RIGHT TO HIS <i>EX-OFFICIO</i> MEMBERSHIP IN THE SANGGUNIANG BAYAN OF THE
MUNICIPALITY OF SORSOGON.”</p>

<p class="BODY">We required the respondents to comment on the petition, and on 3
June 1993 we issued a temporary restraining order directing the respondent
Judge to cease and desist from implementing and effecting the challenged
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment, LASAY states that GALAROSA, not being a party to
the case before the trial court, has no right to file the instant petition.
LASAY argues that although GALAROSA had filed a motion for intervention, that
pleading was not acted upon by the trial court. As to the merits of the
petition, he asks that we sustain the challenged decision because it is in
accord with existing jurisprudence and the principles of statutory
construction; he also avers that Memorandum Circular No. 92-38 of the DILG,
which is relied upon by GALAROSA, violates and contravenes the clear mandate of
Section 494 of the Code which provides that in no case shall the membership of
the <i>ex officio</i> members of the SB extend beyond the term of the SB
concerned, which ended on 30 June 1992. GALAROSA filed a Reply to this Comment
to which LASAY filed a Rejoinder. Not to be outdone, the former filed a
Sur-rejoinder.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 July 1993, the Office of the Solicitor General filed its
comment. While not explicitly saying so, it asks us to grant the petition and
to set aside the challenged decision because the respondent Judge should have
dismissed the action on the following grounds:  (a) LASAY failed to present a justiciable controversy since he is not an
ABC president but a mere aspirant thereto, or, elsewise stated, his right to an
<i>ex officio</i> membership in the SB is purely anticipatory; (b) not being an
ABC president, LASAY is not a proper party to assail the <i>ex officio</i>
membership of GALAROSA; and (c) the latter, who was to be directly affected by
the petition of LASAY, was not named a party-respondent; in view of this
“non-joinder of proper part[y],” respondent Judge should have dismissed the
petition outright pursuant to Section 5, Rule 64 of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We resolved to give due course to the petition and required the
parties to submit their respective memoranda, which they subsequently complied
with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before proceeding to the main issue, we will address some
collateral issues which the parties have raised, to wit: (a) the legal
personality of LASAY to file the petition for declaratory relief and injunction
with the trial court, (b) the absence of a justiciable controversy, (c) the
non-joinder of an indispensable party in the said petition, and (d) the
precipitateness of the trial court’s decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stressed that the petition filed by LASAY with the
trial court is one for declaratory relief and injunction and not solely for the
former. The latter can be either prohibitory or mandatory in character. LASAY
sought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>enjoin the SB of
Sorsogon from recognizing GALAROSA as an <i>ex officio</i> member of the SB and
from allowing him to participate in its deliberations, and to direct it to hold
in abeyance the payment of GALAROSA’s salaries. LASAY brought the action in his
capacity as a barangay captain who is seeking the presidency of the ABC of
Sorsogon and in his capacity as a taxpayer. This Court agrees with GALAROSA and
the Office of the Solicitor General that with respect to the first, LASAY does
not have the legal standing to institute the action for he is a mere aspirant
to the presidency of the ABC and his right thereto is a mere expectancy. We do
rule, however, that as a taxpayer he has a sufficient legal standing, because
the injunction he prayed for is founded on what he believed to be an illegal
disbursement of public funds of his municipal government. In this jurisdiction,
the strict rule relative to the determination of real parties in interest has
been sufficiently relaxed to allow a taxpayer to bring an action to restrain
the unlawful disbursement of public funds.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We also hold that the requisites for an action for declaratory
relief were present, namely: (a) that there is a justiciable controversy, (b)
that the controversy is between persons whose interests are adverse, (c) that
the party seeking the relief has a legal interest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>the controversy, and (d) that the issue invoked is ripe for
judicial determination.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">controversy is whether GALAROSA can continue
to serve as a member of the SB after 30 June 1992. LASAY, as a taxpayer, has
the </span><i>locus </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">standi</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> to have it resolved because a decision
against GALAROSA would mean that he is not entitled to receive his salary and
other benefits as a member of the SB and any such payment to him beyond 30 June
1992 would</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, the form and nature of the action filed by LASAY
required the inclusion of GALAROSA as an adverse party. It is his right to his
office that is challenged and he is the person who would be directly affected
by any decision therein. No <u>final</u> determination of an action can be had
unless he is joined therein. He is, therefore, an indispensable party. Under
Section 7, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules of Court, the joinder of indispensable
parties is <u>compulsory</u>; consequently, no action can proceed unless they
are joined.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The absence of an indispensable party in a case renders ineffectual all the
proceedings subsequent to the filing of the complaint including the judgment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
LASAY should have been required to implead GALAROSA and should he fail to do
so, the petition should be dismissed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
GALAROSA in fact sought to intervene in the case by filing on 26 January 1993
an “Appearance with Motion to Annul the Injunction Order.” Unfortunately, after
it was noted and LASAY was directed to file his “comment and/or opposition
thereto” after which the incident would be submitted for resolution, the
respondent Judge, for reasons known only to him, never did resolve it. Then,
with undue and precipitate haste, he rendered the challenged decision on 24
March 1993. That decision must be set aside for having been rendered with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction since an indispensable
party, GALAROSA, was not effectively impleaded and recognized as a party in the
case and given the opportunity to file a responsive pleading.</p>

<p class="BODY">A remand of this case to the trial court for further proceedings
consistent with the above disquisition would be the natural course of action to
follow. However, considering that the principal issue posed is purely legal and
the pleadings of the parties have exhaustively discussed the main issue and all
collateral matters, the controversy could be forthwith resolved on the basis
thereof. The remand of the case to the trial court would only delay the final
disposition of the case and would not serve the public interest, especially
here where our decision would affect all ABC presidents throughout the country.
We have consistently ruled that the remand of a case to a lower court for the
reception of evidence is not necessary if this Court can already resolve the
dispute on the basis of the records before it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On 7 March 1988, then
President Corazon C. Aquino issued Memorandum Circular No. 51 providing for
policy guidelines on the representation of certain sectors, including the
president of the <i>katipunang bayan</i>, in the legislative bodies of local
governments. Then on 28 November 1988 she issued E.O. No. 342 delegating to the
Secretary </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Local Government
the power to appoint certain local offices under certain sections, including
Section 146(1) of B.P. Blg. 337. Thereafter, appointments of the presidents of

Local Government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately prior to the passage of the Local Government Code of
1991, the <i>katipunang bayan</i> or ABC in a municipality was composed of the
barangay captains who were elected in the barangay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">elections of 28 March 1989 held pursuant to R.A. No. </span>6679. In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the case at bar, it is presumed that GALAROSA

of Sorsogon and was </span>later <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">elected
president of the ABC of Sorsogon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 April 1989, the Department of Local Government issued
Circular No. 89-09 providing for the reorganization of the <i>katipunan ng mga
barangays</i> in all levels and prescribing the guidelines for the election of
their officers. Guideline 2.2 thereof on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">terms

<p class="2Q">“The terms of office of all officers of the katipunan at all levels

appointed.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the president of the <i>katipunang bayan</i> became,
after an appointment extended by the President through the Secretary of the
Department of Local Government, a member of the first <i>sangguniang bayan</i>
organized under the 1987 Constitution following the local elections held on 18
January 1988. That GALAROSA was extended such an appointment is not disputed.</p>

Section 494 speaks of “duly elected presidents of the <i>liga</i>” thereby
clearly implying an election after the organization of the <i>liga</i>, the
conclusion to be drawn is that the legislature never intended that Section 494
would apply to the incumbent presidents of the <i>katipunang bayan</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In short, there is no indication at all that Section 491 and
Section 494 should be given retroactive effect to adversely affect the
presidents of the ABC. They should thus be applied prospectively. There is a
substantive rationale for this. The Local Government Code significantly altered
the previous law and rules relative to the membership of the presidents of the <i>katipunang
bayan</i> or the ABC.  In the first
place, a prior appointment by the President, as required under Section 110(3)
of B.P. Blg. 337 or by him through the Secretary of Interior and Local
Government pursuant to E.O. No. 342, is no longer necessary. It may be pointed
out that B.P. Blg. 337 has been expressly repealed under paragraph (a), Section
534 of the Local Government Code of 1991. Accordingly, E.O. No. 342 is likewise
deemed repealed either as a consequence thereof or under paragraph (f) of the
said section which repeals, <i>inter alia</i>, executive orders inconsistent
with any provisions of the said Code. In the second place, Section 494
specifically provides that the term of office of the <i>liga</i> presidents
shall in no case go “beyond the term of office of the <i>sanggunian</i>
concerned.” Consequently, the expiration of their terms of office as <i>ex
officio</i> members of the <i>sanggunian</i> concerned coincides with the
expiration of the term of office of the regular members thereof. The section,
however, does not fix the specific duration of their term as <i>liga</i>
president. This is left to the by-laws of the <i>liga</i> pursuant to Article
211(g) of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code (IRR
for brevity). It may be recalled that under R.A. No. 6679, the term of office
of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">punong barangay</span></i>
elected in the 28 March 1989 election for barangay officials was five years
commencing on 1 May 1989 and ending on 31 May 1994. It also provides that the
next regular election of barangay officials shall be on the second Monday of
May 1994 and on the same day every five years thereafter and that their term of
office shall begin on the first day of June following their election and until
their successors shall have been elected and qualified. On the other hand,
Section 43(c) of the Local Government Code of 1991 fixes the term of elective
barangay officials at three years which, insofar as those first elected under
it are concerned, shall begin “after the regular election x x x on the second
Monday of May 1994.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, notwithstanding the prospective character of Section
494 of the Local Government Code of 1991, the fact remains that the presidents
of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">katipunang bayan</span></i>
or ABC who were appointed as members of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">sangguniang bayan</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>by
the President through the Secretary of Local Government by virtue of E.O. No.
342 were appointed to the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sangguniang
bayan</span></i> whose regular members were elected in the 18 January 1988
local elections and whose term expired on 30 June 1992. It is to be presumed
that they could not have been appointed for a term beyond that of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sangguniang bayan</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">. </span>This is evident from both Section
110(3) of B.P. Blg. 337 and Circular No. 89-09 of the Department of Local
Government which respectively provide that the term of office of the ABC
presidents therein determined is “without prejudice to their term of office as
member of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sanggunian</span></i>
to which they may be accordingly appointed” and “without prejudice however, to
the terms on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">[sic] </span>their
appointments as member of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sanggunian</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>to which they may be correspondingly
appointed.” Accordingly, while ABC presidents could remain as such after 30
June 1992 because their term of office as ABC presidents have not yet ended,
their term of office as members of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sangguniang
bayan</span></i> had expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, however, no law which prohibits them from <u>holding</u>
<u>over</u> as members of the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sangguniang
bayan</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">. </span>On the
contrary, the aforementioned IRR, prepared and issued by the Oversight

Section 494 of the Local Government Code could not have been intended to allow
a gap in the representation of the barangays, through the presidents of the
ABC, in the <i>sanggunian</i>. Since the term of office of the <i>punong
barangays</i> elected in the 28 March 1989 election and the term of office of
the presidents of the ABC have not yet expired and taking into account the
special role conferred upon and the broader powers and functions invested in
the barangays by the Code as a basic political unit, as a primary planning and
implementing unit of government policies in the community, and as a forum
wherein the collective views of the people may be expressed and considered and
where disputes may be amicably settled,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> it
would be in harmony with sound logic to infer that the Code never intended to
deprive the barangays of their representation in the <i>sangguniang bayan</i>
during the interregnum when the <i>liga</i> has yet to be formally organized
with the election of its officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the promulgation of the IRR by the Oversight Committee
