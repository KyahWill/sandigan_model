				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CUEVAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This CERTIORARI case arose from a contempt proceeding conducted by the Honorable respondent Judge against the herein petitioner captioned "In Re:&nbsp; Contempt Proceedings vs. Hidulfo D. Nazareno, accused" — Criminal Case No. 436 for "Indirect Contempt of Court and Judge of the Court of First Instance", resulting in the issuance of the challenged Order finding petitioner GUILTY of indirect contempt and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment of six (6) months and to pay a fine of One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The aforesaid contempt case was brought about by a letter-complaint dated August 22, 1981,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> addressed by the herein petitioner to His Excellency, Ferdinand E. Marcos, which was subscribed and sworn to before Fiscal Diosdado Llamas.&nbsp; Said letter reads as follows — <blockquote>"August 22, 1981<br>&nbsp;His Excellency<br>Ferdinand E. Marcos<br>Malacañan Palace<br>Manila<br><br>Your Excellency,<br><br>In line with your call to the general public to come up with charges and/or evidence against incompetent and/or corrupt Judges in connection with the reorganization of the Judiciary, I am most respectfully bringing to your attention specific charges against Judge Roque M. Barnes of the Court of First Instance of Baganga, Davao Oriental, which I believe render him unfit to continue as a member of the Judiciary.&nbsp; The following are specification of charges:<br><blockquote>1 - IGNORANCE OF THE LAW:<br><br>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp; In Civil Case No. 174 entitled Baganga Consolidated Arastre-Stevedoring Services, Inc. vs. NLRC, et al., Judge Barnes issued an injunction against the National Labor Relations Commission enjoining an execution issued by the latter.&nbsp; I believe since the NLRC is equal in rank if not higher than the Court of First Instance and said commission has exclusive jurisdiction in Labor cases, Judge Barnes displayed ignorance of the law in entertaining the suit for injunction.&nbsp; It might be mentioned in passing that the NLRC filed a Motion to Dismiss the suit but up to now has not yet been resolved.<br><br>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of People of the Philippines versus Jeonardo Ty docketed as Criminal Case No. R-1116-160, the accused therein was convicted by the Municipal Court of Cateel for Slight Physical Injuries, after which the accused appealed to the Court of First lnstance of Baganga.&nbsp; In a decision dated January 19, 1976, Judge Barnes also found the accused guilty not of Slight Physical Injuries but of Serious Physical Injuries, which decision was promulgated to the accused.&nbsp; However after the promulgation, the accused filed a Motion for Reconsideration based on an Affidavit of Desistance of the complaining party.&nbsp; In an Order dated October 4, 1976, Judge Barnes vacated his previous decision finding the accused innocent of the crime charge solely on the basis of the affidavit of desistance.&nbsp; Considering that the affidavit of desistance was submitted after the promulgation of the judgment, Judge Barnes committed grave error and/or displayed ignorance of the law in changing his decision.&nbsp; Copies of the decision, motion for reconsideration and order are hereto attached as Annexes "A", "B", and "C".<br><br>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of Cresencio Maliño versus Ramon Ramirez vs. (sic) Vicente Estevas, Sr. in Civil Case No. 122 for Reformation of Instrument, Judge Barnes while finding that the property in question was in the possession of the defendant as mortgagee failed to apply the principle of antichresis.&nbsp; Copy of the decision is hereto attached as Annex "D".<br><br>II - ACTS OF HARASSMENT:<br><br>Sometime in October, 1980, Judge Barnes was on a private plane going to Baganga, Davao Oriental from Davao City.&nbsp; The North Camarines Lumber Company which owns the airstrip in Baganga, Davao Oriental advised all incoming planes that the airstrip was being repaired and therefore could not be utilized for that trip.&nbsp; Failing to land in Baganga, Judge Barnes cited Mr. Ching Hai Cuan, the Vice President for Operations of the North Camarines Lumber Company and Miss Norma Lo, the company accountant for Contempt of Court and both were made to explain why the plane carrying Judge Barnes was not allowed to land in the company's airstrip.&nbsp; Both persons had nothing to do in the landing field.<br><br>III - INCURRING INDEBTEDNESS IN THE COMMUNITY:<br><br>It is of public knowledge in the Municipality of Baganga that Judge Barnes has contracted many indebtedness in several stores and from several persons without paying for the same.<br><br>IV - USING UNDUE INFLUENCE:<br><br>On enumerable occasions, Judge Barnes has requested for free rides in the planes of the North Camarines Lumber Company in his trips to and from Baganga, Davao Oriental.&nbsp; Considering that the company has its main offices at Baganga, Davao Oriental under the jurisdiction of Judge Barnes and considering further that the company has cases pending before his sala, it was not proper to secure favors from the company.<br><br>V - HABITUAL ABSENTISM:<br><br>It is also of public knowledge in Baganga, Davao Oriental that Judge Barnes holds sessions only from two to three days a week.<br><br>Your Excellency, in due course I shall also submit other charges against Judge Barnes as soon as I shall have verified certain reports reaching me.&nbsp; I hope that in the interest of attaining the objectives of the Judicial reorganization, persons like Judge Barnes should not be extended a new appointment.<br><br>Very truly yours,<br><br><div align="right">(S/T) HIDULFO D.

The charge reads as follows —<br><blockquote>"The undersigned Presiding Judge hereby charges the above-named accused of the crime of INDIRECT CONTEMPT OF COURT and Judge of the Court of First Instance, defined and penalized under Sec. 3(d) and Sec. 6, Rule 71, Revised Rules of Court, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about August 22, 1981, in a letter-complaint the accused addressed to the President of the Philippines, true copy of which was furnished by the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Baganga, Davao Oriental, and about which the accused have talked in restaurants and to several people in the community of Baganga that he charged the undersigned with ignorance of the law in connection with Civil Case No. 174, entitled "Baganga Consolidated Arastre-Stevedoring Services, Inc. vs. Hon.

and a reasonable time within which to prepare for his defense despite the penal nature of the charge against him.&nbsp; Instead, respondent right then and there proceeded to investigate him on the basis of his letter-complaint to the President<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> which could not in anyway possibly interfere, impede nor obstruct the administration of justice and could not therefore legally serve as a basis for a liability for indirect contempt.<br><br>In his COMMENT filed in compliance with our Resolution of March 8, 1982, respondent Judge alleged that petitioner's Letter-Complaint of August 2, 1982 to President Marcos, charging him of ignorance of the law undermines the faith, respect, trust and confidence of the citizenry in the administration of justice considering that the two cases<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> therein dealt with and complained of are still pending consideration in his sala and therefore <i>sub-judice</i>.<br><br>Respondent Judge also claims that he had been reliably informed that petitioner was not content in merely writing to the President as he had done, but likewise had been talking to a lot of people in restaurants and other places on this same subject — his (respondent's) alleged ignorance of the law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Respondent Judge likewise contends that petitioner was merely seeking refuge under the guise of being a concerned citizen answering the call of the President when in reality he was in truth and in fact really settling a score against respondent who convicted him on appeal in a less serious physical injury case on December 14, 1971.&nbsp; He denied having acted without jurisdiction nor in excess of jurisdiction, much less has he committed grave abuse of discretion in adjudging petitioner guilty of indirect contempt and imposing upon him a fine of P1,000.00 plus six (6) months imprisonment which is in accordance with Rule 71, Section 6 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>At the outset, let it be stated that the contempt proceeding against the petitioner was wrongly initiated.&nbsp; The nature thereof being that of indirect contempt, a written charge is necessary pursuant to Section 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The written charge may partake the nature of (1) an Order requiring the respondent (not accused) to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt for having committed the contemptuous acts imputed against him; or (2) a petition for contempt by way of special civil action under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; The first procedure applies only where the indirect contempt is committed against a court or judge possessed and clothed with contempt powers.&nbsp; The second, if the contemptuous act was committed not against a court nor a judicial officer with authority to punish contemptuous acts.<br><br>Neither of the two modes of commencing an indirect contempt proceeding was resorted to nor availed of in the instant case.&nbsp; What was filed against the herein petitioner was to all intents and legal purposes an information in a criminal case.<br><br>Contempt, however, is not a criminal offense within the meaning of Sec. 87 of the Judiciary Act of 1948, and need not be instituted by means of an information.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The institution of charges by the prosecuting official is not necessary to hold persons guilty of civil or criminal contempt amenable to trial and punishment by the court.&nbsp; All that the law requires is that there be a charge in writing duly filed in court and an opportunity to the person charged to be heard by himself or counsel.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>But even disregarding said procedural infirmities, still we are not prepared to sustain petitioner's conviction.&nbsp; It can not be denied that the letter-complaint authored and addressed by the petitioner to the President was in response to His Excellency's appeal to the public to come up with charges and evidences against incompetent and corrupt judges.&nbsp; Since that was the time when the proposed reorganization of the judiciary was being undertaken the timeliness of the said letter may therefore be conceded.&nbsp; True, a mere casual perusal of the said letter will immediately show that the statements contained therein are apparently degrading to the integrity and competence of the respondent Judge.&nbsp; His Honor's remedy, however, if any exists, against such an onslaught or attack on his character and reputation is a criminal action for defamation<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and not a citation for contempt since the power to punish contempt should be exercised on the preservative and not on vindictive principle.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><blockquote>"A judge, as a public servant, should not be so thin-skinned or sensitive as to feel hurt or offended if a citizen expresses an honest opinion about him which may not altogether be flattering to him.&nbsp; After all, what matters is that a judge performs his duties in accordance with the dictates of his conscience and the light that God has given him.&nbsp; <i>A judge should never allow himself to be moved by pride, prejudice, passion, or pettiness in the performance of his duties</i>.&nbsp; He should always bear in mind that the power of the court to punish for contempt should be exercised for purposes that are impersonal, because that power is intended as a safeguard <i>not for the judges as persons but for</i> the functions that they exercise.<br><br>(Underscoring supplied)<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></blockquote>Anent respondent Judge's assertion that the two cases referred to and dealt with in petitioner's letter are still pending consideration before His sala<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> hence, <i>sub judice</i>, suffice it to state that precisely one of the complaints insofar as Civil Case No. 174 is concerned is the unresolved motion to dismiss which is still then pending despite the lapse of a substantial period of time since its filing.&nbsp; With respect to Civil Case No. 122, the copy of the decision in said case attached to petitioner's letter as Annex D sufficiently negates respondent Judge's assertion that the case is still pending.&nbsp; But be that as it may, it seems clear that petitioner's referral to the two aforementioned cases do not appear motivated by a desire to obstruct nor impede, much less degrade the administration of justice but apparently to make his complaint a more authentic one, hence the said reference to definite cases by way of specifications.<br><br>Another disturbing circumstance which strongly argues for the nullification of petitioner's conviction is the denial of petitioner's right to due process and to counsel.&nbsp; We can not ride along with respondent Judge's feeble reliance upon Section 3, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court in justifying the procedure adopted by His Honor in the questioned contempt proceeding.&nbsp; He claimed that petitioner was given the opportunity to be heard before being adjudged guilty of the charge against him which was in full accord with Section 3 of Rule 71 of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><blockquote>"Section 3.&nbsp; Indirect contempts to be punished after charge and hearing. - After charge in writing has been filed and an opportunity given to the accused to be heard by himself or counsel, a person guilty of any of the following acts may be punished for contempt;<br><br><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx"</center></blockquote>Our review of the records, however, convinces Us that petitioner was not afforded full and real opportunity to be heard.&nbsp; And this is so because he learned of the charge against him only on the very day he was arrested and hailed to court to answer the said charge.&nbsp; Respondent should have granted petitioner ample opportunity to prepare for trial and defend himself.&nbsp; While speedy trial should be encouraged, a person's right to due process should not be sacrificed.&nbsp; In the case at bar, right at the very start and all throughout the proceedings, respondent Judge's burning desire to send petitioner behind bars appeared clearly evident, thereby transforming his court into a despot's forum.&nbsp; By reason thereof, he succeeded in having people, more especially the herein petitioner, lose confidence in courts of justice thereby placing the administration of justice under a cloud of doubt, thus setting at naught his proclaimed attempt to correct petitioner's alleged acts of undermining the faith, respect, trust, and confidence of the citizenry in the court of justice.&nbsp; It should not be lost sight of that contempt proceedings are commonly treated as criminal in nature, the same being penal in character.&nbsp; The safeguards therefore provided for by the Constitution and the Rules of Court in favor of the accused should be similarly accorded to the herein petitioner of which he was denied by the respondent Judge.<br><br>Petitioner's proper and correct remedy against the questioned order of conviction, pursuant to Sec. 10, Rule 71 of the Rules of Court, is appeal.&nbsp; Instead, he has resorted to certiorari.&nbsp; Considering, however, that this case has been pending for quite some time and more specifically the view we take thereon on its merits, to compel petitioner to follow said mode of review, will be sanctifying technicality against substance with no different result in view.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Order convicting petitioner of indirect contempt is hereby <b>REVERSED</b>, and he is hereby relieved of any liability for indirect contempt.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Concepcion, Jr.</i>, and <i>Escolin, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><i>Makasiar, J., (Chairman)</i>, an administrative case should be filed against respondent Judge Roque M.
