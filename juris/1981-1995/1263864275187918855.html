is a private, fee-charging, recruitment and employment agency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In accordance with the requirements of
Section 4, Rule II, Book II of the Rules and Regulation of the Philippine
Overseas Employment Administration (POEA), Pan Pacific posted a surety bond
issued by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> General Assurance
Corporation ("<span class="SpellE">Finman</span>") and was granted a
license to operate by the POEA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents William <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span>,
Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Palero</span>, Jr., Edwin <span class="SpellE">Cardones</span>
and one Edwin Hernandez filed with the POEA separate complaints against Pan
Pacific for violation of Articles 32 and 34 (a) of the Labor Code, as amended
and for refund of placement fees paid to Pan Pacific.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainants alleged that Pan Pacific
charged and collected such fees from them but did not secure employment for
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the complaints, the POEA Administrator <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> as
party respondent in its capacity as surety for Pan Pacific.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Separate summonses were served upon <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> and Pan Pacific.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The return of the summons served on Pan Pacific at its official address
registered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>the POEA records,
showed that Pan Pacific had moved out <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>; no
prior notice of transfer or change of address was furnished by Pan Pacific to
the POEA as required under POEA rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The POEA considered that constructive service of the complaints had been
<span class="GramE">effected</span> upon Pan Pacific and proceeded accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> filed
an answer denying liability and pleading, by way of special and affirmative
defenses, that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">POEA </span>had no "jurisdiction over
surety bonds," <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>jurisdiction
being vested in the Insurance Commission or the regular courts; (2) it (<span class="SpellE">Finman</span>) had not violated Articles 32 and 34 (a) of the
Labor Code and complainants’ claims had accrued during the suspension of the
principal obligor, Pan Pacific; (3) complainants had no cause of action against
<span class="SpellE">Finman</span>, since it was not privy to the transactions
between them and Pan Pacific and had not received any moneys from them; and (4)
the amounts claimed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span>complainants
had been paid by them as deposits and not as placement fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">A hearing was held by the POEA on <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="4">14 April 1988</st1:date>, at which time complainants presented their
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="5">30 May 1989</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> went on appeal to the
Secretary of Labor insisting that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
the POEA had no authority to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> petitioner as
party respondent in the proceedings before the POEA; and that (2) the POEA had
no authority to enforce directly the surety bond against petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an Order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="8">3 August 1989</st1:date>, the Secretary of Labor upheld the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">POEA </span>Order appealed from and denied
the appeal for lack of merit.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> now comes before this
Court on a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with prayer for preliminary
injunction or temporary restraining order, raising much the same issues it had
already ventilated before the POEA and the Secretary of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is contended once again by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> that the POEA had no authority to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> petitioner in the proceedings commenced by private
respondents; and that the POEA was not authorized to require, in those same
proceedings, petitioner to pay private respondents' claims for refund against
Pan Pacific on the basis of the surety bond issued by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contentions are interrelated and will be dealt with
together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are, however, quite
bereft of merit and must be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner cannot seriously dispute the direct and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> nature of its obligations under its own surety
bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 176 of the Insurance
Code, as amended, the liability of a surety in a surety bond is joint and
several with the principal obligor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's bond was posted by Pan Pacific in compliance with the
requirements of Article 31 of the Labor Code, which states that ---</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 31.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Bonds</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-- All applicants for license or authority
shall post such cash and <u>surety bonds</u> as determined by the Secretary of
Labor <u>to guarantee compliance with prescribed recruitment procedures, rules
and regulations, and terms and conditions of employment as appropriate</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Secretary of Labor shall have the exclusive power to determine,
decide, order or direct payment from, or application of, the cash and surety
bond for any claim or injury covered and guaranteed by the bonds."
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The tenor and scope of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman's</span> obligations under the bond it issued are set out

bond</u> of P150,000.00 from a bonding company acceptable to the Administration
duly accredited by the Office of the Insurance Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bonds shall answer for <u>all valid and
legal claims arising from violations of the conditions for the grant and use of

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">While petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span>
has refrained from attaching a copy of the bond it had issued to its Petition
for <i>Certiorari</i>, there can be no question that the conditions of the <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> surety bond Pan Pacific had posted with the POEA
include the underscored portions of Section 4, Rule II, <span class="GramE">Book</span>
I quoted above.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is settled doctrine
that the conditions of a bond specified and required in the provisions of the
statute or regulation providing for the submission of the bond, are
incorporated or built into all bonds tendered under that statute or regulation,
even though not there set out in printer’s ink.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the POEA held, and the Secretary of Labor
affirmed, that Pan Pacific had violated Article 32 of the Labor Code, as
amended</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Article 32.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Fees to be paid by
workers</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-- <u>Any person
applying</u> with a private fee charging employment agency for employment
assistance <u>shall not be charged any fee until he has obtained employment
through its efforts or has actually commenced employment</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such fee shall be always covered with the
approved receipt clearly showing the amount paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of Labor shall promulgate a schedule
of allowable fees." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">as</span> well as
Article 34 (a) of the same Code:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Article 34.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Prohibited practices</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-- It shall be unlawful for any individual,
entity, licensee, or holder of authority:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>To charge or
accept, directly or indirectly, any amount greater than that specified in the
schedule of allowable fees prescribed by the Secretary of Labor</u>, or to make
a worker pay any amount greater than actually received by him as a loan or
advance." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">There is, hence, no question that, both
under the Labor Code<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

Pan Pacific had violated at least one of the conditions for the grant and
continued use of the recruitment license granted to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">can,
s</span>imilarly, be no question that the POEA Administrator and the Secretary
of Labor are authorized to require Pan Pacific to refund the placement fees it
had charged private respondents without securing employment for them and to
impose the fine of P60<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> upon Pan Pacific.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 36 of the Labor Code authorizes the
Secretary of Labor "to restrict and regulate” the recruitment and
placement activities of agencies like Pan Pacific and "<u>to issue orders</u>
and promulgate rules and regulations <u>to carry out the objectives and
implement the provisions</u> of [Title I on "Recruitment and Placement of
Workers]," including of course, Article 32 on “Fees to be paid by
workers," quoted earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
other hand, Section 13 of Rule VI, Book I of the POEA Rules and Regulations
expressly authorize the POEA Administrator or the Secretary of Labor to impose
fines "in addition to or in lieu of the penalties of suspension or
cancellation" of the violator recruitment agency's license.</p>

<p class="BODY">If Pan Pacific is liable to private respondents for the refunds claimed
by them and to the POEA for the fine of P60<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
and if petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> is <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
liable with Pan Pacific under the operative terms of the bond, it must follow
that <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> is liable both to the private respondents
and to the POEA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> asserts, however, that the POEA had no authority to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> it in the proceedings against Pan Pacific.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded by this assertion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span>
is a party-in-interest in, certainly a proper party to, the proceedings private
respondents had initiated against Pan Pacific the principal obligor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since Pan Pacific had thoughtfully refrained
from notifying the POEA of its new address and from responding to the
complaints, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> may well be regarded as
an indispensable party to the proceedings before the POEA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> was
an indispensable or merely a proper party to the proceedings, we believe and so
hold that the POEA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">could </span>properly
<span class="SpellE">implead</span> it as party respondent either upon the
request of the private respondents or, as it happened, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such is the situation under the Revised Rules of Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and the application thereof, directly or by analogy, by the POEA can certainly
not be regarded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>arbitrary, oppressive or capricious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fundamental argument of <span class="SpellE">Finman</span> is
that its liability under its own bond must be determined and enforced, not by
the POEA or the Secretary of Labor, but rather by the Insurance Commission or
by the regular courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once more, we are
not moved by petitioner's argument.</p>

<p class="BODY">There appears nothing <span class="GramE">so</span> special or
unique about the determination of a surety's liability under its bond as to
restrict that determination to the Office of the Insurance Commissioner and to
the regular courts of justice exclusively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The exact opposite is strongly stressed by the second paragraph of
Article 31 of the Labor Code:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">''Art.</span> 31.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Bonds</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-- x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Secretary of Labor shall have the exclusive <u>power to
determine, decide, order or</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>direct
payment from</u>, or application of, <u>the</u> cash or <u>surety bond for any
claim</u> or injury <u>covered and guaranteed by the bonds</u>."
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We </span>believe and so hold that to compel the
POEA and private respondents -- the beneficiaries of <span class="SpellE">Finman's</span>
bond -- to go to the Insurance Commissioner or to a regular court of law to
enforce that bond, would be to collide with the public policy which requires
prompt resolution of claims against private recruitment and placement
agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court will take judicial
notice of the appalling frequency with which some, perhaps many, of such
agencies have cheated workers avid for overseas employment by, e.g., collecting
placement fees without securing employment for them at all, extracting
exorbitant fees or "kickbacks" from those for whom employment is
actually obtained, abandoning hapless and unlettered workers to exploitative
foreign principals, and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cash and
surety bonds are required by the POEA and its predecessor agencies from
recruitment and employment companies precisely as a means of ensuring prompt
and effective recourse against such companies when held liable for applicants’
or workers' claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly that public
policy will be effectively negated if POEA and the Department of Labor and
Employment were held powerless to compel a surety company to make good on its <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> undertaking in the same quasi-judicial proceeding
where the liability of the principal obligor, the recruitment or employment
agency, is determined and fixed and where the surety is given reasonable
opportunity to present any defenses it or the principal obligor may be entitled
to set up<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Petitioner surety whose liability to
private respondents and the POEA is neither more nor less than that of Pan
Pacific, is not entitled to another or different procedure for determination or
fixing of that liability than that which Pan Pacific is entitled and subject
to.</p>
