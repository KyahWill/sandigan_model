</span>Proceeding to the place where the water pump of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> was located, they roused from his sleep
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> who tended the water pump.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They tied his hands at his back and forcibly
brought him along with them to the residence of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Granil</span> was directed to call out his employer, which he
did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>
left his bed and opened the door of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, accused <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Magday</span> fired at him with a <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">garand</span></span> rifle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> fell wounded but he managed to crawl to the

and their 14 year old daughter, <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>,
rushed to his aid and they wiped the blood oozing from his wounded leg with a
blanket.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lourdes then went out of the
room to go to the kitchen but was not able to reach the place because Silvestre
<span class="SpellE">Granil</span> and some of the accused, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Magday</span>, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagarro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Catalan and <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> were already

neighbor's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> tried to enter the room where the wounded <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> was, but the latter fired at him with his gun
which he somehow managed to get.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this
juncture, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Magday</span>
entered the room and hit <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> with the butt of his gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the accused were ransacking the family wardrobe, <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>
heard her father telling her to go down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whereupon, she took her youngest brother and they sought refuge in a
neighbor's house just as their mother did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Florencio's</span> son who was then only about 12 years old
stayed in the house as he was asked to remain by his father who was
subsequently shot by Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the accused had taken from the wardrobe the things they
wanted to take, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> and Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span> caused the "<span class="SpellE">aparador</span>"
to fall down pinning the victim <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before
leaving they took <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio's</span> gun, the wife's piggy
bank containing loose coins and thereafter, left bringing along with them the
body of their companion, Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> and their
hostage Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>.</p>

had sought refuge and informed them of the death of his father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They all stayed in the house of their
neighbor until <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00</st1:time> in the morning
when they returned to their house and found the body of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> pinned under the fallen <span class="SpellE">aparador</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The body of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>

their hostage Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> for fear that he might
squeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>
was taken to the edge of the creek and in a semi-kneeling position, was hacked
three times on the neck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When people

</span>Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> arrived and invited them to
go with him and his New People's Army companions at <span class="SpellE">Amacalan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They would not want to go but because they
were afraid of the NPA companions of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>,
they acceded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He (Salvador <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>), upon reaching the fields, managed to escape from
the group and went home directly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
already in his house when he heard the firing of a gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following morning, he came to know that <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> had been
killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Salvador <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> was arrested by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Benicta</span> and brought to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makabulos</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
where he met several persons who, he was told, were his companions in the
killing at <span class="SpellE">Amacalan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">He was then brought to the PC headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>
where he was maltreated and then investigated and ordered to sign a statement,
the contents of which he had never read much less knew.</p>

arrived with several companions, armed with deadly weapons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>
asked him to accompany them to the residence of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
was forced to do so because of fear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, upon reaching the place, Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>
and his companions allowed him to go home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was at his residence when he heard the firing of guns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Like his co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagarro</span> was brought to the headquarters, maltreated and
made to sign a statement (Exhibits "J" and "J-1").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He signed the same for fear of bodily harm
and because the judge himself insisted that he sign it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The common defense is that accused-appellants are poor and
unschooled farmers who do not know how to read and can only write their names;
that the extra-judicial statements were extracted by force and intimidation and
therefore should be discredited and held inadmissible in evidence; and, that
they were not at the scene of the crime at the time it happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, sustaining the allegations of the information,
said:</p>

<blockquote>"An examination of the confessions of each of the nine accused
reveals that while each statements is different from the others with no two of
them exactly alike and with certain significant variances among them, they all
dovetail on certain material aspects of the case, saying so expressly or at
least implicitly, which are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
determination or plan to rob the house of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> on the evening of May 8, 1972; (2) rousing (by
them) of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> who was the farm helper of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> from<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>sleep in a shed housing a water pump, tying
his hands behind his back, marching him to the house of <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>,
and making him call out for <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>; (3) <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> being awakened or responding to the call of the
farm helper Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>; (4) <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> being fired upon and wounded while in the <span class="SpellE"><u>bangsal</u></span> or kitchen of his house and being killed
later that evening; (5) the entry into <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio's</span>
house by some of the accused; (6) Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>
who was one of the culprits barging into the house ahead of the others being
fired upon by <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> with a .38 caliber revolver
and being slain inside the house, his corpse being brought down the house by
some of his companions and later taken to the <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
River and from the <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> River being taken on board
a sledge to <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>; (7) the ransacking of the house and the
taking of a piggy bank containing coins and the .38 caliber revolver of <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>; and (8) the slaying of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> in order to prevent him from identifying any of the
accused, with the use of a bolo owned by <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagarro</span> applied for three (3) times on the neck.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There are other important matters to be observed in the
confessions which are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) The
confessions are replete with details and the answers given to most of the
questions far exceeded what were called for in the questions; (2) the questions
were varied, not uniform, in certain cases jumping to unrelated points but the
answers although varied and never repeating what the others said, and although
still containing outright variances, gave a oneness in the totality of the
happening; (3) there were variances on many points like on the one who tied
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil's</span> hands and even on the one who hacked
Mariano to death; on the one who fired at <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> although most of statements pointed to <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Magday</span> and which fact
of having shot <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> was admitted by <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Magday</span> himself, even
on the original purpose of going to <span class="SpellE">Amacalan</span>, some
claiming the motive was to kill <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> and some
was to rob <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>, but the variances only appeared
to strengthen rather than weaken the fact of the happening of the robbing and
the killing; (4) the confessions of <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magday</span> of having taken money in the house of the deceased
in the amount of P34.00 in coins of P0.10 and P0.25 denominations which they
divided between the two of them, being confirmed by the finding of the amounts
of P17.00 each in the house of <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magday</span>, "O" &amp; "P"; (5) the
Springfield rifles, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "D" &amp;
"E", confessedly held by Jose <span class="SpellE">Gariles</span> and
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Panag</span> being recovered in places they
indicated to the investigators.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With the foregoing observations, this Court cannot but arrive
at the conclusion that the statements were spontaneously given by the accused
and that far from being coerced or from having been given under duress, said
statements were in fact freely given.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another aspect of the <span class="GramE">case which strongly
militate</span> against the claim of coercion or force being allegedly used in
the taking of the confessions was that the said statements were sworn to by the
<span class="SpellE">declarants</span> before two municipal judges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both Judges de <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cabarios</span> testified that they read the statements
aloud and explained to the accused their contents and the accused having
confirmed the <span class="GramE">contents,</span> had been made to take oath
thereon and thereafter had signed them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And although PC soldiers accompanied the accused when they swore to the
statements, the accused in the presence of the judge could have communicated
their disagreement or could have disowned them, but they did not, which
strongly indicate the falsity of the present claim of the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defense in repudiating the statements ascribed to them,
in effect raised the question of conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The concerted action of the accused in getting the farm helper who was
staying in a shed housing a water pump located some distance away from the
house of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span>
in order to use the farm-help to lure <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> to
open his house, firing at <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> and killing him,
getting inside the house in search of money, and thereafter getting out of the
house, disposing of the body of their companion Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>,
and slaying Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> in order to prevent him
from testifying against the accused, in all of which none of the accused had made
any move to prevent any of them from carrying out their apparent plans, is
proof of the existence of conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For direct proof of the planning or the conspiracy among the parties is
not required.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Direct proof in fact is
not always available inasmuch as conspiracy or the planning of the commission
of a crime is obviously made in secret and circumstantial evidence is
sufficient to establish the conspiracy (P. vs. Peralta, 25 SCRA 759).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The members of a band or group having decided
to commit robbery in band are equally liable for the act committed by any of
them in the course of the robbery or on the occasion thereof (P. vs. <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>, 20 SCRA 153).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The confessions or admissions made by the accused in their
statements in which they admitted having planned the commission of the crime
taken in conjunction with the fact of the crime, is (sic) proof of the
existence of the said conspiracy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In their defense the accused claim that they were never at
the scene of the alleged robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tagarro</span> had admitted in their testimony in Court that
they were anywhere near or around the house of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> on the evening of <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But they were forced to go by a group of armed men who were <span class="SpellE">NPAs</span> not known to them and with whom they went upon the
urgings of Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> who had been asked by the
armed men to take them to the house of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> on the evening in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They reluc­tantly went with the group, but as
soon as they can leave without being detected, they had gone back to their
respective homes and they did not know anything else although they later
learned that Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Granil</span> had been slain and that
<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> had
also been killed when his house was entered and robbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alibi requires a greater depth or measure of
proof than a bare claim that they in whose behalf such defense is raised were
in another place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For alibi can be so
easily concocted and on the face of overwhelming proof to the contrary, such
defense cannot hold." (pp. 151?156, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Going over the confessions of herein appellants (Exhibits
"F", "G", "H", "I", "J",
"K", "L", "M" and "N"), it is apparent
that the constitutional guarantee of the right to counsel and to remain silent
has not been followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
considering that said statements of appellants were obtained before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Constitution on January 17, 1973,
this matter has been settled in the case of <span class="SpellE">Magtoto</span>
vs. Hon. Miguel <span class="SpellE">Manguera</span>, 63 SCRA 4 when the Court
ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"A confession obtained from a person under investigation for
the commission of an offense, who has not been informed of his right (to
silence and) to counsel, is inadmissible in evidence if the same had been
obtained after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New
Constitution on January 17, 1973.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, such confession is admissible in evidence against the
accused, if the same had been obtained before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the New Constitution, even if presented after <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>, and even if he had not been informed of
his right to counsel, since no law gave the accused the right to be so informed
before that date.</blockquote>

by Section 20, Article IV of the New Constitution to counsel and to be informed
of said right under pain of a confession taken in violation thereof being
rendered inadmissible in evidence, clearly shows the intention to give this
constitutional guaranty not a retroactive, but a prospective, effect so as to
cover only confessions taken after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
the New Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, the objections of appellants to the
admissibility of said confessions cannot be sustained.</p>

hearing)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, the claim of appellants that the
extra-judicial confessions are not corroborated by evidence is devoid of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>
and his sister <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> had
positively identified some of them as among the perpetrators of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is also no merit to appellants' contention that the trial
court erred in holding that there was conspiracy among them in the commission
of the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argue that their
extrajudicial confessions are not sufficient to establish conspiracy since the
confession of one is not admissible as evidence against the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As held in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>, 11 SCRA 194, conspiracy may be inferred from the
individual confessions of the defendants. "These confessions are so
intimately interwoven that it is hard, if not impossible, to draw a line with a
view to sifting the individually admitted facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of collusion among the <span class="SpellE">declarants</span>, their confessions should be read together, in
order to form a complete picture of the whole situation, and to consider them
collectively merely as corroborative and/or confirmatory of the evidence
independent <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that two victims died in connection with a robbery, in
the complex offense of robbery with homicide, does not destroy the essential
unity of the crime, nor make two offenses where otherwise there would be only
one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The number of victims is
immaterial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of People
vs. Manuel, 44 Phil. 333, "attention may properly be here directed to the
rule - also elemental in this branch of the law that an offense of the
character of that now under consideration is nonetheless a complex offense by
reason of the fact that double homicide (or murder) is committed instead of a
single homicide (or murder), the number of the victims being immaterial (<span class="SpellE">Viada</span>, 4 Supp., 413)."</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the lower court did not err in appreciating the aggravating
circumstances of nighttime and abuse of superior strength.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellants specifically sought night­time to
facilitate the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As aptly stated by the Solicitor General in his brief, appellants
"could not have just held captive Mariano <span class="SpellE">Granil</span>
and reached the residence of <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ermitanio</span> at <span class="SpellE">Amacalan</span>, Gerona, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, coming from the neighboring barrio of Cardona, of
that same municipality, during the daytime carrying various firearms without
risking being seen or detected by at least the residents in the area where they
passed through.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule is settled that
to take advantage of a fact or circumstance in committing a crime clearly
implies an intention to do so, and one does not avail oneself of the darkness
unless one intended to do so (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-19491, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="8"><span class="GramE">Aug. 30, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
24 SCRA 800)."</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1979</st1:date>,
this Court issued a resolution as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"L-48273 (People vs. Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Pamintuan</span>,
et al.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- Considering the letter of the
Acting Director of Prisons, Vicente R. <span class="SpellE">Raval</span>, dated
March 14, 1979 informing the Court of the death of appellant <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Catalan y <span class="SpellE">Balmores</span> alias
'<span class="SpellE">Cario</span>' on February 2, 1979 and the comment of the
Solicitor General on aforesaid letter, the Court Resolved to DISMISS the case
against said appellant but only insofar as his criminal liability is
concerned."</blockquote>
