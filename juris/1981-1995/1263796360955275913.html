				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The decisive issue in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">instant
</span>petition is whether or not petitioner University of the Philippines (UP)
is <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with Beta <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Construction </span>Company, Inc., to pay the
amount of P68<span class="GramE">,843.98</span> representing the unpaid balance
for labor and materials expended in the plumbing and extra works performed at
the Biological Science Building of the U.P. College of Agriculture, by the
sub-contractor, Allied Plumbing Company, the private respondent herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1966, the UP and Beta Construction Co., Inc.,
entered into a contract for the latter to construct the Biological Science
Building of the U.P. College of Agriculture at Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>,
Laguna for a total lump sum price of Three Million Seven Hundred Ninety <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Two Thousand Two Hundred Eighteen Pesos and
Seven Centavos (P3,792,218.07).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1967</st1:date>,
Beta subcontracted its plumbing works to private respondent Allied Plumbing
Company represented by its general manager Domingo P. Gabriel for the total
amount of One Hundred Fifty Five Thousand Eight Hundred Twenty Eight and 60/100
Pesos (P155<span class="GramE">,828.60</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">The plumbing contract was duly approved by the U.P. Bidding
Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the ground that after Allied Plumbing Company completed its
works, Beta refused to remit the balance of P64,626.08 plus the payment of
additional works asked by Beta in the total amount of P4,017.90, the former
filed a complaint for "sum of money with damages" against U.P. and
Beta with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants denied the allegations of the plaintiff that the
latter had completed its plumbing works under the sub-contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contended that there was delay in
payment due to the improper and faulty plumbing connections made by the
plaintiff; that the plaintiff was unable to complete the work stipulated in the
sub-contract and that the work completed including the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">additional </span>works by the plaintiff were later found to be grossly
defective and had to be repaired and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">re-done
by Beta; that because of the incompetence of the plaintiff, Beta was compelled
to engage the services of another plumbing contractor who repaired the work;
and that Beta overpaid the amount of P81,686.00 under the plumbing sub-contract
which plaintiff is under obligation to return to Beta.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">After trial on the
merits, the lower court rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

(pp. 131-132, Record on Appeal)</p>

<p class="BODY">Only U.P. appealed the decision to the then Intermediate
Appellate Court, now Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The decision was affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
motion for reconsideration was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date month="9" day="30" year="1985">September
 30, 1985</st1:date>, we gave due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner questions the findings of facts of the appellate
court which adopted those of the lower court, to wit:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Plaintiff completed the contracted plumbing and extra work in
November, 1968.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, of the
contracted price of P155<span class="GramE">,828.60</span> defendant Beta paid
plaintiff only the amount of P91,202.52 thereby leaving a balance unpaid of
P64,626.08 for the plumbing works on the <st1:place><st1:placename>Biological</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Science</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff likewise was not paid the contract
price of P2<span class="GramE">,985.00</span> and P1,032.90, respectively, for
the extra work it performed at the request of defendant Beta which defendant UP
also approved, despite presentation of the corresponding statements of
accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The total claim, therefore, of
plaintiff amounted to P68<span class="GramE">,643.98</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the failure of defendant Beta <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span>pay plaintiff for the balance of
the plumbing and extra works, plaintiff sent a letter, dated November 4, 1968
to defendant UP, through its Project Manager at the job site, requesting the
latter ‘not to approve the final payment and retention due and payable to the
general contractor Beta Construction Co., Inc., without a written certification
from us, that we have been fully paid of their obligations to us.’ The
aforesaid letter was duly received on November 7, 1968 and was followed by a
demand letter dated August 4, 1969 which plaintiff sent to defendant UP,
through its College of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>Agriculture,
and copies of which were furnished also the Dean and Auditor of the college and
duly received by the addressees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failing
to get any reply, plaintiff endorsed the matter to a lawyer, who sent to the
College of Agriculture and to the Project Manager two demand letters, both of
which were left unanswered by defendant UP (pp. 123-124, Record on Appeal)"
(p. 51, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In affirming the decision of the trial court, the appellate court
applied Article 1729 of the New Civil Code which states:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Those who put their labor upon or furnish materials for a
piece of work undertaken by the contractor have an action against the owner up
to the amount owing from the latter to the contractor at the time the claim is
made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the following shall not
prejudice the laborers, employees and furnishers of materials:</p>

<p class="2Q">“(1<span class="GramE">) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Payments</span>
made by the owner to the contractor before they are due;</p>

<p class="2Q">“(2<span class="GramE">) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Renunciation</span> by the contractor of any
amount due him from the owner.</p>

<p class="2Q">"This article is subject to the provisions of special
laws."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court ruled that the private respondent had a
lawful claim against UP, owner of the constructed building pursuant to Article
1729 in view of the following facts:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Plaintiff notified defendant UP in writing as early as
November 7, 1968 that plaintiff had not been fully paid by the general
contractor and accordingly requested defendant UP not to release to said
contractor 'the final payment for the 100% completion and the payment of the
retention.' Nevertheless, defendant UP released payments to defendant BETA from
<st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1968</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1970</st1:date> and thereafter,
thereby defeating plaintiff's claim for the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> unpaid price of the work it contracted for and performed.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Defendant UP's own Exhibit "2-UP" shows that <u>said
defendant disregarded the notice of claim of plaintiff, at a time when the
amounts owing from defendant UP to defendant Beta were more than sufficient to
pay for </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">plaintiff's claim</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
19th and 20th payments alone which were released on November 25, 1968 and
September 1, 1969, respectively, or after receipt of plaintiff's claim on
November 7, 1968 amounted to P158,490.70.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And from the 21st to the 25th and final payments, defendant UP released
to defendant Beta the net amount of P167,402.55 covering the period November 3,
1968 up to February 20, 1970.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, pp. 125-126, Underscoring supplied).</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing, Appellant did not approve the work
accomplished by Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> because it
disregarded the notice of claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
it cannot be said that <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> claim was not yet
due and demandable since it was Appellant's inaction that precipitated the
appealed case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for
Appellant's total disregard of Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>
claim, it should not have been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as a party
defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As aptly
observed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, ‘the least that Appellant should
have done was to withhold payment of the balance still owing to defendant Beta
as of </span><st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="11"><span class="GramE">November
 7, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> until the claim of plaintiff was

55-56, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner refutes these findings by stating that Article
1729 contemplates "those who actually furnish labor and materials and as
per specification and not those who furnish defective works." The
petitioner maintains that the private respondent did not fully accomplish the
plumbing works specified in the subcontract; and that there was actually
"overpayment" by Beta.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also states that the word "claim” in the same
provision refers to claims that are due and demandable or valid claims
enforceable in law and does not, therefore, apply to a claim which a
sub-contractor has no right to make against his contractor as in the instant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">case where the work accomplished by private
respondent as a sub-contractor had no recorded approval by UPCA pursuant to
their agreement dated January 4, 1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner submits that it is the burden of the private respondent
to show that the former gave the required approval for work accomplished
adequately and per specifications under the sub-contract agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The sub-contract between
private respondent Allied Plumbing Company represented by its General Manager
Domingo P. Gabriel and Beta provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class="GramE">(p. 16, Record on Appeal; Underlining supplied).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner became party to this sub-contract when it was
approved by the UP Bidding Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">This stipulation in the sub-contract is clear and leaves no doubt
as to the intention of the contracting parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the literal meaning of the stipulation shall control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the first rule in the interpretation
of contracts (Article 1370, New Civil Code; La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span>
Cigar &amp; Cigarette Factory v. Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations, 123
SCRA 679).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the law between the
parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is essential that there must be approval of the works
completed by the private respondent before UP can be made liable under the
sub-contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is of no moment that
the private <span class="GramE">respondent,</span> wrote UP that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Beta, the contractor had not yet paid all its
obligations to the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This does not
necessarily mean approval of the private respondent's works.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Moreover, it is to be
noted that this letter was forwarded to Beta for clarification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And in a letter dated August 13, 1969
addressed to the Office of the Project Manager, Technical &amp; Administrative
Unit, UPCA 5-year Development Program, College, Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>,
Laguna, Beta stated that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"It is not true that we had stopped paying Mr. Gabriel since
July, 1968, the truth being that we were forced to make the purchases of materials
ourselves and pay his laborers due to Mr. Gabriel's own consistent inability to
perform his work with reasonable efficiency and within allowable time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There have been several written
communications from us to Mr. Gabriel regarding this matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We even reiterated in writing our invitation
to Mr. Gabriel for a conference on this matter, but he had consistently
disregarded our invitations for conference.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The UPCA has been fully aware of this matter since the outset, as per
reports of its engineers.</p>

<p class="2Q">"In fact, Mr. Domingo Gabriel had been overpaid by us over and
above his contract price based on an accomplishment of 91.1% given by UPCA as
of our last collection <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"We are even assessing the damage suffered by us as a result
of the failure of Mr. Gabriel to perform his work.</p>

<p class="2Q">"We <u>are therefore suggesting that you disregard the
unfounded claims of Mr. Gabriel as acts of pure harassment against us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
19.0pt">in </span>fact aggrieved parties of Mr. Gabriel's negligence and malice</u>."
(pp. 29-30, Record on Appeal; Underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Faced with these two conflicting claims, the petitioner should
not be faulted for relying on the contractor's claim that it paid all its
obligations to the private respondent and at the same time disregarding the <span class="SpellE">latters</span>' claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence showing approval of the works performed by the
private respondent pursuant to the terms of the sub-contract.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Hence, we agree with the
Solicitor General that the private respondent had no valid claim against the
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1729 of the New Civil Code also states that its
provisions are subject to special laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, the appellate court applying Act No. 3959 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(An Act making it obligatory for any person,
company, firm or corporation owning any work of any kind executed by contract
to require the contractor to furnish a bond guaranteeing the payment of the

before a notary public or other officer authorized by law to administer oaths.'
There is no showing that defendant UP, as owner of the building, complied with
this requirement laid down in Act No. 3959.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, under Section 2 of said law, said defendant is responsible,
jointly and severally with the general contractor, defendant Beta, for the

corporations using the services of contractors who may employ their own
carpenters, masons, and laborers or hire sub-contractors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is made even more evident by the fact
that Presidential Decree No. 442, The Labor Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Articles 106 to 109 and its Rules and Regulations, Rule VIII, Sections 7-9,
have superseded Act 3959.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Code
does not cover government employment.</p>

instruction in literature, philosophy, the sciences and arts, and to give
professional and technical training." (Mindanao Federation of Labor v.
University of the Philippines, 138 SCRA 623, citing University of the
Philippines v. Court of Industrial Relations, et al., 107 Phil. 848).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, UP performs a governmental
function.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is neither a corporation
created for profit nor an industry or business corporation, but it is a public
institution of higher learning created for a fundamental public purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that it was in furtherance of its governmental
function as an institution of higher learning that the UP <span class="SpellE">bidded</span>
out the construction of the Biological Science Building of the College of
Agriculture at Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>, Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the construction of this building
should be considered as a construction of public works.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, Beta, the contractor posted a
"performance bond" in the amount of P758<span class="GramE">,443.61</span>
"conditioned for the faithful performance of the contract and for the full
payment of all obligation and fees (legal or business) arising <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>."</p>
