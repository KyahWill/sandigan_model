				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">JUDGE JOSE R. SEBASTIAN, Metropolitan Trial Court, Br, 78,
Parañaque, is charged administratively as follows:  (1) in A.M. No. MTJ-88-160, for gross ignorance of the law, abuse
of authority, serious misconduct and irregularity in the performance of
official duties relative to the issuance and enforcement of the writ of
execution in Civil Case No. 7342; (2) in A.M. No. MTJ-88-244, for partiality,
oppression and abuse of discretion relative to Civil Case No. 7611; (3) in A.M.
No. MTJ-89-322, for partiality and failure to decide Crim. Case No. 68688
within the 90-day reglementary period; (4) in A.M. No. MTJ-89-344, for serious
misconduct; (5) in A.M. No. MTJ-90-416, for dishonesty, misconduct and
ignorance of the law relative to Civil Case No. 3591; (6) in A.M. No.
MTJ-92-661, for falsification of public document and direct bribery; and, (7)
in A.M. No. MTJ-­89-4-371, for misappropriation of public funds, dismissal of a
criminal case for pecuniary benefit without approval of the Fiscal,
falsification of public document, acting both as judge and prosecutor in a
certain case, illegal exaction, immorality and misconduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 July 1990, the Court resolved to consolidate A.M. No.
MTJ-90-416 (Gavia v. Sebastian) with A.M. No. MTJ-88-160 (Garciano v.
Sebastian), A.M. No. MTJ-88-244 (Lopez v. Sebastian, et al.), A.M. No.
MTJ-89-322 (Vilbar v. Sebastian), A.M. No. MTJ-89-344 (Lopez v. Sebastian), and
A.M. No. MTJ-89-4-371 (Administrative Complaint of MeTC Personnel, Br. 78,
Parañaque v. Sebastian), and to refer the cases to Executive Judge Santiago J.
Ranada, Jr., RTC, Makati, for investigation, report and recommendation
considering that A.M. No. MTJ-89-4-371 was previously referred to him in the
Resolution of 14 November 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 July 1992, the Court consolidated A.M. No. MTJ-92-661
(Office of the Court Administrator v. Sebastian), a later case, with the rest
of the administrative cases against respondent judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> The
Office of <span style="">the Court Administrator
through Deputy Court </span>Administrator Juanito A. Bernad in a letter dated
15 September 1992 referred the case to Judge Job B. Madayag, the new Executive
Judge, for inclusion in the investigation, report and recommendation, as the
other six (6) administrative cases had already been previously referred to then
Executive Judge Ranada.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, it appears that upon the expiration of the term of Judge
Ranada, Jr., as Executive Judge, these cases were raffled to the judges in the
RTC at Makati:  Judge Josefina
Guevarra-Salonga had the records of A.M. Nos. MTJ-88-160, MTJ-88-244,
MTJ-89-322, MTJ-89-344; Judge Julio R. Logarta, the records of A.M. No.
MTJ-89-4-371; and Judge Job B. Madayag, the records of MTJ-92-661.  Upon being advised of the raffle of the
consolidated cases to different RTC judges in Makati, the Office of the Court
Administrator in a Memorandum dated 16 November 1992 informed this Court of
these developments and that only Judge Logarta was able to conduct the
investigation of the case assigned to him.  It then recommended that considering that these administrative cases
were consolidated, they should be assigned to only one judge for investigation,
report and recommendation.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 3 December 1992, the Court referred all the seven (7)
administrative cases to Judge Julio R. Logarta, RTC, Br. 63, Makati, for
investigation, report and recommendation within ninety (90) days from receipt
of the records and recalled the records of A.M. Nos. MTJ-88-160, MTJ-88-244,
MTJ-89-322 and MTJ-89-344 from Judge Josefina Guevarra-Salonga and A.M. No.
MTJ-92-661 from Judge Job Madayag to be forwarded to Judge Julio R. Logarta.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Judge Logarta had terminated the investigation in A.M.
No. MTJ-89-4-371 and submitted his report dated 22 February 1993 finding
respondent judge culpable of charges Nos. 1, 3, 6, and 7, thus -</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">FINDINGS
ON:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>CHARGE NO. 1 - <u>Misappropriation of Public Funds (sic) Alias Writ
of Execution dated November 11, 1987 for Forfeiture of bonds in more than ten
(10) criminal cases</u>.  Complainants
cite the affidavit executed by the clerk of court of the Metropolitan Trial
Court of Parañaque, Jose Ison (Annexes "I" and "I-1" of
Reply of complainants) to the effect that out of the P12,000.00 paid by Interworld
Assurance Corporation for the confiscation of bonds in ten (10) criminal cases,
Judge Sebastian, thru Remedios de Leon, paid only P6,000.00 to the Judiciary
Development Fund, and that after the payment, the balance of P6,000.00 was not
paid by Judge Sebastian or Remedios de Leon.  This was also testified to by Jose Ison in open Court (t.s.n. pp. 11-18,
Oct. 21, 1992), affirming his affidavit of August 17, 1989, (Annex
"I").  Respondent judge in his
Rejoinder dated October 31, 1989, attempted to refute such charge by presenting
the affidavits (Exhs. "23" and "24") of officers of the
payor of P12,000.00 check, Interworld Assurance Corporation, which affidavits
state that they actually paid only P6,000.00 out of the P12,000.00 liability
they had incurred while Interworld's motion for reduction of bail bond was
still pending resolution before the sala of respondent judge.  The Court notes that no verification can be
made as to the truth of said affidavits (Exhs. "23" and
"24") that they (officers of Interworld) only paid P6,000.00, and not
their entire liability of P12,000.00 since the records, vouchers and motions
for bonds of Interworld 'solicited before Courts' were nowhere to be found per
certification (Exh. "22") of Mercedita Jaca of Interworld.  It cannot be shown beyond doubt that indeed
Interworld paid only P6,000.00, as the records of Interworld are no longer
available.  Thus, the testimony of Jose
Ison vis-a-vis the said affidavits of the officers of Interworld is more
credible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>CHARGE NO. 3 - <u>Falsification of Public Documents.</u>  Falsification of public document referred to
in this charge is the act of respondent judge in making it appear that the
trial fiscal participated in the dismissal of criminal cases numbers 65628-30
when the minutes for hearing of November 10, 1988 shows that no party appeared
in the hearing (Annex "G" of complainant).  The trial fiscal Rodolfo Tuazon, on February 28, 1989, filed a
manifestation (Annex "I" of the complaint) saying that he was not
'aware and have not participated nor have any knowledge that the case was
dismissed' citing the minutes of November 10, 1988.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In his Answer, respondent judge contended that 'it was a judgment
call on his part since he already called for the fiscal but the latter did not
come.' This investigating judge believes that notwithstanding these allegations
of respondent judge, it cannot be denied that there was misrepresentation on
his part in stating in his Order of November 10, 1988, that there was no
objection on the part of the trial fiscal, when in truth and in fact, as
manifested by said fiscal, he was not aware nor did not participate in such
proceeding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CHARGE <span style="">NOS. 6 </span>and
7:  (These charges are discussed

one Miss Ligaya P. Orogo, (Exh. "10") attesting to the fact that
respondent judge did not exact or charge any fee for solemnizing
marriages.  However, the testimony of
respondent's witness, Paz Zialcita, belies this, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q  </span>Is it not a fact Miss Witness that
whenever Judge Sebastian conducted marriages in Court, at times he collects
fees from the parties?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  No, sir.  The money to be paid is
given voluntarily.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q  </span>You said, he collects?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  Actually he does not collect, because for
instance, a couple is getting married in our branch, now when they asked us how
much is the pay, we tell them voluntarily, you just give whatever amount you
want to give.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q  </span>To whom is the amount given, Miss
Witness?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  To one of the staff, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q  </span>Who?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  It's either Charito or Imelda.  (tsn, dated Feb. 12, 199[2], p. 5)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anent Charge No. 7, for collecting monies from litigants to be
placed in a common fund, the testimony of respondent's witness, Paz Zialcita,
is relevant, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And what happened to the money given
as fees?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>The
respondent judge put it in our common funds</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And what happened to your common
fund?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
common funds was [sic] divided into [sic] employees who are low salaried
employees.  (tsn, dated Feb. 12, 199[2],
p. 5)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another is the affidavit (Exh. "11") executed by Paz
Zialcita, Josephine Junsay, Remedios de Leon, and Eulalia Meris attesting that there
indeed is a common fund which they collect, including respondent judge and
divided among the low salaried employees.  Also, in the same Exh. "11" it was stated, 'that the common
fund was thought of by Judge Sebastian; that it was at the instance and request
of Judge Sebastian.' Moreover, in Exh. "3," the affidavit executed by
spouses Apolinario and Milagros Sebastian, pars. 12 and 13 thereof, states as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">12. That as a
gesture of appreciation for his assistance in going to the bank, we gave Mr. Jose
Co the amount of P200.00 and offered Judge Sebastian the amount of P500.00
which he firmly declined;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">13. That we were
very insistent in giving this amount of P500.00. Judge Sebastian called in an
employee whose name we heard as Lalaine and instructed her to receive the
amount and allot P200.00 for the common fund and P300.00 for the replenishment
of kitchen supplies;</p>

<blockquote>Considering that these affidavits (Exh,
"3" and Exh. "11", Vol. I, pp. 95 and 105, respectively)
were marked as exhibits by respondent judge in his Answer (Vol. I - Record, p.
72, par. No. 13) in order to support his denial of the charge, his adoption of
said affidavits as part of his Answer is in effect an admission of the charges
Nos. 6 and 7, re:  existence of a common
fund.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

the penalty "as more cases against the same respondent judge are assigned
to (him) for investigation,"</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not in complete agreement with the recommendations of the
investigating judge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u>.  The
investigating judge has no authority to dismiss the six (6) administrative
cases filed against respondent judge for failure of the complainants and their
counsel to appear on two (2) scheduled hearings despite due notice.  It is this Court alone that can dismiss the
administrative charges against respondent judge.  The only authority of the investigating judge is to recommend
such appropriate action as may be proper on the basis of his findings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u>.  The
investigating judge also erred in dismissing A.M. No. MTJ-92-661, "Office
of the Court Administrator vs. Judge Jose R. Sebastian." If the
investigating judge had taken a hard look at the records of this case, he would

existed in charge No. 3, and for direct bribery involving an act not included

<p class="BODY">The direct bribery case stemmed from an accusation that
respondent Judge had asked P500.00 from parolee Leandro O. San Diego before the

checks as they are payable to the MeTC of Parañaque; that all the checks were
dishonored and eventually, only the sum of P6,000.00 was paid by the insurance
company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent judge thus deny the charge of Clerk of Court Jose Ison
that he pocketed P6,000.00.  The inquest
judge rejected this posture because 'the records, vouchers and motions of
Interworld were nowhere to be found.' The inquest judge found that there was no
sufficient evidence that Interworld only paid P6,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When this charge was first ventilated, the respondent judge
vehemently denied having received any checks from the Clerk of Court.  Thus, in his Answer dated June 9, 1989, (p.
61 of Rollo, Adm. Case No, 89-­4-371 MeTC), respondent judge, under oath, swore
that he never had in his custody in any manner any money and fund that does not
belong to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In <span style="">a </span>Rejoinder to
Reply dated October 31, 1989 (p. 258, Rollo), respondent judge, under oath
again categorically and absolutely denied the statement that Ison handed to
respondent any postdated check.  However, the Ombudsman discovered that these four (4) checks were
actually deposited with the personal account of the respondent judge.  This deposit was concealed by the respondent
judge in his sworn answer to the charge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent judge has not explained even when he testified before
the inquest judge why he concealed the fact of the deposit of these checks with
his account.  If two (2) of the checks
totalling P6,000.00 were dishonored and Interworld did not replenish the checks,
it has not been explained by respondent judge why no alias writ of execution
was issued against Interworld and why he allowed to pass the <u>final return</u>  of the sheriff, and even alleged in his
answer that the matter of the four (4) checks "had been finally disposed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The dishonor of the two checks issued by Interworld explains the
fact that respondent judge was able to turn over only the amount of P6,000.00
to the Judiciary Development Fund.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We are, however, gravely concerned over the fact that the respondent
judge lied to the investigator regarding his receipt of the Interworld checks
and the deposit of these checks in his bank accounts.  His Rejoinder dated October 31, 1989 whereby he presented the
affidavits of Interworld officers stating that only P6,000.00 was actually paid
out of the P12,000.00 liability betrays a deliberate effort to mislead the
investigator and conceal the true circumstances surrounding the issuance of the
checks.  The respondent judge not only
lied.  He employed others to distort the
truth.  There was <span style="">a </span>clear violation of the oath that he
took as a lawyer to 'do no falsehood nor consent to the doing of any in court.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, while respondent judge may not be criminally liable, he
violated Canon 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct, that '[a] judge should avoid
impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities.' If the checks
in question were not issued in the name of the Supreme Court, then they should
have been returned to Interworld with instructions that new checks be made
payable to the Supreme Court.  Respondent judge should not have taken it upon himself to cause the
encashment of said checks.  While he may
not have benefitted in this particular instance, his action casts doubts as to
the integrity of his judicial actions.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The charge of falsification

<blockquote>As to the charge of falsification of public document, it appears
that respondent judge did not intentionally falsify the Order of November 10, 198(8),
particularly, the portion thereof that states that the trial fiscal had voiced
no objection in the dismissal of Criminal Cases <span style="">Nos. </span>65628-30.  As found
by the Sandiganbayan in Crim. Case <span style="">No. </span>17271,
respondent judge had ordered his branch clerk of court, Mrs. Paz Zialcita, to
prepare a dismissal order in said cases, using the prepared form of such an
order.  That respondent judge signed the
Order of November 10, 1988, without checking the work done by his branch clerk
of court, does not make him liable for falsification in the absence of malice
or evil motive on his part.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At any rate, the Sandiganbayan noted that when the error was
brought to the attention of the respondent judge in a motion for
reconsideration filed by the prosecution, he immediately reinstated the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Court is in full accord with the conclusion of the
Sandiganbayan that the respondent judge did not maliciously intend to cause the
dismissal of Crim. Case Nos. 65628-30.  We also quote with approval the Sandiganbayan's observation regarding
respondent judge's actuations in this case:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">This lapse or indiscretion committed here by accused presiding
judge is, of course, uncalled for and unbecoming of, one whose position as a
magistrate of the law requires that he should always act with due care and
circumspection in the discharge of his duties.  In his hands lies the fate of litigants and parties whose liberty and
properties are placed at stake before him.  x x x</p>

<p class="2Q">To the mind of the Court, accused's liability here, if at all, lies
more within the threshold of a proper administrative proceeding(s) where the
question of whether he should be subjected to any disciplinary action for such
a careless actuation or patent indiscretion as shown herein may be determined.  x x x (Decision in Crim. Case No. 17271, p.
13)</p>

<p class="2Q">Respondent judge's failure to exert due diligence in handling Crim.
Cases Nos. 65628-30 similarly constitutes a violation of the Code of Judicial
Conduct, particularly the judge's duty to 'diligently discharge his
administrative responsibilities' (Rule 3.08, Canon 3, Code of Judicial Conduct)
and 'maintain professional competence in court management' (Id.).</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The charge of maintaining a
common fund (A.M. No. MTJ-89-4-371)<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<blockquote>We also find respondent judge administratively liable as regards the
charge that he has ordered his staff to collect money from litigants to be
placed in a so-called common fund.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is no doubt that such a common fund exists.  The staff of Branch 78, MTC, Parañaque,
attested to this fact in both their joint affidavit and their testimonies
before the investigating judge.  They
claim that respondent judge had thought of the common fund to help the
low-salaried employees of the court.  The money that goes into the common fund comes from the 'extra fees'
received by the sheriff and process servers, as well as the fees received by
the court stenographers.  The respondent
judge also contributes to the common fund.  At times, litigants and those married before respondent judge donate to
the common fund.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The keeping of a fund, financed directly by litigants and other
persons dealing with the Court and by 'extra fees' collected by the sheriffs
and process servers, such fund being at the disposal of the judge for the
private and personal benefit of the employees of his court, is, to say the
least, condemnable.  The respondent
judge did not only condone unlawful solicitation; he organized it as a part of
the day's work and as a ready source of income.  He thus defiled his noble office, indeed his entire Court, by
infecting it with desire for private gain and profit.  More tragic than that, Judiciary as a whole, before the people in
respondent's town, was placed in disrepute.  As observed in Junio vs. Judge Rivera, Jr., A.M. No. MTJ-91-565, August
30, 1993, a municipal judge is the most visible living representation of the
country's legal and judicial system. He is the judicial officer who on a
day-to-day basis deals with the disputes arising among simple, rural people who
comprise the great bulk of our population.  He is the judicial officer who comes into closest and most frequent
contact with our people.  The judiciary
as a whole and its ability to dispense justice are inevitably measured in terms
of the public and private acts of judges in the 'grass roots' level.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>We have previously dealt with acceptance by judges of benefits from
litigants.  In 'In Re:  Solicitation of Donations By Judge Benjamin
H. Virrey, MTC, Polillo, Quezon,' Adm. Matter No. 90-7-1159-MTCC, October 15,
1991, we ordered the dismissal from the service of the respondent judge for
having received a P3,000.00 'donation' for a 'Judiciary Welfare Fund' from an
accused in an illegal fishing case.  We
found the respondent judge guilty of unlawful solicitation under provisions of
Section 7(d) of R.A. 6714, which provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(d). Solicitation or
acceptance of gifts.  - Public Officials
and employees shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift,
gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan or anything of monetary value from any person
in the cause of their official duties or in connection with any operation being
regulated by or any transaction which may be affected by the functions of their
office.</p>

<blockquote>We found the act violative of Canons 1 and
2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct inspite of the justification, similar to that
made in Lecaroz vs. Garcia (107 SCRA 557), that the amount will be used to
refurnish respondent's office.  In
Lecaroz, we ruled that solicitation of donations for office equipment and
furniture from private persons is violative of the proper norm of judicial
behavior.  And, in the consolidated
decision in five administrative cases against Judge Luis D. Dictado, A.M. No.
RTJ-86-50, A.M. No. RTJ-88-222, A.M. No. RTJ-88-224, A.M. No. RTJ-89-320, A.M. No.
RTJ-89-389, June 28, 1993, we considered as grave misconduct the acceptance by
the Judge of the benefits of free bus rides from a litigant.  We have repeatedly stated the reasons why
the Judge must be above suspicion and beyond reproach.  As we said in Ubarra vs. Judge Mapalad, A.M.
No. MTJ-­91-622, March 22, 1993:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The Judiciary performs a very delicate function and a very sacred
duty - that of administering justice.  The Judicial Office demands that the incumbent should conduct himself in
such a manner as to merit the respect, reverence and confidence of the people
because a Judge is the visible representation of the law and, more importantly,
of justice.  For him, the people draw
their will and awareness to obey the law.  They see in him an intermediary of justice between two conflicting interests.  In a larger sense, the Judge must be at the
forefront of all efforts to preserve and enhance the public trust character of
a public office.  Anyone who cannot do
so should not be allowed to stay a minute longer in any judicial seat.</p>

<blockquote>The herein respondent judge did not just
engage in a solitary instance of solicitation.  He instituted a system of contribution by what he considered as his
public, the very people who seek justice in his court, of money for the use, as
unabashedly admitted, of the employees of the court.  His act constituted an utter disregard of the public trust
character of <span style="">a </span>public office.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Court Administrator recommends that appropriate
disciplinary sanctions be imposed upon respondent judge as warranted by his
misconduct.  Significantly, it observes
that violations of Canons 1 and 2 of the Code of Judicial Conduct are serious
offenses punishable by dismissal from the service; and that the infractions of
respondent taken together render him unfit to discharge the duties and
functions of a judge.  The Office of the
Court Administrator also recommends that the charges in all the other
administrative cases be dismissed for want of <span style="">evidence.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree <i><span style="">in </span>toto</i>
with the findings and recommendations of the Office of the Court Administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, there is one equally disturbing incident of
misconduct committed by respondent judge in A.M. No. MTJ-89-4-31.  In charge No. 2, he was accused of deriving
pecuniary benefit from his dismissal of Crim. Case No. 71396 without approval
of the Fiscal.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In that case, complainant received a check in the amount of
P35,000.00 as settlement of the civil liability of accused.  Upon request of complainant's daughter,
respondent judge readily deposited this check in his personal account.  After having received the cash, the spouses
contributed P500.00, P200.00 for the common fund and P300.00 for the
replenishment of kitchen supplies in respondent's court.  While there is no evidence to support the
charge against him, we however note that respondent judge finds nothing
unethical in his action.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> He
justified his behavior by claiming that complainants were barrio folks who
urgently needed cash but could not deposit or encash the check because they did
not have any bank account.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.  In
a joint affidavit dated 13 April 1989, complainant Apolinario Sebastian and his
wife, Milagros Sebastian, corroborated the statement of respondent judge that
they were in immediate need of cash.  But, they did not confirm his allegation that they did not have any bank
account.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Be that as it may, compassion is undisputably a commendable trait.  Yet, this sentiment should not be made to
prevail at the expense of the integrity of the court.  The Ombudsman correctly states that by reason of his duties and
functions, respondent judge is supposed to possess utmost prudence and/or
delicadeza in dealing with parties-litigants.  He should have declined or refused the request of Mrs. Milagros
Sebastian to avoid suspicion that he had some pecuniary interest in the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Granting that complainant did not have a bank account, respondent judge could
have required the insurer of the vehicle who issued the check to pay
complainant in cash or he could have advised them to open an account using the
check as initial deposit.  The affidavit
of complainants reveals that they did not get the money immediately but had to
go back to respondent judge after several days to get the cash.</p>

<p class="BODY">While every office in the government service is a public trust,
no position exacts a greater demand on moral righteousness and uprightness of
an individual than a seat in the judiciary.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, judges are strictly mandated to abide with the law, the Code of Judicial
Conduct and with existing administrative policies in order to maintain the
faith of our people in the administration of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge miserably failed to measure up to stringent
judicial standards.  His lack of candor,
gross misconduct and careless discharge of his administrative duties, and
worse, leading his subordinates to graft and corruption through unauthorized
solicitations from litigants and private parties, constitute a serious
liability to the administration of justice.  As rightly perceived by the Office of the Court Administrator, his
transgressions when considered together are grave and cannot be countenanced.

held that violations of the Code of Judicial Conduct are serious offenses which
