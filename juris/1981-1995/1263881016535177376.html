				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision dated October 1, 1981 rendered by the respondent Employees'
Compensation Commission <span style="">in E</span>CC
Case No. 1801, entitled "Expedita Librea, Appellant, versus Government
Service Insurance System (Ministry of Education and Culture), Respondent",
dismissing the claim of petitioner for death benefits under P.D. No. 626, as
amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is the widow of Eufronio Librea who served as a public
school teacher at the Division of Public Schools in Lipa City since July 1,
1948 until his death on July 28, 1980, after thirty-two (32) years of public
service.  From an ordinary classroom
teacher, Eufronio Librea successfully earned promotions to Assistant Principal
in 1959; Principal I in July, 1970; District Guidance Coordinator; and finally,
Division Physical Education Supervisor on November 14, 1974, his last post
before his death.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1978, Eufronio Librea began to complain of a gradual
loss of appetite, enlargement of the abdomen and severe anemia, often prompting
him to go on sick leave.  On July 2,
1980, he had to be admitted and confined at the Jimenez Memorial Hospital in
Lipa City, where his ailment was diagnosed as cirrhosis of the liver in its
terminal stage.  He died of that ailment
on July 28, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Jesus Inciong, the attending physician, affirmatively
certified that the illness may have been directly caused by the nature of the
duties of the deceased.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, petitioner filed a claim for death compensation
benefits with the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).  The claim was disapproved on October 27,
1980, based on the evaluation that the ailment which caused the death is not
work-connected.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 28, 1980, petitioner sent a letter requesting for a
reconsideration of the denial, attesting that the nature of her late husband's
work as a teacher and later as a supervisor was very strenuous physically and
mentally because being a physical education supervisor, he made it a point to
inspect regularly all districts in his assigned Division including those in the
remote barrios to attend to the physical education needs of the schools; that
in the process, he had to contend himself with adverse weather conditions,
extra-ordinary mental and physical fatigue due to the inaccessibility of some
of these places and the scarcity of transportation facilities; and finally,
that most of the time he was subjected to irregular meals and unhygienic eating
habits due to lack of facilities; that his activities were not confined to the
Division as he had to organize and participate in regional and national sports
meet which required hectic schedules -- which factors weakened his state of
health and rendered him susceptible to a fatal disease.  The GSIS, however, did not have a change of
heart and still denied the claim stressing that the cited conditions of work
are not causally connected to the illness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner sought a review of the denial before the respondent
Commission which affirmed the decision of the GSIS and dismissed the case.  Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved is whether the death of Eufronio Librea
due to cirrhosis of the liver is compensable.  Specifically, whether the work and nature of his duties increased the
risk of contracting the fatal disease.</p>

<p class="BODY">The etiology of cirrhosis of the liver is explained by the GSIS
Medical Services as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Portal cirrhosis or cirrhosis of the liver occurs chiefly in
males in late middle life.  Malnutrition
is believed to be a predisposing factor if not primary etiologic factor, and may
account for its prevalence <span style="">among
alcoholics.  This is a chronic disease
characterized by increased connective tissue that spreads from the portal
spaces, distorting liver architecture and impairing liver functions.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The denial of the claim by the GSIS is based on its conclusion
that there was no work-connection between the disease and the duties performed
by Eufronio Librea.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The conditions mentioned will not cause liver
cirrhosis.  Irregularity of meal intake
per se, will not cause liver cirrhosis.  Malnutrition as a predisposing, or a primary <span style="">etiology of cirrhosis is caused by </span><span style="">diet </span><span style="">deficient in
protein and specifically in choline and not as a result of meal irregularity
(Merck Manual, p. 1076 and Cecil's Textbook of Medicine, p. 881).  The possibility that nutritional deficiency
might </span>play an <span style="">important role was
proposed on the basis of frequent association of cirrhosis with alcoholism and
nutritional deficiency and of the favorable therapeutic response of patients
with cirrhosis to highly nutritious diet.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In affirming the denial, respondent Employees' Compensation
Commission reasoned as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Viewed in the light of the foregoing medical principles, we
cannot reverse the respondent GSIS's decision inasmuch as the genesis of the
said ailment is not causally-related to the decedent's work and working
conditions as physical education supervisor of the Ministry of Education and
Culture.  The decedent's duties such as
training of athletes and reaching barrio schools in Lipa City, although admittedly
abound with stress and strain, are too farfetched to have caused the
development of liver cirrhosis.  Similarly, irregular intake of meals contrary to the belief of
appellant, is not an accepted medical pre-disposing cause to the development of
liver cirrhosis."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, however, assails the denial of the claim as arbitrary
and contrary to the liberal spirit of the law on employees compensation,
contending that:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondent Commission's denial of the claim for compensation <span style="">on </span>the ground that the cause of death
of Eufronio Librea is not work-connected, is arbitrary and not in accord with
prevailing jurisprudence.  The
Commission completely ignored the nature and conditions of employment of the
decedent which could have predisposed him to contract the fatal ailment.  It is not disputed that the late Eufronio
Librea started in the government service some thirty-two (32) years ago free
from any physical or mental illness.  It
was only during the period of his employment that the symptoms of his illness
manifested which could <span style="">logically be
traceable to his employment.  It </span>is
likewise undisputed that decedent's employment exposed him to tremendous
physical and mental stress from the time he started as an ordinary teacher up
to the time of his <span style="">death.  During the few years that he was a </span>physical
education supervisor, the late Eufronio Librea experienced untold sufferings in
the course of his inspections of barrio <span style="">schools
to attend to the physical education activities of the schools.  More often than not, he was malnourished
because he was forced by circumstances </span>to eat <span style="">whatever available food there was.  This nutritional deficiency </span>might <span style="">have been the culprit </span>in <span style="">the
development of his liver ailment.  Again, in time of athletic meets, he had to prepare the teams for sports
competition which undoubtedly </span>involved <span style="">physical and emotional strain as well as exposure </span>to <span style="">adverse weather conditions.  All these employment factors might have
conspired to weaken the body resistance of the decedent and made him
susceptible </span>to <span style="">cirrhosis of the
liver.  At this </span>point, it <span style="">is to be reiterated that in the decision
itself, it recognized malnutrition to be a predisposing factor if not a primary
etiology factor in the </span>development <span style="">of
cirrhosis of the liver.  Certainly, it
need not be emphasized that the late Eufronio Librea was subjected to this risk
which is very common to his calling as a teacher.  x x x </span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We rule for the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the contention of petitioner that the death is compensable
since the fatal illness of her husband was contracted only after his long years
of service appears to be premised on the old rule of presumed compensability
under the prior compensation act, we find merit in the contention that the
duties and functions of the late Eufronio Librea as a teacher and later as a
district supervisor for thirty-two years may have rendered him susceptible to
contracting the fatal illness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule under the applicable law<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> i<span style="">s </span>that in order for the employee to be
entitled to sickness or death benefits, the sickness or<span style=""> </span>death resulting therefrom <span style="">must
</span>be, or must have resulted from either (a) any illness definitely
accepted as an occupation disease listed by the Commission; <span style="">or </span>(b) any illness caused by
employment subject to proof that the risk of contracting the same is increased
by working conditions.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> To
establish compensability under the second rule, known as the theory of
increased risk, it must be shown that an illness or the fatal disease is caused
by employment and the risk of contracting the same is increased by working
conditions.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the fatal disease suffered by the late
Eufronio Librea is cirrhosis of the liver.  Since it is not listed as an occupational disease, the claimant must
show that the risk of contracting the same is increased by the work or working
conditions of the deceased.  According
to the GSIS, the disease is common and occurs chiefly in males in late middle
life.  Malnutrition is believed to be a
predisposing factor if not a primary etiologic factor.  Respondent ECC explains that malnutrition as
a predisposing, or a primary factor in liver cirrhosis is caused by diet
deficient in protein and specifically in choline.  It is therefore clear that diet deficiency is an etiologic factor
of cirrhosis of the liver.</p>

<p class="BODY">The duties of the late Eufronio Librea as a teacher and later as
a physical education supervisor is admittedly fraught with mental and physical
strain as he had to supervise remote barrio schools in far-flung areas in the
district where he was assigned in the course of which he experienced missing
meals, if not hunger, and insufficient food.  His wife attests to this.  She
even went further and admitted that her husband was malnourished as a result of
the multifarious activities entailed in his work.  With these premises, to our mind there is sufficient basis for
the inference that he must have suffered nutritional deficiency, particularly
protein deficiency, which is a predisposing if not a primary factor in the
development of cirrhosis of the liver.  Indeed, even the attending physician is of the opinion that the fatal
illness must have been directly caused by the nature of the duties of the
deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner emphasized that during the last few years that her
husband was a physical education supervisor, Eufronio Librea experienced untold
sufferings in the course of his inspections of barrio schools to attend to the
physical education activities of the schools and that he was malnourished
because of scarcity of food <span style="">in </span>the
places he travelled to.  In addition,
her husband had to organize and prepare his Division for the national sports
meet.  All these may have indeed
weakened the state of health of Eufronio Librea and rendered him susceptible to
malnutrition and consequently to contracting cirrhosis of the liver.  It cannot be denied that there are times
when one is so engrossed in his duties to the point of overlooking the most
basic of needs such as nutritious food.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is </span>not fair to
speculate as the counsel for the GSIS seems to insinuate<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that the decedent's cirrhosis of the liver may have been contracted due to
alcoholism.  There is nothing in the
record to support this speculation, and in the absence of any finding to the
contrary, the late Eufronio Librea must be presumed not prone to taking
alcoholic liquor.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> On
the other hand, there is the consistent affirmation by the wife of the deceased
to the effect that in the course of performing the physically and mentally
demanding work of her deceased husband, the latter suffered food deficiency and
malnutrition.  It appears therefore that
only malnutrition could have caused the illness of the deceased, and in view of
the uncontroverted claim of the <span style="">wife </span>of
Librea that her husband suffered malnourishment in the latter stage of his
thirty-two years of devoted public service, it would be unfair to deny
compensability.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of common knowledge that our public school teachers are
among the lowly-paid public servants.  Thus, it is not farfetched to state that some teachers, especially those
with families to <span style="">support, </span>have
very little to spare for their own personal food.  Indeed, given our depressed economic realities, malnutrition is
not confined to children but even to adults and more so to family
breadwinners.  In the case at bar, the
wife of the late teacher admitted that her husband suffered nutritional
deficiency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing facts, it cannot be denied that there
is sufficient evidence to substantiate the claim that the work of Eufronio
Librea increased the risk of contracting the fatal disease.  This opinion is shared by the attending
physician who examined Librea at the hospital and who affirmatively certified
that the nature of Eufronio Librea's duties caused the development of cirrhosis
of the liver.  As <span style="">we </span>have already ruled, a physician's
report is the best evidence of work-connection of workmen's ailments and can be
the basis for an award even if the physician was not presented as <span style="">a </span>witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason for the rule is that the attending physician is in the best position
to judge possible causal relation between the illness and the work performed,
and normally, he would not make a false certification for the sake of a lowly
teacher.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The conclusion of the medical division of respondent Commission that there is
no proof of direct causal connection is not conclusive upon us.  We have ruled that findings of doctors and
chief medical officer of the GSIS and ECC who are not experts are not binding
on the Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commission should have appreciated Eufronio Librea's
more than thirty years of devoted public service, which earned him the
successive promotions to greater responsibilities, performing the strenuous and
demanding task of a public school teacher.  What the <span style="">Court </span>said in one
case bears reiterating:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . As the agents charged by the law to implement the social
justice guarantee secured by both the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions, respondents
should adopt a more liberal attitude <span style="">in
</span>deciding claims for compensation especially where there is some basis in
the facts in inferring a work-connection.  This should not be confused with the presumption of compensability and
the theory of aggravation under the Workmen's <span style="">Compensation Act.  While these
doctrines may have been abandoned under the new Labor Code (the constitutionality
of such abrogation may still be challenged), it is significant that the
liberality of the law, in general, still subsists.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">DISSENTING OPINION<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I regret that <span style="">I </span>have
to express my dissent <span style="">in </span>this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion tries to infuse elements of the defunct,
Workmens Compensation Act into the present scheme under the new Employees
Compensation Law.  Only Congress can do
this.  We have to interpret the law as
it now exists, not as it used to be or as we want it to become.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>two systems,
the former workmens compensation system and the present employees’ compensation
scheme are <span style="">quite </span>different.  The Court’s old rulings on the presumption
of compensability, controversion, adversarial procedure and levels <span style="">of </span>payment, among others, no longer
apply.  The new law uses the social
security principle in the handling <span style="">of </span>Workmens
Compensation not the old system where the employer and the employee oppose each
other and where so many presumptions in favor of the worker were evolved to
correct the imbalance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Raro</u> <u>v.</u> <u><span style="">Employees</span></u><span style=""> <u>Compensation</u> <u>Commission,</u> </span><u>et</u>
<u>al</u>, 172 SCRA 845 [1989], we stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The law, as it now stands requires the claimant to prove a
positive thing - that the illness was caused by employment and the risk of
contracting the disease is increased by the working conditions.  To say that since the proof is not available,
therefore, the trust <span style="">fund has the obligation
to </span><span style="">pay </span><span style="">is contrary to the legal requirement </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">proof must be adduced.  The
existence of otherwise non-­existent proof cannot be presumed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In Navalta v. Government Service Insurance System (G.R. No. 46684,
April 27, 1988) this Court recognized the fact that cancer is a disease of
still unknown origin <span style="">which strikes
people in all walks of life, employed or unemployed.  Unless it be shown that a particular form of cancer is caused by
specific working conditions (e.g. chemical fumes, nuclear radiation, asbestos
dust, etc.) we cannot conclude that it was the employment which increased the
risk of contracting the disease."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I am afraid that the evidence presented to show that cirrhosis of
the liver is caused by employment does not meet the standards required under
the new Employees’ Compensation Law.  We
are again engaging in presumptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot see how the work of a public school teacher difficult
though it may be, creates hazards which naturally cause the liver
sickness.  The disease from which the late
Mr. Librea suffered is one to which mankind in general is exposed or afflicted,
irregardless of the nature of his work.  (Erese v. Employees’ Compensation Commission, 138 SCRA 192, 199 [1985]).  It is not caused by the employment nor <span style="">is </span><span style="">the </span>risk of contracting cirrhosis of the liver increased by the
work of a teacher.</p>

<p class="BODY">I therefore vote to DENY the petition.</p>
