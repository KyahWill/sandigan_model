				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the orders of the
Court of First Instance of Manila (Branch XXXVII), dated February 16, 1979 and
May 2, 1979, which respectively dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the
complaint in Civil Case No.117708 and denied for lack of merit the motion for
reconsideration filed <span style="">by </span>the
plaintiffs therein—herein petitioners Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, <u>et</u>
<u>al</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 28, 1978, plaintiffs-petitioners filed with the res­pondent
Court of First Instance of Manila a complaint alleging, among other things,
that until their respective dates of retire­ment, retrenchment or resignation
between 1967 and 1978, plain<span style="">tiffs were
permanent and regular employees of the defendant — the herein private respondent
Philippine American General In­surance Company, Inc. (hereinafter referred to
as <span class="SpellE">PHILAMGEN</span>); that one of the rights and privileges
to which plaintiffs were entitled during their employment with the company was
sick leave with pay as provided in their collective bargaining agreements; that
at the time of their retirement, retrenchment, resignation or separation, their
accumulated sick leaves with pay were <span class="SpellE">uni­lateraly</span>
and arbitrarily declared forfeited by the defendant; that as a condition
precedent to the payment of their respective re­tirement, retrenchment or
resignation benefits, they were re</span>quired by the defendant to sign
mimeographed documents pur­porting to completely release and discharge the
defendant from all obligations, contractual and legal, to each of them; that
such releases or waivers are null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> for having been obtained under circumstances
indicative of undue influence, if not of outright compulsion; that all data
necessary for the determi­nation of plaintiffs' sick leaves and of the money
values thereof can be found only in records within the exclusive possession of
defendant; that defendant's refusal to give due compensation for their earned
and accumulated sick leaves have caused anxieties and inflicted upon them serious
deprivation and unnecessary suffering, mental and physical, for which they
should be allowed moral and exemplary damages within the sound discretion of
the court; and that they should likewise be allowed attorney's fees in the sum
of not less than P50,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
basis of the foregoing allegations, plaintiffs prayed -</p>

<blockquote>“a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that upon the authority of Rule 27 of the
Rules of Court an order be issued forthwith directing defendant upon service of
summons upon it to prepare and submit from pertinent records in its possession
and control (1) a list containing the names and addresses of all of defendant's
employees who have been retired, retrenched, resigned or separated; (2) the
inclusive dates of service of each retired, retrenched, resigned or separated
employee; (3) the latest position held or designation given to such employee;
(4) the latest basic salary given to such employee plus all allowances and
additions all of which, make up the gross salary; (5) the number of days of
accumulated sick leave with pay of each employee; and (6) the money value of
such accumulated sick leave with pay based on the latest gross salary of each
employee, furnishing a copy of such list to plaintiffs' counsel;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that after trial judgment be rendered
sentencing defendant and all persons claiming under it or acting in its behalf,
jointly and severally, to pay plaintiffs and all <span style="">other retired, retrenched, resigned employees of defendant company —</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Instead of filing an answer to the complaint, <span class="SpellE">PHILAMGEN</span>
filed a Motion to Dismiss, dated <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="11">November
 6, 1978</st1:date>, seeking the dismissal of the complaint on the following
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the court has no
jurisdiction over the nature of the action or suit under Art. 216 (now Art.
217) of the New Labor Code (P. D. No. 442, as amended); (2) that the claims set
forth in the complaint have been paid, waived, abandoned or otherwise

barred by Art. <span class="GramE">281 (now Art. 292) of the New Labor Code.</span></p>

Philippines, 61 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 346, and Articles 216 and 281 of
the New Labor Code (PD 442, as amended), that cases of the nature filed by the
plaintiffs against the defendant in this case, fall within the jurisdiction of
the National Labor <span style="">Relations </span>Commission,
and not the Court of First Instance, and that the allegations of the plaintiffs
that their action being<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for enforcement
of stipula­tions of the collective bargaining agreement and therefore is
incapable of pecuniary estimation and falls within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Court of First Instance is too general in scope and do not preclude the

money claims arising from the employer-employee relationship under said
collective bargaining agreement, the court grants the motion to dismiss for the
above-stated reasons.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Holding that the complaint is in the
nature of money claims arising from employer-employee relations, the lower
court ruled that the <span style="">same falls under
the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Commission and must therefore
be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has not raised this point but both private and
public respondents relied on Art. 216 of the New Labor Code as above quoted and
the Jacqueline Industries, Ruby International Corp. and Firestone Filipinas
Employees Association cases, <u>supra,</u> which applied said provision without
realizing that on <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1978</st1:date>,
long before the complaint in Civil Case No. 117708 was filed, Art. 216 had been
further amended by P. D. No. 1367 so that as re-numbered into Art. 217 it now
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 217. Jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters and the Commission.
- (a) The Labor Arbiters shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide
the following cases involving all workers, whether agricultural or
non-agricultural:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfair labor practice cases;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unresolved issues in collective bargaining,
including those that involve wages, hours of work and other terms and
conditions of employment; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All other cases arising from employer-em­ployee
relations duly endorsed by the Regional Di­rectors in accordance with the
provisions of this Code; <span class="GramE">Provided</span>, that the Regional
Directors shall not endorse and Labor Arbiters shall not entertain claims for
moral or other forms of damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission shall have exclusive appellate
jurisdiction over all cases decided by Labor Arbiters, compulsory arbitrators,
and voluntary arbitrators in appropriate cases pro­vided in Article 262 of this
Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing amendatory provision of P. D. No. 1367 re­moved
from the enumeration of cases falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Labor Arbiters of the National Labor Relations Commission "money claims
arising from employer-employee relations".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the jurisdiction of said Labor Arbiters <span style="">over cases arising from employer-employee
relations was ex­pressly limited to those which are "duly indorsed by the
Regional Directors in accordance with the provisions of (the) Code" which,
in no case, shall include "claims for moral and other forms of </span>damages''.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision of
P. D. No. 1367 (which took effect on May 1, 1978) to the subject complaint
(which was filed on August 28, 1978), and considering the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
prayed for therein-which consist mainly of the payment of the money values of
sick leaves, which defendant company allegedly refused to pay despite
obligation to do so, and of moral and exemplary damages to which plaintiffs are
allegedly entitled by virtue of said non­payment—We find respondent court's
dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction to be without support in
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted, furthermore, that said amendatory provision of
P. D. No. 1367 was even given retroactive application, for being curative in
nature, in the case of Garcia vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
(G. R. No. L-47629, May 28, 1979, 90 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 331) where
We ruled that the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City had jurisdiction over the complaint for actual, moral and exemplary
damages, allegedly arising from the plaintiff's dismissal as a manager of a
radio station, which was filed on August 2, 1976. This ruling was reiterated in
the more recent case of Calderon, Sr. vs. Court of Appeals (G. R. No. L-52235,
October 28, 1980, 100 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 459) where We held that
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> had jurisdiction
over the complaint for recovery of unpaid salaries, allowances, other re­imbursable
expenses, and damages, which was filed on March 3, 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the orders of the respondent court, dated <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1979</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1979</st1:date>, are hereby set aside; the
dismissed complaint is reinstated; and said court is directed to conduct
further proceedings for the disposition of Civil Case No. 117708.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
