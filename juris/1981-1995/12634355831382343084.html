<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The brief submitted by
the Office of the Solicitor General presents the established background facts,
thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">On February 3, 1988, Reynaldo Bartolo came home at about 5:00
o'clock in the afternoon from his work as tricycle driver (pp. 13-14, tsn, Feb.
22, 1989).  Upon arriving at his house
at Barangay Cagay, Roxas City, Bartolo asked his brother-in-law, Antonio Baes,
Jr. about his basketball (pp. 6, 11, 14, tsn, Id.).  Baes, Jr. answered that the ball was taken by appellant.  Bartolo then went to the basketball court
where appellant and his group were playing basketball.  Bartolo got the ball when it rolled to the
side of the court and left with it (pp. 15, 16, tsn, Id.).  Before Bartolo could leave the basketball
court, appellant said in a threatening voice, "Tan-awa galing karon kay
may matabo!" (You will see, something will happen by and by).  (p. 17, tsn, Id.).</p>

<p class="2Q">  At about 8:00 o'clock in
the evening of the same day, the house of Bartolo was stoned 3 times (pp. 18,
25, tsn, Id.).  After the third time of
stoning, Bartolo went down the house and went near the house of his brother
William (pp. 26-27, tsn, Id.; p. 3, tsn, Sept. 18, 1989).  Following Bartolo at a distance of 30 meters
was Antonio Baes, Jr. (pp. 28, 32, tsn, Feb. 22, 1989).  When Baes, Jr. came closer to Bartolo, he
asked Bartolo to return to the house (p. 2, tsn, Sept. 18, 1989).</p>

<p class="2Q">While Bartolo and Baes, Jr. were walking back to the house, there
was a sudden burst of gunfire and Bartolo just saw Baes, Jr. lying on the
ground with his face upward (pp. 3-4, tsn, Id.).  Ramon Belo who was in a nearby store saw appellant shoot the
victim (pp. 3-4, tsn, Feb. 14, 1990).  Bartolo then ran towards the house of his brother William and asked for
help.  William brought out his tricycle
and used it to bring Baes, Jr. to the St. Anthony Hospital (pp. 4, 5, tsn,
Sept. 18, 1989).  Baes, Jr. was taken to
the emergency room but a short time thereafter, one Dr. Billones pronounced him
dead.  Bartolo then went to the police
quarters and reported the matter for investigation (p. 5, tsn, Id.).  [pp. 1-2, Brief for the Plaintiff-Appellee;
p. 159, Rollo.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Dr. Rafael Almalbis, Jr.
of the Roxas City Health Office conducted a post-mortem examination on Baes,
Jr. and found two gunshot wounds, one on the forehead and the other on the
anterior aspect of the neck.  According
to him, the immediate cause of death was the first gunshot (intraÂ­crannial
hemorrhage secondary to gunshot wound), fired at close range.  The gun, he declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">... must have been fired at close-range which could be at a
distance of not closer than 6 inches but not farther than 24 inches from the
victim.  The assailant must have been in
front of the victim when the former fired the gun at the latter and it could be
possible that both of them were on standing position.  (p. 78, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant was convicted on the basis of his positive
identification as the assailant by Ramon Belo, which the trial court, in terse
telegraphic and a bit ungrammatical sentences, summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">While he was sitting just outside the store of Deling he saw the
accused Rudy Cayetano <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">standing </span>and
leaning against the fence of a yard.  Almost at the same moment he saw the victim, Antonio Baes, Jr.
arrive.  The victim was about to turn
towards the pathway leading to their house, he (victim) was shot by the
accused.  The victim then fell to the
ground.  He saw the gun which the
accused used.  It was a hand?gun
about 11 inches long.  The witness ran
away.  (pp. 9-10, RTC Decision; pp.
83-84, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on a sketch made in open court by Reynaldo Bartolo (Exh.
"C"), a picture is presented of the location of Bartolo's house and
the place where Baes, Jr. was shot.  Fronting Bartolo's house which faces east is a pathway, fenced on both
sides by bamboo trees (Tsn, Feb. 2, 1989, p. 24; Exh. "C-7").  This pathway <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">connects </span>to a cemented road south of Bartolo's house (Exh.
"C-6"), known as Cagay Road.  The place where Baes, Jr. was shot, which is marked by an "X"
on the sketch, is at the corner of the pathway and the Cagay Road (Tsn, Oct.
25, 1989, p. 4).  Baes, Jr. fell on the
cemented road, face upward.  This corner
is about 40 meters away from Reynaldo's house, forming a right angle, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and also the same distance to William
Bartolo's house, which is at Cagay Road.  It is 10 meters away from Deling's Store which is likewise located along
Cagay Road (Decision, p. 83, Rollo).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The testimony of Bartolo
on the circumstances prior to the killing was synthesized by the trial court in
the following manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">After hearing the 3rd thudding sound, the witness went down the
house.  When he left he saw the victim
Antonio Baes, Jr., lying on a hammock inside the house.  After touching the ground the witness
proceeded towards the house of his brother William.  He had gone already for about 30 meters from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span>house then he looked back.  He noticed that Antonio Baes, Jr., was
following.  The moon that night was
bright and was up in the sky at the position of 10:00 o'clock A.M. by the
sun.  (This could be about 60<span style="font-family:Symbol;mso-ascii-font-family:Arial;mso-hansi-font-family:
Arial;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol"><span style="mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol">Â°</span></span>
angle of the arc from 6:00 o'clock to 12:00 o'clock going clockwise.)</p>

<p class="2Q">After he noticed that Antonio Baes, Jr. was following him he
stopped and waited for him.  When
Antonio Baes, Jr. was approaching the witness the former said:  "Manoy, let's go back because we could
not find the man who threw the stones."</p>

<p class="2Q">The two nevertheless proceeded to the house of William Bartolo and
found it closed.  Everything was
quiet.  The two decided to go back home.
  Antonio Baes, Jr. was following about 9
meters behind the witness (Bartolo).  Suddenly, the witness heard an explosion.  He looked back and saw that his brother-in?law had
fallen.  (p. 81, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Reynaldo Bartolo further
testified:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened then?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
we were on our way back to our house Antonio Baes, Jr. was ahead of me and when
I turned back I heard a blast (lupok).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
the blast when I turned my face to my brother-in-law he was already lying in
the road facing upward.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
far were you then at your brother-in-law when you heard that burst?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>May
be from the witness stand to the main door of the Court estimating around 9
meters more or less.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Tsn, Sept. 18, 1989, p. 3.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Accused-appellant,
however, believes that his identity was not satisfactorily established due to
inaccuracies or inconsistencies in Belo's testimony.  It is argued that while Belo testified in court that he saw
accused-appellant leaning on the fence beside the Tiya Deling's Store and that
accused-appellant then shot Baes, Jr., while the latter was about to make a
turn towards his (Baes, Jr.'s) house, in his affidavit, Belo stated that
accused-appellant was squatting by the side of the pathway and when
accused-appellant noticed two persons walking following each other, he suddenly
stood up and aimed his gun at the man walking at the front.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Likewise, as against
Belo's testimony in court that he immediately ran away after he saw Baes, Jr.
fall to the ground, Belo stated in his affidavit that he even asked permission
from Tiya Deling (the owner of the store) that he be allowed to pay his debt
the following day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The inconsistencies,
however, refer to minor details and do not affect Belo's positive
identification of accused?appellant as the assailant.  Inconsistencies in the testimony of
prosecution witnesses do not affect their credibility for as long as there is
no disagreement as to the identity of the malefactor.  Indeed, more convincing is the testimony with a bit of
inconsistency than memorized perjury (<u>People vs. Segwaben</u>, 194 SCRA 239
[1991], citing <u>People vs. Jutie</u>, 171 SCRA 586 [1989], at p. 241).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Accused-appellant's
defense is alibi, that is, that he was asleep in his house at the time of the
accident.  He denied his presence at the
basketball court and disowned any motive to kill Baes, Jr.  To corroborate his testimony, he presented
his sister, Lucia Panis, and his father, Rosendo Cayetano.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We have consistently
ruled that alibi is a weak defense and can only be accepted upon the clearest
proof that the accused was not or could not have been at the scene of the crime
when it was consummated (<u>People vs. Peralta</u>, 193 SCRA 9 [1991]), more so
if the alibi is established by the accused himself and his relatives, and not
by credible persons (<u>People vs. Solis</u>, 195 SCRA 405 [1991]; <u>People
vs. Flores</u>, 195 SCRA 295 [1991]).  Further, the ocular inspection of the place conducted by the trial court
in the presence of the prosecution, defense counsel, Reynaldo Bartolo, and
accused-appellant, revealed that accused-appellant's house is located near the
basketball court and is only 150 meters away from the place where Baes, Jr. was
shot, following a straight line, or 200 meters, by a circuitous route.  There was, therefore, no physical
impossibility for accused-appellant to have been at the scene of the crime at
the time it was committed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On the absence of motive,
again, we have ruled that motive is immaterial where the identity of the
accused has been established (<u>People vs. Gabatin</u>, 203 SCRA 225 [1991]; <u>People
vs. Ballinas</u>, 202 SCRA 519 [1991]; <u>People vs. Pigon</u>, 173 SCRA 607
[1989]).  Neither is motive an essential
element of murder for which reason it does not have to be proved by the
prosecution (<u>People vs. Catalina Lorioda, et al</u>., G.R. No. 93240, January
22, 1993).  Motive in the case at bar
becomes relevant only to determine the nature of the crime committed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In convicting
accused-appellant, the trial court used treachery (employing nighttime to
ensure his sudden unprovoked attack) and the presence of the generic
aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation without any mitigating
circumstance to qualify the crime to murder (<u>People vs. Aguilar</u>, 88
Phil. 693 [1951]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We agree that the
presence of treachery qualified the crime to murder.  However, we do not believe that there was evident
premeditation.  Mere threats unsupported
by other evidence which would disclose the true criminal state of mind of the
accused do not justify a finding of evident premeditation.  The rule is that the qualifying circumstance
of premeditation is satisfactorily established only if it is proved that the
accused had deliberately planned to commit the crime, and had persistently and
continuously followed it, notwithstanding the passage of ample time to allow
his conscience to overcome the determination of his will, if he had so desired,
after meditation and reflection (<u>People vs. Bautista</u>, 79 Phil. 652
[1977]; <u>People vs. Sarmiento</u>, 8 SCRA 263; <u>People vs. Edna Cordero</u>,
G.R. No. 97229, January 5,1993).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">There being no aggravating
or mitigating circumstances, the applicable sentence, pursuant to <u>People vs.
MuÃ±oz</u> (170 SCRA 107 [1989]; <u>People vs. Barba</u> (203 SCRA 436 [1991]),
is the medium period of the penalty prescribed by Article 248 of the Revised
Penal Code which is <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> which the trial court,
however, equated with life imprisonment or <u>cadena</u> <u>perpetua</u>; and
conformably with recent rulings, the civil indemnity should be increased to
P50,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, the appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED
with the following modifications:  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">(1) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
