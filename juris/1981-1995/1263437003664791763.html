				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Nemesio P. Macutob is a Staff Assistant III in Branch 16 of the
RTC of Tangub City.  On January 25,
1992, Atty. Priscilla T. Hernandez, Clerk of Court of the said Branch 16,
issued Office Memorandum 92-05 authorizing Macutob "… to receive payments
for docketing and other court fees and to remit the same to authorized Supreme
Court depositories."</p>

<p class="BODY">Macutob was audited for the period October 23, 1992 to June 15,
1993 by Nila R. Pintacasi, State Auditor III.  He was found to have incurred a shortage of P8,637.00.  On June 24, 1993, Auditor Pintacasi sent him

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Macutob received the letter on June 28,
1993, and immediately remitted the P8,637.00 to this Court.  In his letter of June 30, 1993 to Auditor
Pintacasi, Macutob explained his cash shortage as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Due to the pressure of my work as Clerk III of the Regional
Trial Court, 10th Judicial Region, Branch 16, Tangub City, and my lack of
knowledge and experience on collection and handling of cash the first time I
have done in my life I was rattled and confused on my actual amount collected
as compared to the amount on the receipts I issued when I was notified of the
coming examination.  Due to the haste,
rushness, and tension of what had happened there were entries in the official
receipts that were inadvertently entered."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The matter was brought to the attention of the Hon. Dominador
Borje, Executive Judge of the RTC, 10th Judicial Region, Br. 16, Tangub City by
Auditor Pintacasi in a letter dated July 9, 1993.  Auditor Pintacasi stated in the letter that "the shortages
were done through alterations of duplicate receipts." Judge Borje referred
the said letter to the Office of Court Administrator in a 1st Indorsement dated
July 12, 1993.  On August 9, 1993,
Deputy Court Administrator Juanito A. Bernad in a 2nd Indorsement required
Macutob to file his Comment to the letter, <i><u>viz</u></i>:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>"Respectfully referred to <b><span style="">MR. NEMESIO P. MACUTOB</span></b><span style="">,
</span>Staff Assistant III, RTC, Branch 16, Tangub City for COMMENT, the within

Borje, of same court, relative to the audit report of City auditor Nila R.
Pintacasi finding a shortage of P8,637.00 in the accounts then held by you as
the designated Court Collection Officer.  It was discovered that ‘shortages incurred were done through alterations
of duplicate receipts.’ You are advised to secure the services of a lawyer in
the preparation of your comment which shall serve as basis for whatever action
this Court may take under the premises.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Return of all these papers with the required comment, within ten
(10) days from receipt hereof, is hereby directed.  Failure to comply herewith shall be deemed a waiver of your right
to be heard and to challenge the allegations against you.  <u><span style="">For
</span>strict compliance</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Very truly yours,</blockquote>

<blockquote>(SGD). <b>JUANITO A. BERNAD<o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Deputy Court
Administrator"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment dated August 27, 1993, Macutob offered a different
explanation as to how he incurred his shortage, <i><u>viz</u></i>:</p>

<blockquote>"Just recently, a boardmate of mine had confessed to me of
what he had done to my collections and official receipts which I kept inside
may apparador inside my room in our house at Maloro, Tangub City.  It is indeed with regret that he just
confessed his guilt after a while when his conscience could no longer bear and
too late for me to discover it and explain.  It is always my practice to bring with me the official receipts and my
collections at home everyday since I was assigned the task to receive
collections to be sure that nothing will happen to it keeping in mind the
dilapidated wood bars of our office and the repair undergoing at that
time.  This boardmate have taken
advantage of the absence of our other co-boardmate and of my absence in <span style="">the </span>house when I was at the public
market buying for my daily consumption.  It is during this time that with the used of an improvised key he was
able to open my room and again with the used of an improvised key he opened my
drawer of my apparador where my collections and official receipts were
found.  That from his confessions I
learned that he took some cash from my collections and to hide his crime, he
erased the figures in my official receipts and place instead the figures which
is the result after deducting the amount which to took.  I was not able to notice this immediately
because the penmanship in the official receipts appeared to be similar to
mine."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the conflicting explanations of Macutob utterly
insufficient to justify his shortage of P8,637.00.  His first explanation that his shortage was incurred because he
was new to the job or due to inexperience lacks merit.  He was assigned the duty "to receive
payments of docketing and other court fees..." as far back as January 25,
1992.  He was audited for the period
October 23, 1992 to June 15, 1993.  Between January to October 1992, is enough time for him to be able to
discharge his additional job with more prudence.  In truth, there is nothing in the records that he called the
attention of his supervisors in office as to his alleged inexperience and
inability to discharge the new duty assigned to him.  His second explanation deserves less credence.  It is clearly an afterthought.  His boardmate who allegedly altered his
receipts of collections is obviously an invention.  His identity is unrevealed.  It is also incredible that he was unable to notice the alterations in
the receipts.  In sum, his two
explanations were patently contrived to hide his dishonesty.  The stubborn fact as found by Auditor
Pintacasi is that the "shortages were done through the alterations of
duplicate receipts." Such acts of alterations committed on several
occasions and in a long span of time completely negate Macutob's innocence.</p>
