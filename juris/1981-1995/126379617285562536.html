defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In alleg­ing that the
accused:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'had in his possess­ion,
custody and control a Smith and Wesson Cal. 38 revolver with Serial No. C-61898

being charged with several distinct and separate offenses as defined in Section
1 of P.D. 1866.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The inform­ation simply
describes the mode or manner by which the crime or the violation of Section 1,
PD 1866 was committed which is allowed under existing laws and jurisprudence (<span class="SpellE">Ko</span> Bu Lim v. Court of Appeals, 118 SCRA 573, 581-582

merit in the second ground invoked by the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The so-called inconsistent stand adopted by </span>the
prosecution is not a ground for quashing the information which is valid on its
face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the information herein
has the ad­ditional allegation that the accused has <u>no</u> <u>permit</u> for
the firearm in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A person may
have the license to possess firearm, but may not necessarily have the necessary
permit to carry the same outside his home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The so-called inconsistency therefore, granting <span class="SpellE">ar­guendo</span>,
that there is, goes on as far only as the matter of license is concerned, and
does not cover the matter of permit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The third ground is likewise without merit, not because there has
been no conviction or acquittal yet in the two cases pending before this court,
as the prosecution contends, but because the offense charged in the two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, albeit, based on the same act or incident,
are entirely dif­ferent offenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One is
for homicide penalized under the Revised Penal Code, the other is for violation
of Section 1 of PD 1866 which is a special law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For double jeopardy to come into play, the subsequent indictment must be
for the same offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except in the case
(then) of an act being punished by a law and an ordinance in which event <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>conviction
or ac­quittal under either constitutes a bar to another prosecution, there must
be a show­ing of the crimes charged being identical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough that the complaint or
information is based on the same act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x' </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>,

under the second information petitioner could, if he failed to plead double
jeopardy, be convicted of the same act charged in the first case in which he
had already been acquitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In ruling in
the affirmative, the Court held that under certain conditions, one offense may
include the other, and accordingly, once placed in jeopardy for one, the plea
of double jeopardy may be in order as regards the other, as in the Diaz case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the other grounds for a motion to quash raised by the
petitioner, there is no basis for the claim that the information in Criminal
Case No. 19350 charging <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">petitioner </span>with
alleged possession of firearms and ammunitions used <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in </span>the commission of homicide <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">as </span>defined and punished under Section 1 of P.D. 1866 charges
more than one offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> case (<u>supra</u>) involving almost identical
circumstances to the case at bar except as to the attachment of jeopardy in the
former, the Court in ruling that there is only one offense charged, held that
parricide is an essential ingre­dient of qualified illegal possession of
firearm which is punishable by death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, in the instant case the offense of illegal possession of
firearms is qualified by its being used to commit homicide and subjects
petitioner if found guilty thereof to death penalty which under the new Consti­tution
has been reduced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the allegation in the information that
the unlicensed firearm was used in the commission of the crime of homicide
against the person of one <span class="SpellE">Generoso</span> Miranda III does
not charge petitioner in the same information with the separate offense of
homicide, but simply describes the mode or manner by which the violation of
Section 1 of P.D. 1866 was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Neither is there a basis
for petitioner's claim that his criminal liability for the offense charged in
the inform­ation in Criminal Case No. 19350 has been extinguished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Article 89 of</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the
Revised Penal Code enumerates the causes that totally extinguish criminal
liability as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the death of
the convict, as to the personal penalties; </span>and as to pecuniary
penalties, liability therefore is extin­guished only when the death of the
offender occurs before final judgment; (2) service of the sentence; (3)
amnesty, which completely extinguishes the penalty and all its effects; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(4) </span>absolute pardon; (5) prescription
of the crime; (6) pres­cription <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">of </span>the
penalty; (7) the marriage of the offended woman, as provided in Article 344 of
the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In the case at bar, it is
evident that criminal liabi</span>lity in the homicide case has not been
extinguished under any of the above-mentioned causes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That petitioner entered a plea of not guilty
to the offense charged in Criminal Case No. 17587 which alleged that he
committed homicide with the use of a licensed firearm is immaterial as such
circumstance does not operate to extinguish his criminal liability for the
offense charged in Criminal Case No. 19350.</p>

right of the accused to speedy justice while at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

and convict, a joint hearing of the two cases could be conducted so that the
