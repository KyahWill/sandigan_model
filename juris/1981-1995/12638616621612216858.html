<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence upon which the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
based its finding of guilt is summarized by it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>On December 14, 1979, accused <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>, was the Deputy Sheriff of the Court of First
Instance, Branch IV, La Union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Civil
Case No. 300 was filed in the Municipal Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, La Union, presided over by
Judge Jose Quesada, wherein the plaintiff was Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Casilla</span>
and the defendant therein was <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, for a sum of money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On September 14, 1979, Judge Quesada rendered
a decision in said case and ordered the </span>defendant to pay the sum of
P300.00 as surveyor's fee, to respect the boundaries of their respective lands
as relocated by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">surveyor and to pay
P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for actual expenses and moral as well as
exemplary </span>damages (Exhibit A).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By
virtue of said decision, Judge Quesada issued a writ of execution and ordered
one policeman from the <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> INP Station to
escort Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gapasin</span></span><span class="GramE"> to enforce said writ of execution and to seize the goods and
properties of defendant <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> (Exhibits B and C).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After accused <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>
had <span class="GramE">effected</span> said writ of execution, he executed an
affidavit stating among others that the writ of execution was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">properly served (Exhibit D).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among the properties levied upon were two (2)
<span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> ages 5 and 8, which were later sold to <span class="GramE">accused</span> Pedro <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, being the
highest bidder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that said <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> had no papers of ownership, accused <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> executed an Affidavit of Sale on December 17, 1979
which was used as a basis for the transfer of said <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> who, in turn, paid the amount of
P3,300.00 to <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> and which the latter duly
receipted (Exhibits E and F).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On 18,
1979, accused <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> wrote a letter to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Cawed, counsel for </span>plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Casilla</span>, of the Citizens Legal Assistance Office of San
Fernando, La Union, informing him that the writ of execution was already
accomplished (Exhibit G).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> had also hired a jeep in loading said <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> for which he paid the amount of P300.00 duly
acknowledged by its driver Loreto <span class="SpellE">Gundran</span> and which
amount was also used in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">paying persons

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was a buyer of <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> and, therefore, should know that they are covered
by Certificates of Ownership registered in the Local Civil Registry does not
indicate conspiracy in a crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> were sold to him by the Sheriff.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court said that he did not even bother to verify the real
owners of the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is inaccurate as <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
demanded from <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> the said certificates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>, however,
informed him that he could not show the papers as he (<span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>)
could not locate them among the voluminous records kept in the Local Civil
Register of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, La Union. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, May 27, 1982, p. 15).</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead, <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> issued him an
Affidavit of Sale duly signed by the former with Judge <span class="SpellE">Josue</span>
M. Quezada as the subscribing officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Exhibits 2, 2-A, 2-B).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">is </span>no evidence
to show that the appellant did not act on the reasonable belief that <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> was engaged in the regular performance of his duty
as Deputy Sheriff, (See Rule 131, sec. 5(m) of the Rules of Court) or that the
Judge would not administer the oath to something irregular or illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second fact relied upon by the lower court was that <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was present at the time <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
was objecting to the levy being made by <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> and
therefore he knew that the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> were not owned by
<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was present at that
time, he only witnessed <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> telling <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> not to take the two <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>
or else something will happen to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> did not reveal at that time that he was not th<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">e</span> real owner of the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> informed <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> then
that if he wanted the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> back, he had only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to </span>pay back
his obligation. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, March <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">4, </span>1982, pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">37-38). It </span>is not unusual for owners of property being levie<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">d</span> upon or seized to tell the sheriff
that the property does not belong to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For a buyer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">being sold </span>by the sheriff not to pay
much attention <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>said
protestations cannot prove conspiracy in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">scheme </span>to commit a crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rivera Camacho and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cales</span>
presented themselves to <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> as the real owners of
the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> only after <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>
was already alone and the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> had already been
sold to Castaneda.</p>

<p class="BODY">If Castaneda advanced or loaned money to the sheriff for the hire
of a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to
</span>transport seized goods or items, this is not necessarily an indication
of awareness that the sheriff was up to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">no
</span>good, much less positive conspiracy in the act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Regarding the alleged inadequacy in price, we
have to bear in mind that the appellant was not buying property from the owners
but from the sheriff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment debt
was only P3<span class="GramE">,300.00</span> and that was all about which
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> appeared to be concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b><span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>the
petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
Castaneda is ACQUITTED on grounds of reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

is accordingly modified to the extent of the appellant's acquittal.</p>
