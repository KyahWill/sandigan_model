<p class="BODY">1) to consider their “physical or bodily presence” in the country

fact that they were not ‘residents’ of the Philippines immediately before their
employment by the U.S. Government at <span class="SpellE">Subic</span> Naval Base

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The provision under </span>which
the petitioners claim exemption, on the other hand, is contained in the
Military Bases Agreement between the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“2. No national of the United States serving in or employed in the
Philippines in connection with construction, maintenance, operation or defense
of the bases and reside in the Philippines by reason only of such employment,
or his spouse and minor children and dependents, parents or her spouse, shall
be liable to pay income tax in the Philippines except in regard to income
derived from Philippine sources or sources other than the US sources.”<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners claim that they are covered by this exempting
provision of the Bases Agreement since, as is admitted on all sides, they are
all U.S. nationals, all employed in the American Naval Base at <span class="SpellE">Subic</span> Bay (involved in some way or other in “construction,<span style=""> maintenance, operation or defense” thereof),
and receive salary <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> exclusively and from no
other source in the Philippines; and it is their intention, as is shown by the <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> evidence, to return to the United States on
termination of their employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That claim had been rejected by the Court of <span style="">Appeals with the </span>terse statement that
the Bases Agreement “speaks of exemption from the <i>payment</i> of income tax,
not from the <i>filing</i> of the income <span style="">tax
returns * *.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the Bases Agreement very plainly identifies the
persons NOT “liable to pay income tax in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
except in regard to income derived from Philippine sources or sources other
than the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sources.” They are the persons in <span class="GramE">whom</span> concur the
following requisites, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) <span class="GramE">nationals</span> of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> serving in or employed in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</p>

<p class="BODY">2) <span class="GramE">their</span> service or employment is “in
connection with construction, maintenance, operation or defense of the bases;”</p>

<p class="BODY">3) <span class="GramE">they</span> reside in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by reason only of such employment; and</p>

<p class="BODY">4) <span class="GramE">their</span> income is derived exclusively
from “<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sources.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, there is no question (1) that the petitioners are U.S.
nationals serving or employed in the Philippines; (2) that their employment is
“in connection with construction, maintenance, operation or defense” of a base,
<span class="SpellE">Subic</span> Bay Naval Base; (3) they reside in the Philippines
by reason only of such employment since, as is undisputed, they all intend to
depart from the country on termination of their employment; and (4) they earn
no income <span style="">from Philippine <span class="GramE">sources</span> or sources other than the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> sources.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, by the explicit terms of the Bases Agreement, none of them </span>“<span style="">shall be liable to pay income tax in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> *<span class="GramE">* .”</span> Indeed, the
petitioners’ claim for exemption pursuant to this Agreement had </span>b<span style="">een sustained by the Court of Tax Appeals
which set aside and cancelled the assessments made against said petitioners by
the BIR for deficiency income taxes for the taxable years 1969-1972.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The decision of the Court of Tax Appeals to

<p class="BODY">But even if exempt from <i><span style="">paying
income tax</span></i><span style="">, </span>said
petitioners were, it is contended by the respondents, not excused from <i><span style="">filing income tax returns</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>For
the Internal Revenue Code (Sec. 45, <i><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">) </span>requires the filing of an income tax
return also by any “alien residing in the Philippines, regardless of whether
the gross income was derived from sources within or outside the Philippines;”
and since the petitioners, although aliens residing within the Philippines, had
failed to do so, they had been properly prosecuted and convicted for having
thus violated the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">“What the law requires,” states the challenged judgment of the
Court of Appeals, “is merely physical or bodily presence in a given place for a
period of time, not the intention to make it a permanent place of abode.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is on this proposition, taken in the light
of the established facts on record to the effect that almost all of the
appellants were born here, repatriated to the US and to come back, in the
latest in 1967, and to stay in the Philippines up to the present time, that
makes appellants resident aliens not merely transients or sojourners which
residence for quite a long period of time, coupled with the amount and source
of income within the Philippines, renders immaterial, for purposes of filing
the income tax returns as contra-distinguished from the payment of income tax,
their intention to go back to the United States.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Each of the petitioners does indeed fall within the letter of the
<span class="SpellE">codal</span> precept that an “alien residing in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>”
is obliged “to file an income tax return.” None of them may be considered a <i><span style="">non-resident alien</span></i><span style="">, </span>“a mere transient or sojourner,” who
is not under any legal duty to file an income tax return under the Philippine
Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is made clear by Revenue
Regulations No. 2 of the Department of Finance of <st1:date year="1940" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1940</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
which lays down the relevant standards on the matter:</p>

<blockquote>“An alien actually present in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
who is not a mere transient or sojourner is a resident of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for purposes of income tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether he
is a transient or not is determined by his intentions with regards to the
length and nature of his stay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere
floating intention indefinite as to time, to return to another country is not

<blockquote><span style="">“ *
* </span>after having expressly recognized that petitioners need not pay income
tax here, there appears to be no logic in requiring them to file income tax
returns which anyhow would serve no practical purpose since their liability on
the amounts stated thereon can hardly be exacted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more practical view, taking <span style="">into account policy considerations that
prompted the Government of the Republic of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> to exempt the petitioners, as well as other
American citizens similarly situated, from the payment of income tax here, is
to recognize the lesser act of filing within the exemption granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is simply being consistent with the
reason behind the grant of tax-exempt status to petitioners.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Pointing
out further to what they consider </span><span style="">“</span><span style="">the administrative implementation of that
(tax-exemption) provision (of the Bases Agreement) by both governments for
about 22 years (which did not require the filing of income tax returns by
American citizen-employees holding 9-A special visas like petitioners), and to
“the higher plane of political realities which prompted the Philippine
Government to partially surrender its inherent right to tax,” petitioners
submit that “the particular problem involved in these cases is a matter that
has to find solution and ought to be dealt with in conference tables rather
than before the court of law.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Quite apart from the
evidently distinct and different character of the </span><i>requirement to pay
income tax</i> <span style="">in contrast to the </span><i>requirement
to file a tax return</i>, <span style="">it appears
that the exemption granted to the petitioners by the Bases Agreement from
payment </span>of income tax is not absolute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By the explicit terms of the Bases Agreement, it exists only as regards
income derived from their employment “in the Philippines in connection with construction,
maintenance, operation or defense of the bases;” it does not exist in respect
of other income, i.e., “income derived from Philippine sources or sources other
than the US sources.” Obviously, with respect to the latter form of income,
i.e., that obtained or proceeding from “Philippine sources or sources other
than the <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sources,” the petitioners, and all other American nationals who are residents
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
are legally bound to pay tax thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, so that American nationals residing in the country may be relieved
of the duty to pay income tax for any given year, it is incumbent on them to
show the Bureau of Internal Revenue that in that year they had derived income
exclusively from their employment in connection with the U.S. bases, and none
whatever “from Philippine sources or sources other than the US sources.” They
have to make this known to the Government authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not in the first instance the latter’s
duty or burden to make unaided verification of the sources of income of
American residents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty rests on
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
nationals concerned to invoke and <i>prima facie</i> establish their tax-exempt
status.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot simply be presumed
that they earned no income from any other sources than their employment in the
American bases and are therefore <span style="">totally
</span>exempt from income tax.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
situation is no different from that of Filipino and other resident
income-earners in <span style="">the </span>Philippines
who, by reason of the personal exemptions and permissible deductions under the
Tax Code, may <span style="">not </span>be liable to
pay income tax year for any particular year; that they are not liable to pay
income tax, no matter how plain or irrefutable such a proposition might be,
does not exempt them from the duty to file an income tax return.</p>
