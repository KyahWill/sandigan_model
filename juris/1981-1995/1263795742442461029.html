of respondent Court of Appeals, dated 15 November 1977, in CA-G.R. no. 49495-R
which affirmed the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch
XXIII, Civil Case no. 57861, and its resolution, dated 6 January 1978, denying
the petitioners' motion for reconsi­deration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts derived from the records are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 January 1954, Pablo Encabo formally applied with the Land
Estates Division, Bureau of Lands, to purchase a parcel of land designated as
Lot 1, Block 4, Plan Psd-24819, which was a part of the Tuason Estate purchased
by the government pursuant to the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 539, for
resale to <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> tenants or occupants who are qualified to own
public land in the Philippines.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Encabo, through petitioner Cirila Vicen­cio,
supposedly as "agent", came to an agreement with Josue Quesada
transferring rights over the lot to the latter, con­ditioned on approval by the
Land Tenure Administration (LTA, for short).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The husband of Cirila Vicencio (Juanito Cariño) is a relative of
Quesada; Cirila Vicencio is also a "comad­re" of Quesada's wife.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The transfer of rights by Encabo to Quesada was not put in writing but payment
of the price for the rights transferred was evidenced by receipts (Exhi­bits
"A" and "B") on which Cirila Vicencio signed as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 July 1957, the LTA, unaware of the transfer of rights by
Encabo to Quesada, adjudicated the lot in favor of Encabo, and the LTA and
Encabo signed an "Agreement to Sell" (Exh. "G-1").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>LTA later came to know about the
"transfer" of rights from Encabo to Quesada.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It disapproved the same on the ground that
Quesada was not qualified to acquire the lot because he is already a lot owner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
However, before the LTA's disapproval of the transfer of Encabo's rights to
Quesada, the latter had entered into possession of the lot in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Quesada had also allowed Cirila Vicencio to
enter into possession and occupancy of the same lot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In November (undated) 1958, Encabo executed a Deed of Sale of
House and Transfer of Rights (Exh. "D-1"), purpor­tedly conveying to
herein petitioners (Juanito Cariño and Cirila Vicencio), his rights over the
lot, subject to appro­val of the LTA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
17 December 1958, Encabo wrote a letter to the LTA (Exh. "1")
requesting permission to transfer his rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Another such request was made on 20 April 1960 (Exh. "2") but
without making mention of who the transferee would be, just like in the first
letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On 18 April 1960, however,
Encabo and Quesada executed a document wherein the latter purportedly resold to
the former (Encabo) the house and the rights over the lot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 April 1960, Juanito Cariño filed a petition with the LTA
seeking approval of the transfer to herein petitio­ners of rights to the lot in
question on the basis of the Deed of Sale of House and Transfer of Rights
executed by Pablo Encabo (Exh. "D-1").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition of Juanito Cariño was docketed
as LTA Case no. 490, to which respondent Pablo Encabo objected and filed an
Answer in opposition thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Essentially, both parties in LTA Case no. 490 (Encabo and the
spouses Cariño) claimed the right to purchase the lot in question from the
LTA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the submission of their respective
pleadings and evidence, the LTA rendered a deci­sion holding that the <u>status</u>
<u>quo</u> should be maintained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
reasoned out that "the authenticity of the alleged deed (Exh.
"D-1") is not<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>for this
office to decide, as only the courts have that prerogative."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Cariños appealed the decision of the LTA to the Office of the
President, which affirmed it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Motions
for reconsideration were filed by the Cariños but were denied, the last denial
being contained in a letter dated 22 March 1963, signed by Acting Assistant
Executive Secretary Juan S. Cancio.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Cariños refused to give up the possession of the lot despite
the rulings of the LTA and the Office of the President; thereafter, the Encabos
filed an action in the Court of First Instance of Manila to declare them as the
owners of the lot and for the Cariños to deliver the posses­sion of the lot
itself, and to pay rentals for their occu­pancy of the properties plus
attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After hearing and
trial, the lower court rendered decision in favor of the plaintiffs therein the
Encabos now private respondents, the dispositive part of which reads as
follows:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court renders judgment holding that the
plaintiffs Pablo Encabo and his wife Juanita de los Santos Encabo are entitled
to Lot No. 1, Block 4, Plan Psd-24819; that the deed of sale executed by the
Land Authority on April 18, 1967, in favor of said spouses is here­by upheld;
that the registration of the said deed of sale by the Register of Deeds of
Manila and the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 87826 in favor of
the plaintiffs Encabo are also upheld; that the order of this Court dated
September 8, 1967, cancelling and declaring the said deed of sale without any
effect is hereby set aside; that in the event that the Register of Deeds, has
already cancelled Certificate of Title No. 67825 as ordered by this Court in
its order of September 8, 1967, the said Register of Deeds, upon payment of the
required legal fees, is ordered to register again the Deed of Sale of Lot 1,
Block 4, Plan Psd-24819 executed by the Land Authority on April 18, 1967, in
favor of the plaintiffs Pablo Encabo and his wife Juanita de los Santos Encabo
and issue in their favor a new certificate of title for the lot in ques­tion;
that if Transfer Certificate of Title No. 87826 has not been cancelled by the
Register of Deeds, the same shall remain valid and in full force and effect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendants spouses Juanito Carino and Cirila Vicencio are
declared the owners of the house constructed on the lot in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They should remove the same within sixty (60)
days after this judgment shall become final, other­wise, the same shall be
ordered demolished.</blockquote>

from the Court of Appeals, could not find otherwise where the Amnesty Commis­sion,
the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals all found, in effect, that
the evidence did not show that the appellant had acted in the manner
contemplated by Amnesty Proclamation No. 8, after he had been given an oppor­tunity
to bring the homicide with which he was charged with­in its terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">As we see it, the only
legal question that stands as the basis of this petition centers on whether the
respondent Court of Appeals committed grave abuse of discretion in con­cluding
that the Deed of Sale of House and Transfer of Rights (Exhibit
"D-1"), on which the petitioners have based their application over
the questioned lot, is simulated and, therefore, an inexistent deed of sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds that there is substantial and convin­cing evidence
that Exhibit "D-1" was a simulated deed of sale and transfer of
rights, to warrant the affirmance of the decision of the respondent Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charac­teristic of
simulation is the fact that the apparent con­tract is not really desired or
intended to produce legal effects nor in any way alter the juridical situation
of the parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the circumstances surrounding their tran­saction, the parties knew that
the document Exhibit "D-1" was at once fictitious and simulated where
none of the parties intended to be bound thereby.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Cirila Vicencio during her direct exa­mination
was grossly inconsistent with her statements in the LTA administrative case
which she previously filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She tes­tified
in the lower court that she paid the Encabos five hun­dred pesos (P500.00) for
the lot, whereas, in the LTA admi­nistrative case she said that it was one
thousand pesos (1,000.00).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Aside from the purported Deed of Sale (Exhi­bit "D-1"), there is no
other document which evidences the payment of a sum of money by Cariño to the
Encabos for the disputed lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cirila
Vicencio also testified in the lower court that Exhibit "D-1" was
signed by Pablo and Juanita Encabo in Cariño's house at 4214 K Int. 8, Sociego,
Sta. Mesa, whereas, in the LTA <span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:
yellow">administative</span> case, she testified that it was signed in Las
Pinas, Rizal, the residence of the Encabos.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
These inconsistencies in the testimony of the Cariños are badges of
untruthfulness, showing that no actual and real sale of the lot in question
took place between the Encabos and the Cariños.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The testimony of a witness does not merit credibility or inspire
confidence where it is inconsistent and incompatible with his statements on
other occasions concerning the same fact.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Strongly indicative of the simulated character of Exhi­bit
"D-1" is the fact that the Carinos could not produce the receipts
evidencing their alleged payments to the Land Autho­rity for the disputed lot,
nor were they able to produce the Agreement to Sell (Exhibit
"G-1").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to Cirila
Vicencio, Juana Encabo took from her the Agreement to Sell and the receipts of
payments to the Land Authority in order to mortgage the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Cariños, who are the supposed ven­dees,
did not even remonstrate or offer a word of objection to this act of the
Encabos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cirila Vicencio, on cross-exami­nation,
testified thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Do

<p class="BODY">Previously, on direct examination, the testimony of Cirila
Vicencio was quite different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">According to Cirila
Vicencio, the receipts were borro­wed one (1) week before the case was filed on

Mrs. Encabo all the papers relative to the disputed lot so that the lat­ter can
mortgage the same, despite the fact that there was already an obvious misunderstanding
as to who was the real owner of the house and lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If these papers relative to the lot were
really in her possession, the reasons she gave for delivering them to the
Encabos are varied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A more credible
reason for the surrender of the papers was the one cited by </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Cariños in their petition to the LTA (Exhibit
100), wherein they alleged "that due to evident machinations em­ployed by
the respondent upon the petitioner and by taking undue advantage of the
latter's innocence and good faith in </span>his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">dealings with the former, the respondent herein has maneuvered the
petitioner into releasing to him the official receipts issued to the petitioner
for the corresponding payments made on the lot." But these allegations
were never pur­sued by the petitioners in the lower court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they gave different versions which
all the more weakened their stand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Granting that the papers relative to the lot were really in the
possession of the Cariños, the fact that they were delivered by Cirila Vicencio
to Juana Encabo, amounted to an act of complete ownership and control of the
property by the Encabos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As held in <u>Serrano

this Court finds it strange that respondent (Macaraya) would allow peti­tioner
(Serrano) to receive the fruits of the subject pro­perty several months after
he acquired absolute ownership of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is contrary to the principle of ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court also found as a fact that the names of the
Cariños were not mentioned as the proposed transferees in the two applications
with the LTA filed by Pablo Encabo for transfer of rights (at a time when the
alleged "Deed of Sale and Transfer of Rights", Exhibit
"D-1" was already executed in favor of the Cariños).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These appli­cations with the LTA were mere
speculations on the part of the Encabos if they should desire to sell the lot
later on (these applications were later withdrawn by the Encabos in a letter
dated May 9, 1960 [Exhibit 113]) and no inference can be made that they
intended to transfer the lot specifi­cally to the Cariños.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there were really an intent, then there
was no reason which would stop the Encabos from put­ting the name of the
Cariños as transferees, just like in the application to transfer to Quesada
wherein the latter's name was specifically mentioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these appear to clearly indicate a
positive lack of intention of the Encabos to transfer any right to the
petitioners (Cariños).</p>

<p class="BODY">Another factor which leads the Court not to disturb the
respondent Court's finding that Exhibit "D-1" is a simu­lated
document is the fact that such document was executed in November 1958 while the
Cariños petitioned the LTA to approve the transfer in their names of Encabos'
rights to the lot on the basis of such deed of sale, only on 19 April 1960.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The application was made just a day after 18
April 1960 when Josue Quesada resold to Encabo, for the same con­sideration of
P1,500.00 the house and rights to the lot pre­viously conveyed by the latter to
the former, pursuant to a previous agreement between Quesada and the Encabos,
provi­ding for such a resale should the transfer to Quesada of the Encabos'
rights to the lot be disapproved by the LTA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why did it take the petitioners that long to wait before they appealed
with the LTA if they really believed that Exhibit "D-1" was valid and
effective right from the time it was executed in November 1958?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such lack of eagerness on the part of the
Cariños to apply with the LTA for the transfer of the lot into their name
reveals their own conviction that the Deed of Sale is not real and effective
between them and the Encabos.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit to the Encabos' claim that the simula­ted deed of
sale in favor of the Cariños was executed in order to protect the money Quesada
invested in the purchase of the rights to the lot in question, which transfer
of said lot to his name was later on disapproved by the LTA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As can be gleaned from the testimony of Josue
Quesada, he did this by putting Cirila Vicencio as the vendee in the simulated
Deed of Sale, when in fact, Encabo and Quesada meant her only as a dummy for
the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To this effect Quesada
testified, despite the warning given to him by the court that his statement
might incriminate him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Such candor in the testimony of Quesada gives credibility to the Encabos'
claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the testimonies of the witnesses, it can be de­duced that
Cirila Vicencio was privy to all the transactions relating to the sale of the
disputed lot between Encabo and Quesada so that it is entirely possible for
Cirila Vicencio to have been used by Encabo and Quesada as their dummy in the
simulated deed of sale and for Cirila Vicencio herself to lend a hand in the
scheme so as to protect the interests of Quesada, and in the process, protect
herself as she was occupying the disputed lot at the instance of Quesada.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even at the start, it was Cirila Vicencio who
introduced Quesada to the Encabos in connection with a house and the right to
the lot, which according to Cirila Vicencio, was being sold by Juanita de los
Santos-Encabo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only that, Cirila
Vicencio signed as a witness on Exhibits "A" and "B" which
are the receipts of payment for the disputed lot by Quesada to Encabo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances surrounding the execution of the document
Exhibit "D-1" as recounted by the petitioners are bereft of
credence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are so weak that they
lead to the conclusion that indeed, there was no real and actual Deed of Sale
entered into.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners herein
have nothing else <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to support their
claim over the disputed lot except for the Deed of Sale, Exhibit
"D-1" which is even unnotarized, and the exact date of execution,
unknown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whereas, on the other hand, the
private respondents clearly have a preponderance of evidence negating the
validity of such deed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Contracts of sale are
void and produce no effect what­soever where the price, which appears therein

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Furthermore, even without
going into the merits and/or validity of Exhibit "D-1", it is clear
that there has been no legal transfer of rights in favor of the Cariños because
neither the LTA nor the Land Authority has approved or given </span>due course
to such transfer of rights.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
The LTA never waived its right to approve the transfer of rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It only ruled that the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>
will be maintained so long as the Court has not yet ruled on the authenticity
of document Exhibit "D-1".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
ownership of the lot by the Carinos is still contingent on the approval of the
LTA upon their compliance with all the requirements of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since no approval or due course has yet been
given by the LTA or LA to such transfer of rights, the document Exhibit
"D-1" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">is </span>not
