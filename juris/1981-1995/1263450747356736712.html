the Resolution of the </span><span style="">Court of Industrial
Relations </span><i style=""><span style="">en banc</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">affirming the Decision
in Case No. 4219-ULP finding petitioner Lirag Textile Mills, Inc. (LITEX, for
brevity) to have committed an unfair labor practice act in dis­missing its
employee, respondent Epifanio D. Blanco, for union activities and ordering his
reinstatement with back wages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The records disclose that
since 1957 there had existed in LITEX a union known as Litex Employees
Association (LEA, for short).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent Epifanio D. BLANCO, who was employed by LITEX on April 3, 1959,
joined that union a few months thereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 2, 1960, LEA
entered into its first collective bargaining agreement with LITEX for a period
of two (2) years, which was subsequently renewed for three (3) years, or up to
March 31, 1965.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agreement contained
a closed-shop provision as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">Union Security</i><span style="">. </span>? The COMPANY recognizes the UNION AS THE <span style="">SOLE </span>and exclusive collective
bargaining representative of all its employees and/or members.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">Union Shop</i><span style="">. </span>? It is mutually agreed between the COMPANY and the
UNION that newly-hired employees on probationary basis in accordance with
Section 2, Article III of this AGREEMENT, are required as a condition or
prerequisite of continued employment on a regular basis to join and be member
of the UNION in good standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
con­tinuing condition of employment with the COMPANY that employees coming
under this AGREEMENT should be and must remain as good standing members of the
UNION.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The UNION therefore, may from
time to time recommend to the COMPANY, the separation from the service of any
of its members for reasons that he or she is no longer a member of the UNION in
good standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, those losing
their member­ship in the UNION could not be retained in the employ of the
COMPANY."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime in January,
1964, BLANCO and several employees organized the Confederation of Industrial
and Allied Labor Organization (CIALO).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On April 1, 1964, CIALO filed a petition for certification election at
LITEX before the Court of Industrial Relations (Case No. 1332-MC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was dismissed, however, and said
Court certified LEA as the sole bargaining representative of the rank and file
employees of LITEX.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

April 10, 1964, you were a) found distributing leaflets and reading materials
inside the Service Bus, b) subsequently apprehended at the gate with several
other leaf­lets and an envelope with leaflets for distribution to company
employees and c) refused to be searched upon entrance at the gate, in violation
of existing company rules and regulations.</blockquote>

inefficiency on September 27, 1961 and June 1, 1963, respectively, and
suspended twice on June 29, 1961 for act of mischief re­sulting in injury to a
co-employee and on July 29, 1963 for refusal to be searched and utterance of
bad words against the guards and other offenses contained in our letter of July
10, 1963, we have decided after giving you a definite last warning on July 11,
1963, to terminate your services effect­ive on Friday, April 24, 1964.</blockquote>

three days before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><span style="">April 27, 1964, LITEX advised LEA of its </span><span style="">reluctance to effect the termination from the

<p class="BODY">In its Answer, LITEX denied the charge and raised defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was subsequently heard <span style="">on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">LEA endeavored to intervene but its Motion was denied by
respondent Court for lack of legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 17, 1966, the Court of Industrial Relations rendered
judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the case of com­plainant Epifanio Blanco, the
court finds respondents to have violated the Industrial Peace Act and hereby
orders them to cease and desist from committing the censurable acts herein
found, to reinstate him to his former or equivalent position with­out loss of
seniority and other pri­vileges, and to pay him backwages at the rate of fifty
(50) per cent from the time of his dismissal up to his reinstatement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to all the other complainants, for lack of merit and
insufficiency of evidence, the com­plaint is hereby DISMISSED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court rationalized its holding in respect of BLANCO,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>'Exhibit 'A - Blanco', an unobjected piece of material evidence,
shows beyond doubt that the consequent act of respondent company interfered
with the exercise of the employee's right to self-organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Blanco was not even investigated by the
company to find out whether or not he did refuse to be searched, as this is the
only regulation alleged to have been violated (Exhibit 'A-Blanco').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the concur­rence of
other grounds, stale as they were, reeks with pretext and cannot justify the
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is explicitly clear that
the pre­vailing reason for his separation from the service was his union
activities."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">LITEX moved for
reconsideration, but this was denied by respondent Court </span><i style="">en banc</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">on November 16,
1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LITEX appealed to this instance
assigning the following errors to respondent CIR:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>"The Respondent Court erred in holding that the Litex
Employees Association (LEA) did not demand the dismissal of the respondent
Epifanio Blanco pursuant to the Union Shop provision of the Collective Bargain­ing
Contract (Exhibit 2) just because his name did not appear in the letter (Exhibit
4) in spite of sufficient testimonial and documentary evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>The Respondent Court erred in holding that the dismissal of
respondent Epifanio Blanco for violation of company rules was an unfair labor
practice just because the violation was at the same time a union activity, and
in justifying this holding to consider a just warning for inefficiency and post
violations for mis­conduct for which he was warned the first time, and for
subsequent mis­conducts for which he was twice suspended, as a result of which
he was given a definite last warning, as 'stale' grounds although the last
violation for which he was dismissed occurred within nine (9) months from the
time the definite last warning was issued to him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent Court ruled
that the five other com­plainants (Lalucis, Canlas, Roldan, Florentino and
Fontaina) were legally separated from the service pursuant to the closed-shop
agreement and the con­stitution and by-laws of LEA, which have binding effect on
the parties, but ruled as unfair labor practice the dismissal of BLANCO, his
name not having been included in the list of member-employees who were expelled
from the union and recommended to the company for dismissal from the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no justifiable
reason to single out BLANCO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in
an identical position as the five other complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If his name was not included in the list of
18 employees recommended for dismissal, it was because he had been dismissed
three days before by the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if
he had not been dismissed by the company, his dismissal would have been
demanded by LEA considering that he was one of those investi­gated by LEA's
grievance committee which had approved the recommendation to dismiss them on
the charge of being members of another union.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, in paragraph 4 of the Complaint (<i>supra</i>) BLANCO made
common cause with the other complainants for having been dismissed "for no
other reason than their willingness to join the (CIALO) union and/or
affiliation therein and union activities so as to discourage membership thereto
x x x." BLANCO admitted his affiliation with CIALO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is evidence, too, that he, together
with his co-employees organized a rival union, CIALO, in contravention of the
collective bargaining agreement and the constitution and by-laws of LEA, of
which they were then members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These acts
of BLANCO and his co-workers of organizing a rival union and distributing
leaflets and propaganda papers, clearly constituted a ground for expulsion
under Section 5 of LEA's constitution and by-laws, quoted hereinabove.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court has held that
closed-shop is a valid form of union security, and such provision in a collect­ive
bargaining agreement is not a restriction of the right of freedom of
association guaranteed by the Constitution.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Respondent Court upheld the vali­dity of the
closed-shop agreement of LEA and LITEX, when it ruled as legal the dismissal of
complainants except respondent, pursuant thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court should have also upheld as
legal the separation from the service of BLANCO on the same ground in the face
of evidence that he committed the same violation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case of Manalang vs.
Artex Development </span>Company, Inc., <i>supra</i>, is authority for the view
that:</p>

<blockquote>"Even if we assume, in gratia argumentis, that the petitioners
were unaware of the stipulations set forth in the collective bar­gaining
agreement, since their membership in the BBLU prior to their expulsion
therefrom is undenied, there can be no question that as long as the agreement
with closed-shop provision was in force, they are bound by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither their ignorance of, nor their
dissatis­faction with, its terms and condi­tions would justify breach thereof
or the formation by them of a union of their own."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his Answer to the
present Petition, BLANCO claimed that the closed-shop provision applies only to
newly hired employees and not to old employees like himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He abandoned this argument in his Brief,
however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that he was
already a </span>member of LEA when the collective bargaining agreement
containing the closed-shop provision was executed, and therefore, he was bound
by the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a general rule, the
findings of facts of the Industrial Court are final and conclusive when
supported by substantial evidence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> However, where, as in this case, respondent
Court ignored the evidence ad­duced by the parties, it is guilty of grave abuse
of discretion as to warrant a review by this Court of its findings of fact.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We come now to the second
assigned error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respond­ent Court ruled
that the prevailing reason for BLANCO's separation from the service was his
union activities, and it considered as "stale" the other grounds for </span>which
he was dismissed, namely, previous misconduct and violations of company rules
and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, this is reversible
error.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">BLANCO himself admitted
that he was suspended for mischief on June 21, 1961; warned for misconduct and
inefficiency on September 27, 1961 and June 1, 1963; suspended on June 25, 1963</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">; nearly dis­missed on July 13, 1963 pursuant
to a letter of dismissal, dated July 10, 1963, but through LEA's intercession
was given a last warning instead on July 11, 1963, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We are giving a reconsideration to the case of Mr. Epifanio
Blanco, on the representation of the Litex Employees Association although the
facts of the case warrant immediate termination.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is noteworthy that one
of the grounds of dismissal cited by LITEX in its letter of April 23, 1964 was
BLANCO's refusal to be searched upon entrance at the company gate in violation

misconduct or misdemeanors form part of an employee's record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BLANCO's present infraction coupled with his

inevitably led to his dismissal on April 24, 1964.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An employee may be
