sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>,
accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
is now before us on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In substance, the evidence for the prosecution follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="11">17 November 1984</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the evening,
complainant Virginia L. Baring, 18, was resting at her quarters at the Atlas
Socio Economic Project, <st1:place><st1:placename>Abaca</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Township</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Poog</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">Toledo</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where she was then
working.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, accused <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, a distant
relative, showed up, and requested her to accompany him outside the township to
buy some toothache tablets for his wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suspiciously, she asked him if there were no one else to go with them,
to which the accused retorted - "Do you not trust me, we are relatives?”
Disarmed by his reply, <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
reluctantly went with him (TSN, pp. 2-10, 31 July 1985).</p>

<p class="BODY">They passed along a footpath, <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span>
walking slightly ahead of <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
(TSN, p. 6, 18 February 1986).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place
was not well lighted, there being no lamp post.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only illumination was provided by a bulb on a fence lining the
pathway (TSN, p. 6, 27 January 1987).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>About sixty meters away from the quarters, <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span>
suddenly turned around, faced <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>,
and hugged her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A "<span class="SpellE">holihod</span>" (a round sharp pointed instrument, used for
punching holes in shoes, about six inches in length and about one-half inch in
diameter) was in his hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He covered
her mouth with his palm, continually kissed her on the cheeks and bit her upper
lip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was successful in removing her
"<span class="SpellE">maong</span>" pants and her panty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was then forced to lie down on the ground
(TSN; pp. 12-18, 31 July 1985; p. 8, 18 February 1986; p. 7, 4 April 1986).</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state> tried to
get up but <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> struck her with his fists on her
head, left arm and on the breast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
cross-examination, she narrated that the blows somewhat caused her to lose
consciousness for when she regained her senses, <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span>
was already on top of her deflowering her (TSN, pp. 9-11, 18 February
1986).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pain made her shout (TSN, pp.
18-19, 31 July 1985).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even then, she
struggled to free herself to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In her estimation, <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> succeeded in
satisfying his lust in about twenty minutes (ibid, pp. 20-21).</p>

<p class="BODY">His evil desire consummated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> threatened <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
not to mention a word of the incident to anyone, or else, he would kill her
(ibid, pp. 21-22).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way back,
they met Eduardo Silva, a co-worker, who was asked by <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span>
if his (<span class="SpellE">Enemecio's</span>) wife was looking for him to <span class="GramE">which</span> Eduardo answered in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eduardo noticed that <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
kept silent (TSN, pp. 3-4, 21 January 1987).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> and Virginia parted ways, she
returned directly to her quarters where she burst into tears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little later, co-employees <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarmia</span> and Edwin <span class="SpellE">Tingal</span> arrived and to whom she revealed her harrowing
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, in turn, advised her
to report the matter to her parents (TSN, <span style="">p</span>p.
22-26, 31 July 1985).</p>

<p class="BODY">Early the next day, <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="11">18
 November 1984</st1:date>, <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>,
accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarmia</span>,
went home to her parents at <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, to tell them of the outrage on her person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother, <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span>
Baring, recalled that they arrived at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30</st1:time>
in the morning (TSN, pp. 4-6, 17 July 1987).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the parents were told, they decided to go back to <st1:place><st1:placename>Toledo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> to report the crime to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter <span style="">told </span>them to go
to the police, who in turn, advised <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
to undergo a medical examination (TSN; p. 28-29, 31 <span style="">July </span>1985; pp. 4-5, 17 July 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, on 19 November, <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
went to the City Health Officer of <st1:place><st1:placename>Toledo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> for examination (TSN, p. 3, 24
June 1986).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor's Physical
Injuries Report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D, D1 - D2) detailed the
following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"1. <span class="SpellE">Hematoma</span>
located at the let upper outer quadrant left breast.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. Linear abrasion located at the
right elbow.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. Slight swelling with tenderness
located at the left <span class="SpellE">cociput</span> - head.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. Lacerated wound - upper lip.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"5. On internal examination:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lacerated hymen with slight bleeding located
at the following areas:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">5, </span>7, and 9 o' clock.”<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> admitted
having had carnal knowledge of <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
on the date alleged but maintained that force was not employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His story was that on <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="11">17 November 1984</st1:date>, at about 6 o<span style="">' </span>clock in the evening, he invited <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
to go out of the township.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While passing
along a narrow road, <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
placed her hand over his shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
gestured back by placing his hand over her shoulders (TSN, pp. 7-8, 14 October
1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She confessed that she loved
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He responded and replied that he
loved her, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, they descended to
the cornfield some <span class="GramE">fourteen<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(</span>14) meters from the road and embraced and kissed each other
(TSN, pp. 2-3, 18 March 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No signs
of resistance were shown by <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, <span style="">she </span>welcomed his advances (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
61).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He removed all his clothes and then
proceeded to remove hers gradually (TSN, p. 3, 18 March 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They passionately made love thereafter (ibid,
pp. 4-5).</p>

<p class="BODY">After evaluating the conflicting versions, the Trial Court tilted
the judicial scales in favor of the prosecution, pronounced <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span>
guilty sentenced him to <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>,
and ordered him to indemnify <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
in the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, <span class="GramE">this appeal</span>, with the following
Assignments of Error:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred in holding
that force was employed by the appellant in attaining his purpose of having
sexual intercourse with the complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred in holding
that the sexual intercourse was committed at the time when the complaining
witness was unconscious.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred in
convicting the appellant despite absence of sufficient evidence for a valid
conviction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a nutshell, the appeal is anchored on <span style="">the </span>defense that the sexual congress was with the consent and
cooperation of <st1:state><st1:place>Vir<span style="">g</span>inia</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span>
denies that he had threatened <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
with <span class="GramE">an</span> "<span class="SpellE">holihod</span>,"
claiming that the latter is not a deadly weapon but a small pointed tool and it
is inconceivable that <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
would not have been able to defend her honor and chastity at the threat of a
puny "<span class="SpellE">holihod</span>." He further contends that if
he had forced sex on <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>,
the latter would have suffered numerous bruises considering that barbed wire
lined both sides of the narrow pathway where they were. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In addition, he expresses wonder that Virginia
made no loud outcries despite the fact that the place was only sixty (60)
meters away from her sleeping quarters and forty (40) meters away from the
nearest residential house.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> further maintains that if it
were true that he had raped <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>,
she would have said so immediately to Eduardo Silva whom they met on their way
back to her quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even questions <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>’s
having gone to her parents in <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, to disclose the occurrence to them
instead of reporting the matter to the local authorities <span style="">or </span>to the security force of the
township.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Brief, <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> theorized that
the rape charge was brought only for the purpose of showing <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villarmia</span>, Virginia's boyfriend, who came to know of
the incident, that her "sexual tryst" with <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span>
was a forced one, which scheme succeeded as <span class="SpellE">Tirso</span>
eventually married Virginia.</p>

<p class="BODY">In short, as in most rape cases, the credibility of the victim is
put to an acid test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find <span class="SpellE">Enemecio's</span> submissions, however, unpersuasive, the
circumstance of force and intimidation having been proven by testimonial and
documentary evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">That force was employed is apparent in the Physical Injuries
Report (Exhibits D, D1 - D2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
injuries and bruises sustained by <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
are clearly indicated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
“linear abrasion at the right elbow" confirms the struggle that took place
between barbed wire fences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "<span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> at the left breast," and the slight swelling
with tenderness located at the left <span class="SpellE">cociput</span>-head"
substantiates <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>’s
allegation that <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> hit her with his fists on
different parts of her body immediately prior <span style="">to </span>the dastardly act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
"lacerated wound - upper lip" establishes <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>'s
testimony that <span class="SpellE">Enemecio</span> had bitten it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The injuries listed in the medical
certificate are herein referred to not to prove those injuries <u>per</u> <u>se</u>
but to substantiate the use of force.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other physical indications of force are <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>'s
panty with detached garter (Exhibits A, A-1) and her denim pants with a torn
portion just below the zipper (Exhibit B).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These mutely but eloquently indicate the violence with which they were
hastily removed, as against <span class="SpellE">Enemecio's</span> claim of
having gradually removed the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to <span class="SpellE">Enemecio's</span> protestations, <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
could not have made loud outcries as he had covered her mouth with his
hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Added to this, was the continued
threat of the "<span class="SpellE">holihod</span>," a weapon which,
while not ordinarily classified as deadly, could, like any pointed tool, be
capable of piercing human flesh if it could go through leathered shoes and
soles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The combination was enough to instill
fear into <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state> and cow her to
submit to <span class="SpellE">Enemecio's</span> lewd desires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the combined circumstances had
rendered her unconscious.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The fact that </span><st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:state><span class="GramE"> did not
disclose to Eduardo Silva, whom the met upon their return, the assault on her
chastity cannot be taken against her credibility.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>She must have still been in a state of shock
for the abuse perpetrated on her person besides the fact that she could not
openly flaunt the disgrace that befell her to a mere passerby whose ability to
help her could have been nil.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do we find anything wrong in Virginia's resolve to return
home to <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, fifty
(50) kilometers distant, to confide to her parents the ignominy she had
suffered at the hands of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, it was a most natural reaction for a daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her parents were the most logical persons to
turn to for understanding, advice, solace, and vindication of the wrong
inflicted on her, not to mention the fact that family honor was also inevitably
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, indeed, together, they
lost no time in going back to <st1:place><st1:placename>Toledo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to report to the local authorities, as a starter in their quest for justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense had subjected <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
to stringent cross-examination in an attempt to entangle her in contradictions,
and to prove that she was fully conscious all throughout the criminal encounter
and had consented thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She remained
steadfast and fully credible, however.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There may have been slight inconsistencies in her testimony, but this is
understandable considering that she was rendered unconscious, and had undergone
a traumatic experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere
circumstance that she was testifying in the presence of strangers on an
intimate matter not usually even mentioned in public might have caused her not
a little embarrassment and confusion that rendered her narration less than
perfect (People v. <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span>, G.R. No. 47628, 15 May
89, 173 SCRA 373).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the contention that the rape charge was feigned to cover
up for Virginia's infidelity to her boyfriend, by making it appear that she <span style="">was </span>forcibly deprived of her virginity,
is simply preposterous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has
consistently held that the testimony of a rape victim as to who abused her is
credible, where she has no motive to testify against the accused except to
vindicate the wrongful act against her honor (People v. Lopez, G.R. No. 47299,
19 February 1986, 141 SCRA 385; People v. Nunez, G. R. No. 54445, 12 May 1989,
173 SCRA 274), and where, as in this case, her testimony is buttressed by
indubitable evidence of guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is hereby AFFIRMED, with
the modification that the indemnity awarded to Virginia L. Baring is hereby
