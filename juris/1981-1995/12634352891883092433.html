				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The cases herein were consolidated upon the representations of
petitioners that they involve the same issues or questions of law or at the
very least, revolve around the same set of facts.  A perusal of the records, however, reveals the contrary.  Only two petitions are properly
consolidated.  Thus, it behooves Us to
discuss the cases separately.</p>

<p class="BODY">In blatant violation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Section
</span>2, Rule 45 of the Rules of Court which in part, provides:</p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 2.  Contents of the
petition – The petition <u>shall contain a concise statement of the matters
involved</u>, the assignment of errors made in the court below, and the reasons
relied on for the allowance of the petition, x x x.  (Emphasis <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Ours.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Only questions of law may be raised in the petition and must be
distinctly set forth.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x x x.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">this petition devotes nine (9) pages
under the subtitle “Summary statement of the matters involved” to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>discussion of matters off tangent
from the real issues in the case.  Definitely, the question of whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in
ruling that the Regional Trial Court did not commit grave abuse of discretion
in issuing an order suspending <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">hearing </span>pending
the resolution of their motion to dismiss, does not involve the Philippine Bill
of 1902, Executive Order No. 141, much less P.D. 1214.  The counsel for petitioners even discussed
pending cases in this Court (G.R. No. 63786 - 87 and 69203) which have
completely nothing to do with the instant petition except for the fact that the
parties therein are being represented by the same counsel as in this petition.  In several pleadings subsequent to their
petition, petitioners insisted that the proceedings in the court below must be
restrained until this Court resolves the pending cases abovecited.  For this reason this case was consolidated
thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">A summary of the real matters involved in this petition is found
in the respondent Court’s decision, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to enjoin
the Regional Trial Court, Branch XL, in Camarines Norte from issuing a writ of
preliminary injunction in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Civil </span>Case
No. 5148 and to disqualify the respondent judge from acting in that case.  The case was brought by the respondents
Marsman and Co., Inc. and United Paracale Mining, Inc., to enjoin the
petitioners, Joseph V. Lopez and Miguel Andrade, from entering and conducting mining
operations within the “McDonald” and “San Antonio” Tunnels in Paracale,
Camarines Norte, in which the private respondents have mining claims
(“Tulisan,” “Santa Marta,” “California,” and “Rocky Mountain Fraction”).  On December 11, 1984 the RTC issued a
restraining order against the petitioners.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On December 12 the petitioners filed their answer alleging that, in
accordance with PD 1214, the private respondents had forfeited their right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to the mining claims.  They likewise argued that in view of PD 605,
the RTC had no jurisdiction to entertain the case.  </span>On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the same day
the petitioners moved for the disqualification of the respondent judge of the
RTC, caliming (sic) that in issuing the restraining order of December 11, 1984,
he showed his “bias, prejudice and personal hatred of and hostility to the
[petitioners’] counsel [Atty. Pedro A. Venida].”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On December 24, 1984 the petitioners filed a motion for a
preliminary hearing on their defense that the RTC lacked jurisdiction under PD
605 to issue a temporary restraining order or injunction in cases involving or
growing out of the action of administrative officials on the applications for
permits for the disposition, exploitation, utilization, or exploration or
development of the natural resources.  Accordingly the RTC, in its order of September 5, 1985, suspended the
hearing of the case until the resolution of the petitioners’ motion to
dismiss.  It is at this point that the
present petition was filed.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court denied this petition on grounds that:  (1) the questions being raised are not
proper in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 but rather defenses
which should be raised in the action itself; (2) the question of jurisdiction
which has yet to be resolved by the trial court pending resolution of the
motion to dismiss is prematurely raised; and (3) there was no basis for
determining whether <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">or not the </span>judge
must be disqualified.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The review of this decision is what is on appeal before Us.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We refuse to be persuaded by the petitioners that the RTC must be
enjoined from exercising its jurisdiction in settling the case presented before
it for the reason that the constitutionality of the law involved in the said
case is being questioned before this Court.  This case should have been disposed of independently of the other
petitions herein.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court of Appeals committed no reversible
error.  Neither did it commit grave
abuse of discretion as what petitioners want this Court to believe.  The petitioners fail to point out any
assigned error which the respondent Court had supposedly committed but simply
narrate the action taken by it.  Much
less have they stated the reasons relied upon for the allowance of the instant
petition.  For being insufficient in
substance and in form, the instant petition lacks merit and must be dismissed.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This petition seeks to reverse the order of then Judge, now
Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals, Hon. Alfredo L. Benipayo, dismissing
the complaint filed by petitioner herein on the ground of lack of jurisdiction,

the then CFI of Manila, Branch XVI, was one for the rescission of its mining
contract with herein private respondent on grounds of violations of the terms
and conditions thereof, with prayer for the issuance of a preliminary
injunction and/or temporary restraining order.  The trial court, however, upon motion of the defendant therein,
dismissed the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner wants Us to
construe Section 7 of P.D. 1281 as applicable only to mineral lands forming
part of the public domain and not to mining claims located and registered under
Philippine Bill of 1902 and Act No. 624 as is its case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Section 7 of P.D. 1281
reads </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sec. 7.  In addition to its
regulatory and adjudicative functions over companies partnerships or persons engaged
in mining exploration, development and exploitation, the Bureau of Mines shall
have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a mining property
subject of different agreements entered into by the claim holder thereof with
several mining operators;</p>

<p class="2Q">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>complaints from
claimowners that the mining property subject of an operating agreement has not
been placed into actual operations within the period stipulated therein; and</p>

<p class="2Q">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>cancellation
and/or reinforcement of mining contracts due to the refusal of the
claimowner/operator to abide by the terms and conditions thereof.</p>

<blockquote>All actions and decisions of the Director of Mines on the above
cases are subject to review <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">motu proprio</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>or upon appeal by any person
aggrieved thereby, by the Secretary of Natural Resources whose decision shall
be final and executory after the lapse of thirty (30) days from receipt by the
aggrieved party of said decision, unless appealed to the President in accordance
with the applicable provisions of Presidential Decree No. 309 and Letter of
Instructions Nos. 119 and 135.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The view of the petitioner that by virtue of the registration of
the mining claims under the Philippine Bill of 1902 and Act No. 624, the mining
claims became private property and thereby brought outside the control and
supervision of the Director of Mines is without legal basis.  The abovecited law does not distinguish
between private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">property </span>and
lands of the public domain.  The
provision of law involved is clear and is not susceptible to
interpretation.  A condition <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sine
qua </span>non</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>before the
court may construe or interpret a statute is that there be doubt or ambiguity

Section 7 of P.D. 1281 quoted above defining the original and exclusive
jurisdiction of the Director of Mines is clear.  Time and again, it has been repeatedly declared by this Court
that where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>law speaks in
clear and categorical language, there is no room for interpretation.  There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the law is clear and unambiguous, it must be taken to mean exactly what
it says and the court has no choice but to see to it that its mandate is
obeyed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">This Court in <u>Benguet Corporation vs. Leviste</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

made these pronouncements:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“We grant the petition.  Presidential Decree No. 1281 which took effect on January 16, 1978 vests
the Bureau of Mines with jurisdictional supervision and control over all
holders of mining claims or applicants for and/or grantees of mining licenses,
permits, leases and/or operators thereof, including mining service contracts
and service contractors insofar as their mining activities are concerned.  To effectively discharge its task as the
Government’s arm in the administration and disposition of mineral resources,
Section 7 of P.D. 1281 confers upon the Bureau quasi-judicial powers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Analyzing the objective of P.D. 1281, particularly said Section 7
thereof, the Court in Twin Peaks Mining Association, the case relied upon by
petitioner, noted that the trend is to make the adjudication of mining cases a
purely administrative matter.  This
observation was reiterated in the more recent case of Atlas Consolidated Mining
&amp; Development Corporation vs. Court of Appeals.”<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner further argues that to hold that P.D. 1281
retroactively applies to its mining claims which according to it is private
property would constitute impairment of vested rights since by shifting the
forum of the petitioner’s case from the courts to the Bureau of Mines, as urged
by private respondent, the substantive rights to full protection of its
property rights shall be greatly impaired and prejudiced.  The judicial relief available for the
redress of private property rights violated, now being enjoyed by petitioner
shall be lost altogether.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument does not merit Our approval.  There can be no vested right in a judicial
relief for this is a mere statutory privilege and not a property right.  The distinction between statutory privileges
and vested rights must be borne in mind for persons have no vested rights in
statutory privileges.  The state may
change or take away rights which were created by the law of the state, although
it may not take away property which was vested by virtue of such rights.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the right to judicial relief is not a right which may constitute
vested right because to be vested, a right must have become a title, legal or
equitable, to the present or future enjoyment of property, or to the present <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">or </span>future enforcement of a demand or
legal exemption from a demand made by another.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Definitely, the judicial relief herein referred to by the petitioner does not
fall under any of these.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar falls within the original and exclusive
jurisdiction of the Bureau of Mines, hence, the trial court did not err in
dismissing the petitioner’s complaint on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding Our ruling in favor of the constitutionality of
P.D. 1214, petitioners contend that having filed mining lease applications on
the mining claims they have previously located and registered under then
existing laws, pursuant to the requirements of this Presidential Decree, and
despite the <u>waiver of their rights to the issuance of mining patents
therefor</u> (emphasis theirs), they cannot be placed in equal footing with
those who forfeit all rights by virtue of non-filing of an application within
the prescribed period such that they (petitioners) have no causes of action
against private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded by this contention.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Although We may agree that those who filed their mining lease
applications have better rights than those who forfeited all their right by not
filing at all, this, however, does not amount to any vested right which could
be the basis for their cause of action against herein private respondents.  What is precisely waived is their right to
the issuance of a mining patent upon application.  This in effect grants the government the power, in the exercise
of its sound discretion, to award the patent to the applicant most qualified to
explore, develop and exploit the mineral resources of the country in line with
the objectives of P.D. 463, and not necessarily to the original locator of the
mining claim.  To sustain their
contention that they can question the award of mining patents to applicants
other than them would put to naught the objectives of P.D. 1214 as enunciated
in its <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">WHEREAS</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>clauses.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court that with the waiver of their right
to the issuance of a mining patent upon their application for a mining lease,
their status is reduced to mere applicant, their only advantage over the others
is the fact that they have already conducted explorations at the site and this
exploration may be ongoing.  But still,
this credential, so to speak, is not intended to tie the hands of the
government so as to prevent it from awarding the mining patent to some other
applicants, which in its belief may be more qualified than them.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
