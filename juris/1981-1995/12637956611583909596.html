<p class="BODY">In this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the decision 
promulgated on <span>January </span>26, 1982 by the Ninth Division of respondent 
Court of Appeals affirming in full the decision rendered on August 31, 1981 by 
Branch II of respondent <span>Court </span>of Agrarian Relations, Tenth Regional 
District, <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City, petitioners allege violation of 
their constitutional rights to <span>due </span>process and the equal protection 
of the laws.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The pertinent facts are as follows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On March 8, 1979 private respondent filed with the Court of 
Agrarian Relations an action for reinstatement with damages against petitioners 
which was docketed therein as CAR Case No. 5524 CS'79.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The agrarian court found and the parties agree that the main 
issue raised in said case was factual in character — whether or not private 
respondent was the <em>bona-fide</em> agricultural tenant-farmer (now 
agricultural lessee) on the two parcels of agricultural land subject-matter of 
the complaint.<span>&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, this is the crucial issue 
because the resolution of all the other issues depends upon its 
resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In its aforementioned decision rendered on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="8"><span>August 31, 1981</span></st1:date><span>, 
the agrarian court also found "that the greater preponderance of evidence 
sustains plaintiff's (private respondent's) claim that he is the 
<em>bona-fide</em> tenant-farmer, now agricultural lessee, of the two (2) 
parcels of land in question." The decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations 
consisted of thirteen pages, single space.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Pursuant to Section 18 of Presidential Decree No. 946, an 
appeal was taken by the petitioners from the decision of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations to respondent Court of Appeals and was docketed therein as CA-G.R. No. 
13522-CAR. Section 18 of P.D. No. 946 reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 18.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Appeals.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— An appeal may be taken to the Court 
of Appeals by giving an oral or written notice of appeal with the trial court

</span>A copy of the written notice of appeal shall be served within the same 
period upon the adverse party.<span>&nbsp; </span>In case the notice of appeal is 
orally made, the clerk of court shall reduce the same to writing, which shall be 
signed by the appellant and a copy thereof served within the same period by the 
clerk of court to the adverse party.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"In case a motion for reconsideration is filed within that period of 
fifteen (15) days, the notice of appeal shall be filed within ten (10) days from 
notice of the resolution denying the motion for reconsideration.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Only one motion for reconsideration shall be allowed a 
party.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Court of Appeals shall affirm the decision or order or the 
portions thereof appealed from if the findings of fact <span>in </span>the said 
decision or order are supported by substantial evidence as basis thereof, and 
the conclusions stated therein are not clearly against the law and 
jurisprudence.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals shall not be precluded from 
taking into consideration any issue, question or incident, even if not raised, 
if resolution thereof is necessary for a complete and just disposition of the 
case.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Court of Agrarian Relations shall forward to the Court of 
Appeals the complete records of the case within a non-extendible period of 
fifteen (15) days from receipt of a notice of appeal, if no motions for 
reconsideration are filed.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the event that motions for 
reconsideration are filed, the records shall be forwarded to the appellate court 
within a like period from receipt by the party concerned of the denial of the 
last motion for reconsideration.</blockquote>

settler, or amortizing owner-cultivator is directed.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"<em>Upon receipt of the records of the case from the Court of 
Agrarian Relations, the Court of Appeals may, if it deems necessary, require the 
parties to file simultaneous memoranda within a non-extendible period of fifteen

(30) days from receipt of said records or memoranda</em><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

over other cases.</blockquote>

the Supreme Court by petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> only on questions 
of law, within a non-extendible period of thirty (30) days from receipt by the 
appellant of a copy of the decision or order." (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>No notice of the receipt of the records from the Court of 
Agrarian Relations was issued by respondent Court of 
Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Neither was any notice issued by respondent Court of Appeals

<blockquote>"This is the judgment rendered by His Honor, Judge Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Llaguno</span>, presiding judge, Branch II, Court of Agrarian 
Relations, Tenth Regional District, with station at <span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City, which is now brought to <span class="GramE">Us</span> for review in this appeal.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"After a perusal of the records of the case, We find the issues 
definitely and clearly set out by the pleadings and that the evidences adduced 
by the parties are adequately complete as to give Us no room for vacillation on 
the correct and just resolution of the issues.<span>&nbsp; </span>This persuades 
<span class="GramE">Us</span> to dispense with the usual practice of requiring the 
parties to submit to Us their memoranda, in lieu of briefs.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
simplicity of the factual and legal issues involved makes it more desirable to 
dispose of this case at the earliest possible time.<span>&nbsp; </span>And as appeals 
of this nature and of such kind of cases merely require the appellate finding of 
whether or not the decision is supported by substantial evidence and that it is 
not contrary to law and jurisprudence, then all that We have to do is to make a 
review of the evidence adduced by the parties and to pass upon the trial court's 
conclusions of law and of fact in the light of the evidence 
adduced.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"We have, therefore, carefully reviewed the evidence and made a

expediency, therefore, <span class="GramE">We</span> hereby adopt, by way of 
reference, the findings of facts and conclusions of the court <em>a quo</em> 
spread in its decision, as integral part of this Our decision.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The exhaustive and intelligent dissertation of the issues in the 
appealed decision renders it unnecessary for <span class="GramE">Us</span> to make 
further disquisition.<span>&nbsp; </span>The well-written decision of the lower court 
does not need any improvement.</blockquote>

applicable law and jurisprudence, is hereby AFFIRMED in full.</blockquote>

appellants.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Judgment AFFIRMED."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the present petition.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">In addition to alleging violation of their constitutional rights 
to due process and to equal protection of the laws, petitioners contend that the 
findings of fact in the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations, as affirmed 
<em>in toto</em> by respondent Court of Appeals, are not supported by 
substantial evidence and the conclusions stated therein are clearly against the 
law.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners claim that had respondent Court of Appeals not 
dispensed with the usual practice of requiring the parties to submit 
simultaneous memoranda in <span>lieu </span>of appeal briefs they could have 
pointed out to respondent Court of Appeals which findings of fact in the 
decision of the lower court are not supported by substantial evidence and which 
conclusions stated therein are clearly against the law.</p>
<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the case of <em>Molino vs. Court of Appeals</em>, a division of 
this Court held that "one of the important reasons for the promulgation of P.D. 
No. 946 is expressed in the <span class="SpellE">preambular</span> words:<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span>'x x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> to streamline their (Courts 
of Agrarian Relations) procedures to achieve a just, expeditious and inexpensive 
disposition of agrarian cases,'" and that "the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> purpose of the statute is desirable and the 
means provided to accomplish it are reasonable." (July 30, 1982, 115 SCRA 801, 
802)</p>
<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that under Section 19 of The Judiciary 
Reorganization Act of 1980, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, the Courts of Agrarian Relations were integrated 
into the Regional Trial Courts and their former jurisdiction was vested in the 
latter courts.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, it was also provided in Section 24 of said 
law that whenever a Regional Trial Court takes cognizance of juvenile and 
domestic relations cases and/or agrarian cases, the special rules of procedure 
applicable to such cases under the laws then in force shall continue to be 
applied, unless subsequently amended by law or by rules of court promulgated by 
the Supreme Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although not expressly provided in said law, 
the procedure on appeal provided by P.D. No. 946 is still applicable until 
amended as above stated.</p>
<p class="BODY">Although Section 18 of P.D. No. 946, in the interest of the 
expeditious administration of justice, empowers <span>the Court of Appeals to 
dispense with memoranda in deciding agrarian cases, a division of this Court has 
held as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Nothwithstanding</span> the foregoing, we hold 
that, as a matter of orderly procedure and to dispel the impression that a 
litigant in an agrarian case has been denied due process or was not accorded 
<span>a </span>hearing in the Court of Appeals, it is advisable that if the 
Appellate Court finds that memoranda are not necessary, it should at least issue 
a notice to the parties that the case is submitted for decision without any 
memoranda." (<span class="SpellE"><em>Ty</em></span><em> vs. Elale</em>, July 5, 
1982, 115 SCRA 29, 33)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>We reiterate this ruling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, no notice was given to the parties, and 
particularly to petitioners, that the case was submitted for decision without 
any memoranda.<span>&nbsp; </span>The former Solicitor General, in <span>his 
</span>brief for the public respondents (no brief was filed by private 
respondent), argued that due process was not violated because petitioners could 
have submitted their memorandum any time between perfecting the appeal and the 
forwarding of the complete records to the Court of Appeals, and they could also 
have done so after receipt by the Court of Appeals of the records of the case, 
before a decision had been made.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, there is no provision in 
P.D. No. 946 that authorizes the appellant to file a memorandum any time after 
the perfection of the appeal and before the forwarding of the complete record to 
the Court of Appeals.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the records show that no notice of 
the receipt of the records from the lower court was issued by respondent Court 
of Appeals, and petitioners did not know that said appellate court had dispensed 
with the usual practice of requiring the parties to submit their memoranda until 
they were notified of its decision.</p>
<p class="BODY">Procedural due process contemplates notice and opportunity to be 
heard before judgment is rendered.<span>&nbsp; </span>(See the cases cited in 
<em>Luzon Surety Co., Inc. vs. Panaguiton</em>, 84 SCRA 148, 153.) If the 
appellate court had notified the parties that the case would be submitted for 
decision without any memoranda, petitioners would have had the opportunity 
before the case was decided to submit a brief or memorandum pointing out the 
errors of fact or law committed by the agrarian court.</p>
<p class="BODY">As it <span>is, </span>petitioners assign in their brief filed 
with this Court four errors allegedly committed by the <span>agrarian court in 
its findings of fact and two errors of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The errors of fact assigned by petitioners are as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintain that private respondent Ibarra, who claimed 
tenancy of the two parcels of land with areas of .50 and .60 hectares owned by 
them, was <span class="GramE">himself</span> a landowner.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In their first assignment of error, they cite numerous 
inconsistencies in the testimony of the private respondent which, if taken into 
consideration, would be sufficient to warrant a reversal of the decision of the 
Court of Agrarian Relations as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">The Solicitor General's brief attempts to refute this 
assignment of error by quoting from the transcript of stenographic notes and to 
rebut the other alleged errors of fact by quoting from the decision of the Court 
of Agrarian Relations.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>This Court should not be burdened 
with the task of deciding these questions of fact, a task which properly 
pertains to respondent Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Section 18 of P.D. No. 946 provides that "if the decision or order 
be an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> <em>in toto</em> of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> conclusion of the judgment appealed from, then 
the Court of Appeals may, instead of rendering an extended decision, indicate 
clearly the trial court's findings of fact and pronouncements of law which have 
been adopted as basis for the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>."</p>
<p class="BODY">This requirement seeks to insure compliance with the mandate of 
Section 9, Article X of the 1973 Constitution <span>that "Every decision of a 
court of record shall clearly and distinctly state the facts and the law on 
which it is based," which mandate is also found in Section 12, Article VIII of 
the 1935 Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">A provision similar to the above-quoted provision in Section 18 of 
P.D. No. 946 is found in Section 40 of<span> Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 (effective on 
August 14, 1981, although the reorganization of the courts took effect on 
January 17, 1983) which provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 40.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Form of decision in 
appealed cases.<span> </span>— Every decision or final resolution of a court in 
appealed cases shall clearly and distinctly state the <span>findings </span>of 
fact and the conclusions of law on which it is based, which may be contained in 
the decision or final resolution itself, or adopted by reference from those set 
forth in the decision, order, or resolution appealed from."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">This provision modified the penultimate paragraph of Section 33 of 
the Judiciary Act of 1948 as amended which read:<span>&nbsp; </span>"Every decision 
of the Court of Appeals shall contain complete findings of fact on all issues 
properly raised before it."</p>
<p class="BODY">The above-quoted provisions in Section 18 of P.D. No. 946 and 
Section 40 of B.P. No. 129 are of particular importance with respect to the 
Court of Appeals because its findings of fact are generally final and 
conclusive.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(A summary of the exceptions to this 
rule is made in <span class="SpellE"><em>Sacay</em></span><em> vs. 
Sandiganbayan</em>, July 10, 1986, 142 SCRA 593.)</span></p>
<p class="BODY">As previously stated, the decision of the Court of Agrarian 
Relations consisted of thirteen pages, single<span> space.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
above-quoted decision of the respondent Court of Appeals consists of four pages, 
three of which contains verbatim the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> 
portion of the decision appealed from.<span>&nbsp; </span>The remaining page is 
devoted to an explanation of why "for judicial convenience and expediency, 
therefore, We hereby adopt, by way of reference, the findings of facts 
</span>and conclusions of the court <em>a quo</em> spread in its decision, as 
integral part of this Our decision." The said decision may be considered as 
substantial compliance with the above-quoted provisions in Section 18 of P.D. 
No. 946 and Section 40 of B.P. No. 129.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the authority 
given the appellate court to adopt by reference the findings of fact and 
conclusions of law from those set forth in the appealed decisions should be 
exercised with caution and prudence, because the tendency would be to follow the 
line of least resistance by just adopting the findings and conclusions of the 
lower court without thoroughly studying the appealed case.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, considering that, as above shown, petitioners 
were not given the opportunity to submit to the appellate court the errors 
allegedly committed by the agrarian court, we deem it necessary in the interest 
of justice to remand the <span>case </span>to the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="BODY">Under our present judicial system, a party is generally allowed 
one appeal as a matter of right and a second appeal as a matter of 
discretion.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence it is that an appeal may be taken as a matter of 
right from the decision of a metropolitan or municipal trial court to the 
regional trial court; but the appeal from the decision of the regional trial 
court in such a case is a matter of discretion, whether the appeal be to the 
Court of Appeals on both questions of fact and law through a petition for review 
(Section 22 of B.P. No. 129 and Section 22(b) of the Interim Rules), or to this 
Court on questions of law only through a petition for review on 
<i>certiorari</i> (Rule 45 and Section 25 of the <span>Interim Rules).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>From the decision of a regional trial court in an action originally filed 
with it, an appeal may be taken as </span><span>a </span><span>matter of right 
to the Court of Appeals on both questions of fact and law; but the appeal on 
questions of law only from the decision of the Court of Appeals to this Court in 
such a case through a petition of review on <i>certiorari</i> is a matter of 
discretion.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE"><em>Lacsamana</em></span><em> vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, et 
al.</em>, G.R. No.</span> L-73146-53, </span><st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="8"><span>August 26, 1986</span></st1:date><span>.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the case at bar, petitioners had the right to appeal from 
the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations </span>to the Court of 
Appeals.<span>&nbsp; </span>And since Section 18 of P.D. No. 946 provides, following 
the general rule, that "the decisions or orders of the Court of Appeals may be 
appealed to the Supreme Court by petition for review <span>on 
</span><i>certiorari</i> only on questions of law," petitioners should be given 
the opportunity to correct errors in the findings of fact made by the trial 
court.<span>&nbsp; </span>And this is particularly necessary in agrarian cases where 
no motion for rehearing or reconsideration is allowed in the Court of Appeals 
(Section 18, <em>Ibid.</em>).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It cannot be too strongly emphasized that just as important 
as the intrinsic validity of a decision is the perception by the 
parties-litigants that they have been accorded a fair opportunity to be heard by 
a fair and responsible magistrate before judgment is rendered.<span>&nbsp; </span>It 
is this perception, coupled with a clear conscience, which enables the members 
of the judiciary to discharge the awesome responsibility of sitting in judgment 
on their fellowmen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision promulgated by respondent Court of 
Appeals affirming in full the decision of the Court of Agrarian Relations is set 
aside and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals to enable the parties to 
file simultaneous memoranda within a non-extendible period of fifteen days from 
notice, after which respondent Court shall render a decision upon the points 
raised and discussed in said memoranda that were not touched upon in the 
decision of the agrarian court which was adopted by the appellate court as basis 
for its original judgment of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>No costs.</p>
