<p class="BODY">The prosecution's eyewitness, Jimmy Din, positively identified
appellant as the triggerman in the killing of Nelson Tandoc.  Din recounted that at around 2:00 A.M on
March 7, 1992, he and his friend, Nelson Tandoc, were conversing with each
other in front of Lucky Hotel located at M. H. del Pilar Street, Dagupan City,
which was owned by the witnessâ€™ father and of which he was the administrator.  He noticed a man pass by on the opposite
side of the street.  The man made a
dirty sign with his finger and Din informed Tandoc thereof.  The man repeated his offensive act and
called them by waving his hands.  Infuriated, they followed the man until the latter stopped in front of
the Dunkin' Donuts store at the corner of Arellano and Fernandez streets.  They demanded an explanation from the man
but they were not given any.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At that instant, two men arrived and one of them inquired what
was going on.  Tandoc informed him that
they were just demanding an explanation from the man.  Din was surprised when Tandoc unexpectedly slapped one of the two
men.  A brawl ensued, with Tandoc
clashing with the two men while Din exchanged blows with the man who made the dirty
finger sign.  After the fisticuffs,
their three opponents ran away in a westward direction.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Tandoc and Din then decided to walk back to the hotel.  When they were about to enter the place,
they noticed that the men with whom they just had a fight were running towards
them.  Sensing danger, they ran inside
the annex building of the hotel and immediately secured the lock of the sliding
outer door.  They entered a room and waited
until they felt that the situation had normalized.  After ten to fifteen minutes, thinking that the men were no
longer in the vicinity, they left the room.  Having decided to go home, Tandoc opened the sliding door.  All of a sudden, Din saw appellant, who at
that time was wearing a security guard's <span style="">uniform,
shoot Tandoc with a revolver.  There was
a fluorescent bulb installed at the front of the hotel which enabled Din to
identify the assailant.  Tandoc was shot
in the middle of the chest and he fell down.  Then, Din saw four to five men scamper away from the scene.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Aware of his injury, Tandoc told Din, "Tol, I was
shot." The latter tried to chase appellant and his companions but he
failed to catch up with them.  Din and
his wife then brought Tandoc to the Villaflor Hospital.  The victim was taken to the emergency room
but he expired an hour later.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At about 3:45 A.M. of March 7, 1992, SPO3 Reynaldo de Vera of the
Dagupan City Police Station received a report about a shooting incident at the
annex building of the Lucky Hotel.  He
proceeded to the crime scene along with SPO4 Orlando Garcia, SPO3 Mauricio
Flores and SPO3 Noli de Castro.  Upon
their arrival about five minutes later, they were informed by the wife of Jimmy
Din that the victim had been brought to the Villaflor Hospital.  They proceeded to the hospital where Din
informed them that he could recognize the man who killed Tandoc and that the
killer was, at that time, wearing the polo shirt of a security guard's uniform.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">They decided to proceed to an eatery called "Linda's
Ihaw-Ihaw." Seeing the security guard of a nearby bus company, they
inquired from him if he knew of any unusual incident that happened in the
vicinity.  The guard said that he saw
the guard of "Linda's Ihaw-Ihaw," together with some companions,
chasing two persons running towards M. H. del Pilar Street.  He further added that the man was wearing a
polo shirt of a security guard's uniform.  Asked where that particular guard might be, he pointed to a man eating
inside <span style="">the eatery nearby.  The man eating was not in a security guard's
uniform.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">They approached the man and inquired whether he was the security
guard of "Linda's Ihaw-Ihaw," which the latter answered in the
affirmative.  After <span style="">a </span>series of questions, they learned
that he was Samuel Marra, that his tour of duty was from 7:00 P.M. of a
preceding day to 6:00 A.M. the following day, that he was still on duty at
around 2:30 in the morning of March 7, 1992, and that the firearm issued to him
was in his house.  Upon their request to
see the firearm, they proceeded to Marra's residence at Interior Nueva Street.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When they arrived, Marra took a .38 caliber revolver from inside
an <i><span style="">aparador</span></i><span style=""> </span>and handed it to De Vera.  De Vera also found five live bullets and one
spent shell.  Smelling gunpowder from
the barrel of the gun, De Vera asked Marra when he last fired the gun but the
latter denied ever having done so.  Abruptly, De Vera asked him point-blank why he shot Tandoc.  Marra at first denied the accusation but
when informed that someone saw him do it, he said that he did so in
self-defense, firing at the victim only once.  Tandoc allegedly had <span style="">a <i>samurai</i>
</span>sword with him at the time of the incident.  However, persistent efforts on the part of the policemen to
thereafter locate <span style="">said </span>bladed
weapon proved futile.  Marra also
admitted that prior to the incident, he <span style="">chased
the victim and Din.  The officers then
took Marra to the police station where he was detained.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, De Vera went to Villaflor Hospital from where he
fetched Din and brought him to the police station.  There, Din definitely identified Marra as the assailant.  During the investigation, De Vera also found
out that Marra had no firearm license.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Tomas G. Cornel, Assistant City Health Officer of Dagupan
City, testified that he conducted an autopsy on a certain Nelson Tandoc.  He found a gunshot wound on the victim with
the point of entry at the left side of the anterior chest wall and the point of
exit at the lower left portion of the right shoulder.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecutor Gregorio Gaerlan, stepfather of the victim, testified
on the funeral, burial and other expenses incurred by the family.  He declared that they paid Funeraria Quiogue
P25,000.00 for its services; Villaflor Hospital, P2,875.00 for the confinement
of Tandoc; St. John Memorial Cathedral, P350.00; Eternal Garden, P3,000.00 for
the interment fee and P150.00 for the rent of the tent during the burial; and
that they spent P2,300.00 for the video tape expenses and P11,800.00 for food
and drinks during the wake.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Understandably, appellant gave a different version of the
incident.  Marra declared in court that
he used to work as a security guard at "Linda's Ihaw-Ihaw" from seven
o'clock in the evening to six o'clock in the morning of the following day.  On March 6, 1992, he reported for duty at
seven o'clock that evening <span style="">as was </span>his
usual practice.  At around four o'clock
dawn of the following day, he went home to change his clothes.  He proceeded to the Five Star Bus Terminal
which was adjacent to "Linda's Ihaw-Ihaw." He saw Neneng, the cashier
of said eatery, and together they ordered <i><span style="">arroz caldo</span></i><span style="">.  </span>Later, at about 5:00 A.M., he was
approached by four policemen who inquired if he was a security guard.  He answered in the affirmative.  He was also asked about his sidearm.  When he answered that it was at his
residence, they all went to his house to look for it.  After he handed over the firearm to the policemen, he was brought
to the city hall where he was detained.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under cross-examination, he insisted that when he handed the gun
to the policeman, there were five live bullets, and not four live bullets and
one empty shell as claimed by the prosecution.  Prior to the incident, he had never met Jimmy Din nor does he know of
any cause why Din would harbor any ill feelings against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful scrutiny of the records and an objective
evaluation of the evidence, the Court is not disposed to reverse the judgment
of the lower court, the decision of the latter being amply supported by the
established facts and fully sustained by the applicable law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In assailing the decision of the court below, the defense argues
that "Jimmy Din x x x was not able to identify the assailant in a definite
and believable manner." It goes <span style="">on
</span>to state further that "Jimmy Din was inside the hotel when Nelson
Tandoc was shot and his vision was o(b)structed by the door.  Jimmy Din was also not familiar <span style="">with </span>the accused.  Under the circumstances by which he
allegedly witnessed the shooting, how could be identify clearly an assailant at
the distance of 45 meters?"<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's counsel is only partly correct, having conveniently
failed to mention other vital parts of Din's testimony.  An impartial review of said testimony
readily reveals that Din was indeed in a position to know the identity of the
assailant.  Firstly, Din knew for a fact
that the persons he and Tandoc fought with near the Dunkinâ€™ Donuts store were
the same men who chased them while they were on their way back to the hotel
because he was able to take a good look at them.  During the chase, he naturally turned around to look at the men
who were running after them and who were at that time in front of the Balingit
Trading store which was well-lighted.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> It
logically follows that they were the same persons who were waiting for them
when they later came out of the hotel, and he was familiar with their
identities because of their previous encounter.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, we do not agree with appellant that the door blocked
the view of Din.  Said door, partly made
of plywood, had a spring hinge which makes it possible for the door to close by
itself.  However, at that time the
spring hinge had been weakened by long and constant use such that it would take
some time for it to close the door, thereby allowing Din sufficient opportunity
to have an unobstructed view of the scene outside.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, Din was quite near the victim and appellant, which
proximity enabled him to clearly see what really happened.  He thus readily perceived the actual
shooting at the time when Tandoc pushed the door open.  At that precise moment, Din was at the left
side of Tandoc and about four to five meters <span style="">away </span>from the assailant.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the place was brightly illuminated by <span style="">a </span>20-watt fluorescent bulb installed <span style="">on </span>the outside wall <span style="">in </span>front of the hotel.  Marra was <span style="">only </span>about three meters away therefrom.  Such physical conditions would undeniably
afford a clear view from inside the hotel of the immediate area outside and in
front of the same where the incident took place.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented another vital witness in the person of
Sgt. Reynaldo de Vera, whose testimony we shall repeat here for easy
reference.  In capsulized form, De Vera
narrated the sequence of events that happened after he and <span style="">his companions went to the crime scene to
conduct an investigation.  Having
received information that a man in a security guard's uniform was involved in
the incident, they sought information from a security guard of a nearby bus
terminal.  Said security guard pointed
them to Marra, who at that time was eating in a </span><i>carinderia</i> <span style="">nearby.  Informed by Marra that his gun </span>was at <span style="">his residence, they all went to Marra's residence to get the same.  After receiving said firearm, De Vera asked
appellant why he killed Tandoc but Marra initially denied any participation in
the killing.  Nevertheless, when confronted
with the fact that somebody saw him do it, Marra admitted the act although he
alleged it was done in self-defense.  This testimony of De Vera as to the confession of Marra is of
significant weight, but the admissibility thereof shall also be passed upon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 12(1), Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that
"(a)ny person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall
have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have
competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice.  <span style="">x x
x." </span>The critical inquiry then is whether or not Marra was under
custodial investigation when he admitted the killing but invoked
self-defense.  We believe that he was
not so situated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Custodial investigation involves any questioning initiated by law
enforcement officers <i>after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise
deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way</i>.  It is only after the investigation ceases to
be a general inquiry into an unsolved crime and begins to focus on a particular
suspect, <i>the suspect is taken into custody, and the police carries out a
process of interrogations that </i><i><span style="">lends
</span>itself to eliciting incriminating statements</i> that the rule begins to
<span style="">operate.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, appellant was not under custodial
investigation when he made the admission.  There was no coercion whatsoever to compel him to make such a
statement.  Indeed, he could have
refused to answer questions from the very start when the policemen requested
that they all go to his residence.  The
police inquiry had not yet reached a level wherein they considered him as a
particular suspect.  They were just
probing into a number of possibilities, having been merely informed that the
suspect was wearing what could be a security guard's uniform.  As we held in <i>People vs. Dy</i>:<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
"What was told by the accused to Pat. Padilla was a spontaneous statement
not elicited through questioning, but given in an ordinary manner.  No written confession was sought to be
presented in evidence as a <span style="">result of
formal custodial </span><span style="">investigation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">The
Trial Court, therefore, cannot be held to have erred in holding that compliance
with the constitutional procedure on custodial investigation is not applicable
in the instant case, </span><span style="">x x
x."</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the testimony of Sgt. de Vera assumes a dominant
dimension because it totally destroys the defense of denial <i><span style="">cum</span></i><span style=""> </span>alibi subsequently raised by appellant.  In his answers to Sgt. De Vera, appellant
expressly admitted that he shot Tandoc, albeit with an exculpatory
explanation.  This admission of Marra is
in complete contrast to the statements he later made in open court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the law provides that the declaration of an accused
acknowledging his guilt of the offense charged, or of any offense necessarily
included therein may be given in evidence against him and, in certain circumstances,
this admission may be considered as part of the <i>res gestae</i>.  In a similar situation involved in the
aforecited case of<i> </i><i><span style="">People </span>vs.
</i><i><span style="">Dy</span></i><span style="">, </span>this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x the oral confession made by the accused to Pat. Padilla
that â€˜he had shot a touristâ€™ and that the gun he had used in shooting the
victim was in his bar which he wanted surrendered to the Chief of Police
(t.s.n., October 17, 1984, pp. 6-9) is competent evidence against him.  The declaration of an accused acknowledging
his guilt of the offense charged may be given in evidence against him (Sec. 29
[now Sec. 33], Rule 130).  <i><span style="">It may in a sense be als</span></i><span style="">o<i> </i></span><i>regarded as part of the
res gestae</i>.  The rule is that, any
person, otherwise competent as a witness, who heard the confession, is
competent to testify as to the substance of what he heard if he heard and
understood all of it.  An oral
confession need not be repeated verbatim, but in such a case it must be given
in substance.  (23 C.J.S. 196, cited in
People vs. Tawat, G.R. No. 62871, May 25, 1985, 129 SCRA 431)." (Italics
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In any event, even without his admission, the case against
appellant has been duly established by the other evidence of the prosecution,
as earlier discussed.  However,
persistently arguing for an acquittal, the defense points out that when the
police officers saw Marra, he was not in a blue uniform whereas Din testified
that the person who shot Tandoc was wearing the polo shirt of a security
guard's uniform.  This is a puerile argument
since appellant himself removed any lingering doubts on this point.  He said that on ending his tour of duty at
4:00 A.M. of March 7, 1992, he decided to go home to change clothes, after
which he went to "Linda's Ihaw-Ihaw" to eat.  This explains why, at the time the police
officers saw him, he was already in civilian clothes.  The shooting had taken place earlier at around 2:00 A.M.  At that time, Marra was still in his
security guard's uniform, being then on duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, while we agree that the crime committed by appellant was
murder qualified by treachery, we reject the finding that the same was
aggravated by nighttime.  No evidence
was presented by the prosecution to show that nocturnity <span style="">was </span>specially sought by appellant or
taken advantage of by him to facilitate the commission of the crime or to
ensure his immunity from capture.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> At
any rate, whether or not such aggravating circumstance should be appreciated,
the penalty to be imposed on appellant would not be affected considering the proscription
against the imposition of the death penalty at the time when the offense in the
instant case was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the court <i><span style="">a quo </span></i>finding accused-appellant
