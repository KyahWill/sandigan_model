				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For love of a woman, one man has been stabbed to death and his
rival, together with his companion, has been convicted of the killing.  The judgment is now before us.  The accused-appellants pray for reversal,
claiming that the circumstantial evidence against them was not sufficient to
convict.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information for murder was originally filed in the Court of
First Instance of La Union against Ricardo Pajarit, Rodolfo Pagador, Jaime
Obra, and several John Does.  The charge
against Obra was dropped when he died during the trial of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The series of events leading to the tragedy began in the
afternoon of May 11, 1975, when Rogelio Carig and Rodolfo Pagador found
themselves paying court to Cecilia Palanas at her parents’ store in Oya-oy,
Bacnotan, La Union.  One thing led to
another until Pagador, who had some companions with him, stepped out and
challenged Carig to a fight.  Carig
ignored the challenge.  Cecilia's
mother, Etang Almojuela, pacified the two and Pagador's group left.  But they were heard to say that they would
return that night.</p>

<p class="BODY">They did return, walking around Carig's house until
midnight.  The group consisted of
Pagador, Ricardo Pajarit, Jaime Obra, and several others.  Obra was carrying a gun.  Their movements so alarmed Eulalia Carig,
Rogelio's mother, that she reported the matter to the police the following
morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of May 12, 1987, the group went back to Eulalia's
house.  She had guests that night and
had come down to the yard, at about eight o'clock, to catch some chickens for
their supper.  Rogelio was with her.  She was carrying a kerosene lamp.  By the light of the lamp, she recognized
Pajarit, Pagador and Obra as they approached.  Obra had a flashlight that he pointed at her face.  She asked the men where they had come from
and was told they had been to Etang Almojuela's place.  Sensing trouble, she told her son Rogelio to
go upstairs.  She did so herself, preceding
Rogelio.</p>

<p class="BODY">As Rogelio ascended the steps, he suddenly cried out, “Mother,
bring out the light! I have been stabbed by Carding!” Eulalia and her other
son, Juan Gañola, ran to the victim's aid and found he had been stabbed in the
left buttock.  They saw the group
running away.  Rogelio was rushed to the
Lorma Hospital, but it was too late.  He
was dead on arrival as a result of the massive hemorrhage caused by the stab
wound.  The autopsy later revealed that
his assailant was in a lower position, and behind his victim, when he struck.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above narration was made by the several witnesses for the
prosecution, notably Eulalia Carig,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> Juan

the victim's half-brother, Crispin Ancheta,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> one
of the supper guests on that fatal night, and Dr. Ernesto Gallardo, the
medico-legal officer who performed the autopsy.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both the accused-appellants testified, each pleading separate
alibis.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pagador testified that on May 11 and 12, 1975, he was busy
gathering and flue-curing tobacco leaves in his farm.  He worked from 6 o'clock in the morning until midnight, stopping
only for lunch and supper.  At seven
o'clock in the evening of May 12, he attended to his mother, who was suffering
abdominal pains.  He denied that he was
with Ricardo Pajarit and Obra during those days.  He was corroborated by Bernardo Pajarit<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> and
Feliciano Teofilo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Pajarit testified that he was nowhere in Barrio Oya-oy on
May 11, and 12, 1975, but in his grandmother's farm in Bangar 400 kilometers
away.  He left Bangar only in the
morning of May 13, 1975, to bring food for his grandmother's workers in Barrio
Oya-oy, arriving there at about 9:30 a.m.  There was no corroboration of this testimony.  On the contrary, Etang Almojuela, who testified for the defense,
declared that he was one of the persons who visited at her house on May 12,
1975.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the evidence of the parties, Judge Vicente A.
Pacquing found both Pajarit and Pagador guilty as charged and sentenced them to
<u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> and civil indemnity in the sum of P30,000.00
plus costs.  The trial court found that
the victim had been treacherously attacked and that the accused had acted in
concert, making the act of one the act of the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal, the accused-appellants maintain that they
had not been positively identified as the killers; conspiracy between them had
not been proved; treachery did not attend the commission of the crime; and that
their separate defenses of alibi should not have been rejected by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conviction of the accused-appellants was based on
circumstantial evidence.  This kind of
evidence is sufficient if (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the
facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination
of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable
doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that there was no eyewitness to the stabbing of the
deceased.  Even so, the circumstances
all point to the accused-appellants as the culprits.  The most telling of these circumstances is Rogelio's cry that he
was “stabbed by Carding” moments after his mother left Ricardo Pajarit and his
group at the yard of her house.  As she
immediately responded to her stricken son's call, she saw these same men
running away from the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The utterance of the deceased was correctly appreciated as part
of <u>res</u><u style="text-underline:words"> g</u><u>estae</u> under Rule 130,
Sec. 36, of the Rules of Court providing that “statements made by a person
while a startling occurrence is taking place or immediately prior or subsequent
thereto with respect to the circumstances thereof, may be given in evidence as
part of the <u>res</u><u style="text-underline:words"> </u><u>gestae</u>.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The said utterance was heard not only by the mother and the
brother of the victim but also by Crispin Ancheta, who was at their house at
that particular moment.  The accused-appellants
argue that it should not be given credence because the testimonies of the three
prosecution witnesses on what was actually said are inconsistent.  We do not agree.  The record reveals that the inconsistencies are trivial and do
not detract from the substance of the declaration of the deceased that he “was
stabbed by Carding.” If at all, these minor discrepancies reinforce rather than
weaken the credibility of the three witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants also assail the claim of the prosecution that
they were positively identified by the victim's mother, stressing that the
crime was committed on a dark night.  It
was clearly established by the prosecution, however, that Eulalia was carrying
a lighted kerosene lamp that night to catch the chickens intended for their
visitors’ supper.  Eulalia was then
standing at the foot of the stairs and the accused-appellants were merely 7 1/2
meters away from her.  The light coming
from the kerosene lamp, not to mention Obra's flashlight, was enough to enable
Eulalia to recognize the accused-appellants, who were her barrio mates and
known neighbors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pajarit's alibi should be dismissed outright in view of the
testimony of Etang Almojuela.  Although
she was supposed to testify for the defense, she contradicted Pajarit and said
that he was in fact in Oya-oy, Bacnotan, on the night of the stabbing.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Pagador, he has not established the physical impossibility
of his presence at the scene of the crime, given the fact, which he himself
revealed on the stand, that his residence was in the same barrio, merely 500
meters away from the victim's house.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the accused-appellants’ alibis cannot stand against
their positive identification by Eulalia Carig and Juan Gañola as two of the
men who were at Eulalia's yard moments before and after the victim cried out to
his mother that he has been stabbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the trial court that there was conspiracy between
the appellants becomes persuasive when viewed in light of the incident the day
before and during the actual stabbing.  Pagador was heard to have challenged the victim to a fight when they
both happened to visit Cecilia at the same time.  The night after the incident, the accused-appellants and his
companions walked to the house of the victim, roaming the vicinity until
midnight.  They returned the following
night, and it was then that the victim was stabbed to death.</p>

<p class="BODY">A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement
concerning the commission of a crime and decide to commit it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It is enough for it to exist that, at the time the offense was committed, the
participants had the same purpose and were united in its execution, as may be
inferred from attendant circumstances.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence.  Circumstantial evidence, provided it is competent and convincing,
is sufficient to establish conspiracy.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We come now to the finding of treachery.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is treachery “when the offender commits any of the crimes
against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof
which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk to
himself arising from the defense which the offended party might take.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The mere fact that the victim was stabbed in the buttock, indicating
that the assailant was behind the victim, did not necessarily make the act
treacherous.  There is no showing that
the accused-appellants employed any means to directly and specially insure the
execution of their act without any risk to themselves.  The victim himself cannot be said to have
been surprised by the stabbing, particularly after his mother, fearing danger,
had told him to go up the house.  He
must have felt apprehensive too and so cannot be said to have been totally
unprepared for the aggression.  We have
held that when the manner of attack has not been proven, the appellant should
be given the benefit of the doubt and the killing should be considered as
homicide only.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the
prescribed penalty under Articles 249 and 64 of the Revised Penal Code is <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> in its medium period.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, we hereby impose on the
accused-appellants an indeterminate sentence within the range of <u>prision</u>
<u>mayor</u> as minimum and <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> medium as
maximum.  The award of indemnity will be
increased to P50,000.00, conformably to existing policy.  In all other respects, the decision of the
trial court will be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED as above
modified.  The accused-appellants are
hereby declared guilty of homicide and sentenced to suffer the indeterminate
penalty of six years and one day of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u> as minimum to
fourteen years, eight months and one day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
medium as maximum.  They are further
required to pay the heirs of the victim, jointly and severally, the sum of
Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00), plus the costs of the suit.</p>
