extended to June 30, 1966, under Res. No. 799, FY-1965-66, (copy attached as

projects, who were granted original appointment from January 1, 1965, up to the

<blockquote>"8.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That said PHHC

<blockquote>"10. That pursuant to Res. No. 133, FY 1966-67, dated August

incorporated in the budget of the Multi-Storey Tenement Projects a lump sum
appropriation of P51,500.00 for wages of casuals under Res. No. 556, dated
November 8, 1966."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must be added, in relation to paragraph 8 of the stipulation
of facts, that the approval by the Office of the Economic Coordination of said
PHHC Resolutions No. 686 No. 799, was made subject to the explicit condition
"that the abolished positions should not be re-created thereafter."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the Trial Court's view, the only question presented was
"whether or not Resolution No. 686 of the PHHC dated <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1966</st1:date> for the Fiscal Year 1965-Â­66,
covers the case of the petitioners herein." That issue it answered in the
negative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While Resolution No. 686 was
passed avowedly "to abolish the positions and terminate the services of
all PHHC employees including those in the independent PHHC projects as of April
30, 1966, for the reason that * * the PHHC has a very low cash position and * *
could no longer afford to pay the salaries of its officials and
employees," the Court declared that "the Multi-Storey Tenement
Project is not one of the independent projects of the PHHC." According to
the Court, it was "a project of the National Government and the employees
of the same were paid out of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the funds
derived from the rentals of the said property;" hence, the petitioners
"can be considered as not actually employees of the PHHC but employees of
the Multi-Storey Tenement Housing Project erected under the national funds,
(falling) however, for administration purposes ** under the PHHC."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said Resolution No. 686 was branded by the Trial Court as a mere
pretext, politically motivated, to replace the old employees with people of the
choice of the new directors and officers of the PHHC; Rubio and his thirty-one
(31) co-employees, petitioners herein, "were dismissed from the service
without cause, (t)he respondents ** pretending lack of funds ** merely as a
means to employ ** new employees which took the place of the herein
petitioners." That pretense, the Trial Court held, was exposed by certain
subsequent developments, i.e., the hiring of replacements for all but one of
the thirty-two petitioners barely a month after the latter's separation from
the service; the continued retention in employment of these casuals up to the
time of the trial although they were ostensibly hired only for three (3)
months; and the inclusion in the following year's budget of "an
appropriation of P51,500.00 for the salaries of the casuals of the Multi-Storey
Tenement Housing Project" (which latter circumstance, the Trial Court
further points out, also belies the asserted reason of the PHHC for the
discharge of the employees, i.e., that it was low on funds).</p>

<p class="BODY">Chiefly on these premises, the Trial Court rendered judgment for
the petitioners as above mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PHHC and its co-respondents insist, on the other hand, that
Resolution No. 686 dated <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="3">March 10,
 1966</st1:date> applies to all PHHC employees, including those in the
so-called Multi-Storey tenement projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They maintain that since, by specific provision of law, the PHHC had
been designated administrator of said projects, "it necessarily follows
that the PHHC, by implication, is vested with the authority and power to
determine which offices and positions are necessary to be created and to be
abolished." In support of their theory, they invoke this Court's ruling in
<span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ulep</i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>,
et al.,</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>G.R. No. L-17807, <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1962</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

to the effect that the "power to create an office includes the power to
abolish it, unless there are constitutional or statutory rules expressly or
impliedly providing otherwise."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents in their brief also draw attention to the
particular powers granted by law to the PHHC and to its General Manager, and
underscore<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>the fact that the latter may -</p>

<blockquote><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">"
</span>** appoint and fix the number and salaries, with the approval of the
Board of directors, of such subordinate personnel as may be necessary for the
proper discharge of the duties and functions of the Corporation, and, with the
approval of the Board, ** remove, suspend, or otherwise discipline, for cause,
any subordinate employee of the Corporation (italics supplied)."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Their arguments are unpersuasive and unavailing.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court agrees with the Trial Court that the facts on record
do establish that the resolution in question was a mere pretext to replace the
petitioners-employees, that there was in fact no abolition of positions either
contemplated or actually effected, and the employees engaged subsequent to the
termination of the petitioners' services were not in truth "casual"
but more or less permanent, provision for their salaries having in fact been
made in the budget for the following year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What happened simply is that the petitioners-employees were dismissed
without cause, contrary to the very provision of law just adverted to (in the
next preceding paragraph hereof), that the PHHC General Manager has power
"to remove ** <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">for cause</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>any subordinate employee of the Corporation."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court therefore also declares that the Trial Court was
correct in directing reinstatement of the petitioners-employees to their former
positions, and the payment to them of back salaries and other benefits they
would otherwise have earned.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is however no longer an easy matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it is doubtful if
reinstatement as a remedy would be feasible in view of the fact that more than
twenty-three (23) years have already elapsed since the petitioners-employees'
positions were abolished.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Many of them will have found employment elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Some
may have passed away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Many others will
have reached retirement age or will no longer be employable on account of age
or inadequacy of qualifications, by this time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the second place, as the PHHC and the other respondents allege,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> it would be unfair to "permit a
dismissed laborer to earn back wages for all time, or for a very long period of
time," without allowing the employer to prove the salaries the laborer had
earned during the period of his separation, or what efforts he had exerted to
find gainful employment; and they suggest that the award of back salaries
should be limited to three months.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> Providentially, fairly adequate alternative
relief may be granted to the petitioners under a statute enacted, and
precedents promulgated, subsequent to the respondents' resolution abolishing
their respective positions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

otherwise known as the Local Government Code, was passed by the legislature and
became effective on <st1:date year="1983" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 76 thereof (under Title Four:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Personnel Administration) provides as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>SEC 76. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Abolition of Position</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">. -- </span>When the position of an official
or employee under the civil service is abolished by law or ordinance the
official or employee so affected shall be reinstated in another vacant position
without diminution of salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Should
such position not be available, the official or employee affected shall be
granted a separation pay equivalent to one month salary for every year of service
over and above the monetary privileges granted to officials and employees under
existing law.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the provision on its face is apparently intended for
the benefit only of officers and employees in the local political
subdivisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court however sees no
reason why it should not be applied as well to other personnel of the
government, including those in the People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span>
and Housing Corporation, which was then considered part of the Civil
Service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A contrary conclusion would
make the provision questionable under the equal protection clause of the
Constitution as there appears to be no substantial distinction between civil
servants in the local government and those in other branches of government to
justify their disparate treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
the petitioners are "employees under the civil service,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
the matter of their reinstatement to their former positions at this time should
logically and justly be governed by the above cited statute although enacted
many years after the abolition of their positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since, too, it may reasonably be assumed
that reinstatement to their former positions is no longer possible, or
feasible, or even desired or desirable, the petitioners or their heirs must be
deemed entitled to receive the separation pay provided by said BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337.</p>
