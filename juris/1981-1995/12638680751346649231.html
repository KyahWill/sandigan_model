				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is especially disturbing because officers of the law
are the accused rather than the accusers and there are suspicious overtones of
extortion and official cover-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
victim was <span style="">a
</span>humble law-abiding citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
death could have been hushed <span style="">up </span>and
lightly treated were it not for his widow's determination to bring the
criminals to justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Olympio Galgo was shot to death in Kalookan City, at about 2
o'clock in the morning of March 27, 1971, several investigations were conducted,
resulting in diverse findings and recommendations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two hours after the incident, Pat. Virgilio Gutierrez declared in
a sworn statement that Galgo was killed when he grabbed the former's gun which
went off when they were grappling for it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of this statement, the Kalookan City Police investigator
recommended the filing of an information against Gutierrez, for homicide
through simple negligence.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In response to a complaint lodged by Paula Salceda Galgo, the
victim's widow, the NBI conducted its own investigation and came to a different
conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It recommended the filing of
murder and robbery charges against the four herein accused-appellants, <u>viz</u>.,
Major Raymundo Pascual, Pat. Mario Salvador, Pat. Rustico Morelos, and Pat.
Gutierrez, all of the Kalookan City Police Department.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Acting Fiscal Rogelio de Leon of Kalookan City, after considering
these recommendations, made his own investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 26, 1971, he filed in the Circuit
Criminal Court of Pasig, Rizal, an information for homicide, and against
Gutierrez only.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dissatisfied, the widow appealed to the Department of Justice,
which, after making its own evaluation of the evidence, directed the filing of
an amended information charging Pascual, Gutierrez, Salvador and Morelos with
the crime of murder.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This was done on December 10, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pascual, Morelos and Salvador voluntarily
surrendered and pleaded not guilty at their arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gutierrez failed to appear despite notice,
causing the forfeiture of the bond he had earlier filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was to re-surface later and plead his own
erratic defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution relied heavily on two alleged eyewitnesses,
namely, Wenceslao Rivas,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
an errand boy at the Blue Sky Restaurant owned by the victim, and Eulalia
Villa,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
one of its waitresses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both testified that at about 2 o'clock in the morning of March
27, 1971, Morelos came to the restaurant and asked to talk to the owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Galgo identified himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thereafter agreed to go with Morelos when
told that Major Pascual was waiting for them at the Caltex gas station across
the street.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the way, Galgo was flanked by Morelos and Salvador, who had
joined them, each of them holding Galgo by the shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gutierrez arrived when the three were at the
back of the station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gutierrez kicked
Galgo twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Morelos and Salvador pushed
Galgo down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Major Pascual was at that
time already with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Galgo tried
to rise, he was shot point-blank by Pascual.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rivas and Villa immediately reported the shooting to Mrs. Galgo
and the three of them went to the Kalookan City Police Headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were told that Galgo was in the Kalookan
City General Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There they
learned that the victim had been transferred to the Jose Reyes Memorial
Hospital, where they found Galgo already dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">Villa added that three or four days earlier, Pascual and Salvador
had demanded protection money from Galgo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Galgo had begged to be excused on the ground that his restaurant had
been in operation for less than <span style="">a </span>month.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paula Salceda Galgo corroborated Villa regarding the attempted
extortion and also testified to the damages she sustained as a result of her
husband's death.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two year afterwards, when the prosecution was ready to offer its
exhibits, Gutierrez appeared and entered a plea of not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then moved to dismiss the charge against
him, pointing out that the testimony of Rivas and Villa showed that it was
Pascual who had shot Galgo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the other defendants presented their own witnesses,
among them Rodolfo Marante,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">a </span>dish
washer at the Society Restaurant; Gregorio Manansala,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
an alleged eyewitness; Emily Gliponeo,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>cashier at the Blue Sky Restaurant;
and Ernesto Baltao.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Baltao was the boy Galgo had allegedly slapped, for which act Galgo was being
taken to police headquarters that early morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense version of the killing was a reiteration of the sworn
statement executed by Gutierrez, with Pascual adding that he was at the Society
Restaurant across the Caltex gas station when he heard the shot that killed
Galgo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony was corroborated
by Marante, who said he saw Pascual talking with somebody at that precise
moment when the shot was fired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Manansala testified that it was as Galgo fell from the gunshot that
Pascual came rushing out of the Society Restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emily Gliponeo retracted the statements she
executed at the NBI on March 28, 1971, in which she corroborated Rivas and
Villa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said now that she did not see
the shooting because she never left the Blue Sky Restaurant when she heard the
shot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surprisingly, Gutierrez adopted the defense of his co-accused and
reaffirmed his claim that Galgo was shot when the gun he was trying to wrest
from him went off and hit the victim in the stomach.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Later, however, he again raised the arguments in his motion to dismiss and
pointed to Pascual as Galgo's killer.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his decision dated November 17, 1975, Judge Alberto Q. Ubay
found against all the accused and disposed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the Court finds that the
guilt of all the above-named accused has been proved beyond reasonable doubt
and declares each of them guilty of the crime of murder - the accused Raymundo
Pascual as principal and the three other accused, namely, Rustico Morelos,
Mario Salvador, and Virgilio Gutierrez, as accomplices.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused Raymundo Pascual is hereby sentenced to suffer <span style="">a </span>penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>,
with the accessory penalties prescribed by law; to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased, Olympio Galgo, the amount of one-half of the sum of P12,000.00, or
P6,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Rustico Morelos and
Mario Salvador are hereby each sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of eight
(8) years and twenty (20) days of <u>prison</u> <u>mayor</u>, <span style="">as minimum, </span>to fourteen (14) years,
ten (10) months, and twenty (20) days of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as
maximum, with the accessory penalties provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Virgilio Gutierrez is hereby
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years of <u>prison</u> <u>mayor</u>
as minimum, to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>,
as maximum, with the accessory penalties provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said three accused, namely, Rustico
Morelos, Mario Salvador, and Virgilio Gutierrez, as accomplices, are hereby
ordered to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, Olympio Galgo, jointly and
severally, the sum of P6,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In addition, the decision
awarded the sums of P</span>10,000.00 <span style="">as
moral damages, P72,000.00 as compensatory damages for loss of earnings for four
years, P3,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P550.00 as actual damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All the defendants
appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gutierrez contended that he should
not have been considered an accomplice because he had no prior knowledge of
Pascual's intention to kill Galgo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
their part, Pascual, Morelos and Salvador faulted the trial court for giving
credence to the </span>prosecution witnesses and not to Gutierrez's testimony
that Galgo was shot during their struggle for the gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have said often enough - and we will say it again here - that
much leeway is given to the trial court in assessing the credibility of the
person testifying before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
conclusions on this matter are accorded great weight on appeal <span style="">in </span>the absence of a showing that they
were reached arbitrarily.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court has the opportunity to observe the demeanor of
the witness on the stand and is able to ascertain therefrom whether he is telling
the truth or lying in his teeth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
indicia of veraciousness or perjury - like the flush of face or the tone of
voice or the dart of eyes or the fearful pause - are not discernible from the
sterile record before the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge can see all these tell-tale signs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The line between fact and fabrication is writ
large and bold for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Informed by his
own observations, he can be expected to determine, with reasonable discretion,
whose testimony to accept and which witness to disbelieve.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court that the prosecution's version of
the killing of Olympio Galgo is more credible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rivas and Villa could not simply have concocted their narration of how the
victim was shot down in cold blood by Pascual after being manhandled by the
other accused-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither of
these witnesses had any motive for testifying falsely against any of the
defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they would
have been naturally reluctant to do so, considering that the accused were all
policemen who could easily retaliate against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pascual asserted that Paula Salceda Galgo sought to implicate him
because she was the partner of a woman who had vowed revenge against him when
her massage parlor was raided by the police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is preposterous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By his own
admission, Pascual was not even among those who conducted the raid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is not believable that the widow
would have sought to accuse an innocent man of the serious offense of murder
just to gratify her partner's threat of vengeance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense wonders why if they really saw <span style="">Galgo </span>in
danger, Rivas and Villa did nothing at all to help him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such inaction, it is averred, renders their
testimony suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let us not be
naive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rivas was merely an errand boy
and Villa a waitress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
understandable why they could not face up to the four armed policemen who were
maltreating Galgo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could these simple
folk have dared to intervene when their own employer was helpless in his captors'
hands?</p>

<p class="BODY">There is too much nitpicking with the testimony of these
witnesses, but the inconsistencies cited by the defense are not substantial
enough to impair their credibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rivas was unable to specify the murder weapon because he was not familiar
with firearms and did not know the difference between a pistol and a
revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regarding his delay in
speaking up, he was in fact willing to give his sworn statement earlier but it
was the NBI that decided to take it only 42 days later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for Villa, the discrepancy in the dates of
her sworn statement was explained by NBI agent Godofredo Ayetano as an honest
typographical error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her inablity to
remember the details of the incident, owing to the tension she felt at the time
and the speed of the commission of the crime, did not detract from the
essential veracity of her testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">By contrast, the evidence of the defense <span style="">is a </span>study in inventiveness.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, it is a curious coincidence that all four of the accused-appellants
were together at 2 o'clock in the morning near the restaurant of the victim
when the shooting occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was there a
special operation they were undertaking at that witching hour?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They never said so nor have they
satisfactorily explained why the victim was with them then in the <span style="">gas </span>station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is asked to believe that <span style="">Galgo </span>had been arrested for hitting
Baltao in the neck, but one may well wonder why such drastic action was being
taken for such a minor offense, and at 2 o'clock in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four police officers no less, including a
major who was the Chief of the Administrative Bureau of the Kalookan City
Police Department, effected the arrest of the lone and unarmed Galgo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also incredible that Galgo would have
tried to wrest the gun from Gutierrez after they had left his restaurant when,
assuming he was disposed to resist, he could have done this while he was inside
his own property and with his own relatives and employees to support him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The happenstance that Morante saw Pascual
talking to someone in the Blue Sky Restaurant when they heard the fatal shot
and Morelos saw Pascual leave the restaurant immediately after that shot is
also too pat to be acceptable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear that Pascual's co-accused were only too eager to
exculpate their superior even if their loyalty to him meant lying on the
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a </span>major and the head of their special
operations team, Pascual obviously exerted a great deal of official and also
personal influence upon them.</p>

<p class="BODY">And these henchmen included Gutierrez himself, although he was
rather ambivalent in his declarations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His flip-flopping betrays his unreliability as a witness, not to say a
possible fear of Major Pascual that made him draw suspicion from his chief at
the risk of his own conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, for
all his vacillations, he did not remain intimidated in the end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Revealingly, his final stance was to reject
the role of the scapegoat and to insist that it was not he but Pascual who
fired the shot that killed Galgo.</p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the finding of the trial court that the killer of Galgo
was Pascual, who shot him while he was trying to get up after being pushed to
the ground by Morelos and Salvador.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Galgo was not in <span style="">a </span>position to defend himself at the time the bullet was fired
that ultimately killed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime
committed by Pascual was murder, qualified by treachery as defined in the
Revised Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other aggravating circumstances alleged by the prosecution,
to wit, taking advantage of public position, <span style="">abuse of superior strength, and nocturity, are deemed absorbed in
treachery and cannot be separately considered.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court held that
there was insufficient evidence to prove conspiracy, but we do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts as we read them show quite clearly
that all the accused-appellants came to an agreement concerning the commission
of a felony and decided to commit it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There was a common plan among them to kill
Galgo for his refusal to submit to their extortion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every one had his role in the execution of
that plan when they met at that unseemly hour in the morning of March 27,
1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Morelos was the one who fetched
Galgo from the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Salvador
waited outside and joined Morelos in restraining their quarry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gutierrez soon appeared and administered the
two kicks that began the punishment of Galgo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Morelos and Salvador pushed Galgo forward before the waiting Pascual,
who shot him down in cold blood </span>as <span style="">the
victim attempted to rise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pascual was
indeed the one who pulled the trigger, but the other three accused-appellants
acted in concert with him </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">pursuance of their common design to murder
the helpless Galgo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every one must
therefore suffer the same penalty, for in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">conspiracy the act of
one </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the act of all.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is yet another one of those disturbingly growing number of cases
where policemen, who are supposed to be the protectors of the people, have
instead become their predators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
suggestion that the victim was killed because of his refusal to pay protection
money to the accused makes their offense all the more execrable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is conduct like this that has dissipated
public confidence in the police, who are now often not looked upon with
gratitude and confidence but looked down with suspicion and disdain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policeman must exert earnest efforts to
improve his image as a law-enforcement officer and prove to a long disenchanted
public that the badge he wears is a badge of honor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the
decision of the trial court is partially AFFIRMED, with the modification that
all the accused-appellants, namely, Raymundo Pascual, Rustico Morelos, Mario
Salvador, and Virgilio Gutierrez, as conspirators, are hereby declared equally
guilty of the murder of Olympio Galgo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of them are sentenced to the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
and shall be solidarily liable for the payment to the heirs of Olympio Galgo
civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00 plus all the other monetary awards
specified in the said decision.</p>
