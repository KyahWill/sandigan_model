				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition concerns the orders issued by public respondent 
Secretary of Labor and Employment Franklin M. Drilon denying the appeal 
of petitioners and affirming the compliance order of the Assistant 
Regional Director of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), 
formerly the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  <p> The instant case originated from a complaint filed by Danny 
Gonzaga for and in behalf of 276 other employees against their employer 
T.H. Valderama &amp; Sons, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as petitioner 
company) and/or Roberto Tinsay, dated January 7, 1985 before the Iligan 
City District Office of the Ministry (now Department) of Labor and 
Employment through its Labor Standards Enforcement Unit.</p><p> In their
 complaint, private respondents alleged failure of their employer, 
petitioner company, to pay their salaries, wages, allowances and other 
benefits due them under the applicable laws.  Specifically, they are 
claiming their unpaid wages and emergency cost of living allowance 
(ECOLA) covering the period of November and December 1984; underpayment 
of their wages and ECOLA for three years; and non-payment and 
underpayment of their 13th month pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p><p>
 By reason of this complaint, on February 4, 1985, Labor Standards 
Enforcement Unit officers Somirano Macud and Cornelia Garay went to the 
premises of petitioner company to conduct an investigation.  There, they
 were met by Ireneo Clarida, personnel aide of petitioner company, and 
were informed that the manager was not around.  The following day, the 
said labor officers went back to petitioner company's premises but, 
again, were told that the manager was out.  Thereupon, the labor 
officers conducted their investigation and came out with a report<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which was submitted to the 
Regional Director of the MOLE, Region XII, Cotabato City.</p><p> In the 
said report, the following findings were made:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "1.  That respondents violated Sec. 11 Rule X, Book III of the 
Rules Implementing PD 442, as amended, requiring employers to keep their
 employment records in their premises;</p>
    <p> 4.  That complainants were underpaid of their 13th month pay."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> After computing the amount of private respondents' claim, the 
Labor Standards Enforcement Unit set the amount of petitioner company's 
liability at the aggregate sum of ONE MILLION NINE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT 
THOUSAND &amp; 92/100 (P1,928,000.92).</p><p> On the basis of the 
aforesaid report, Assistant Regional Director Martin E. Daiz of the MOLE
 issued a Compliance Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
dated May 28, 1985 requiring petitioner company to pay its liability as 
computed.</p><p> Thereafter, or on July 15, 1985, private respondents 
filed a motion for execution of the compliance order.  A day after, a 
writ of execution was issued by the Regional Director.</p><p> In due 
time, petitioners filed an urgent motion to recall writ of execution 
and/or reconsideration dated August 21, 1986 attaching and submitting 
therewith some pay slips and daily time records showing that some of 
private respondents’ claim had already been paid or otherwise satisfied.
  Acting on the said motion, the Regional Director reduced the amount of
 petitioners' liability to ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED NINETY-FIVE THOUSAND
 THREE &amp; 70/100 (P1,495,003.70).</p><p> In the light of the 
foregoing development, the Regional Director called for a summary 
investigation of the controversy.  Petitioners failed to appear therein,
 henceforth, a writ of execution was issued to satisfy the claims of 
private respondents.</p><p> This was appealed to the then Minister of 
Labor and Employment Augusto Sanchez who, in an order dated November 14,
 1986, ruled against petitioner company.  The dispositive portion of the
 order reads as follows:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Compliance Order dated May 
28, 1985 is hereby affirmed subject to the modification that the award 
therein be reduced to P1,495,003.70 as recomputed.  Let the entire 
records be remanded to the Regional Office of origin for enforcement of 
the said order which had become final and executory.</p>
    <p> SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> A motion for reconsideration of the immediately preceding order 
was filed but the same was denied by respondent Secretary Franklin 
Drilon on March 12, 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
Hence, this petition for <em>certiorari.</em>
  </p><p> The only issue posed in this instant petition is whether 
petitioners were denied their right to procedural due process.</p><p> 
Petitioners posit the affirmative.  However, We find their contention 
bereft of merit.</p><p> There is no denying that in order for this Court
 to sustain the findings of an administrative body exercising 
quasi-judicial functions, such body must abide by the elementary rules 
of due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>. However, 
procedural due process as understood in administrative proceedings 
accepts of a more flexible standard as long as the proceedings were 
undertaken in an atmosphere of fairness and justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></p><p> Contrary  to petitioners assertion, 
the record discloses that they were not denied their right to due 
process.  They had several opportunities to present their side of the 
controversy but were negligent in defending their cause.</p><p> As borne
 by the record, after the narrative report was forwarded by the Labor 
Standards Enforcement Unit to the Office of the Regional Director, a 
hearing was scheduled on February 8, 1985 for petitioners to dispute the
 report thus submitted.  However on the scheduled hearing, petitioners 
failed to appear.</p><p> Likewise, in the summary investigation that was
 scheduled on May 20, 1986 for the purpose of hearing the parties 
relative to the amount of petitioner company's liability as recomputed, 
petitioners, again, did not appear despite due notice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p><p> Petitioners vehemently deny that 
notices of the aforestated proceedings were ever sent to them.  This 
failure of notice is in fact the core of their argument in their 
petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p><p> At any 
rate, We need not discuss the truthfulness of this assertion.  As the 
record will reveal, petitioners were afforded ample opportunity to 
present their side of the case.  Petitioners were able to submit pay 
slips and daily time records to the appropriate agency of the DOLE which
 became the basis of the recomputation conducted.  Besides, they were 
able to appeal the compliance order and writ of execution to the then 
Minister of Labor Sanchez. There was also a motion for reconsideration 
which they filed with Secretary Drilon.</p><p> As already ruled by this 
Court, denial of due process cannot be successfully invoked where a 
party was given the chance to be heard on his motion for 
reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
Petitioners’ appeal and their subsequent motion for reconsideration have
 the effect of curing whatever irregularity was committed in the 
proceedings below.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p><p> 
After a careful deliberation on the facts and issue thus posed, this 
Court finds no reason to disturb the assailed order.</p><p> <strong>WHEREFORE</strong>,
 the instant petition is hereby <em>DISMISSED</em> for lack of merit, 
with costs against petitioners.
