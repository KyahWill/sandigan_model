				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Republic of the Philippines appealed in 1978 from the 1976 and 1977 decisions of the Court of Appeals regarding the auction sale of the <u>SS Da Gama</u> over which Soledad Quintos and Sunripe Coconut Products, Inc. had claims. The case was docketed as L-47381.<br><br>Crest Shipping Co., Inc., a New York corporation, filed on January 5, 1978 with <u>this Court</u> a petition for <u>certiorari, mandamus</u> and prohibition for the nullification of the auction sale. This was docketed as L-47420. The two cases were consolidated. Crest Shipping was ultimately excluded from these proceedings.<br><br>On January 16, 1985, the parties filed the following compromise agreement dated August 6, 1984 which is quoted in full below:<br><blockquote><center>"COMPROMISE AGREEMENT</center><br>"COME NOW the petitioner, the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Minister of Education and Culture, and the private respondent, Sunripe Coconut Products, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Sunripe, for brevity), represented by Mr. Francisco Chua, President and General Manager, assisted by their respective counsel, to this Honorable Court respectfully manifest:<br><br>"WHEREAS, this case has been under litigation since July 1972 starting from the Court of First Instance of Manila, appealed to the Court of Appeals, and now with this Honorable Court where petitioner has questioned the validity and regularity of the public auction sale of the subject vessel, the SS 'DA GAMA', conducted by respondent Sheriff on July 12, 1972 upon order of the respondent Court of First Instance, and where both the latter court and respondent Court of Appeals have ruled said sale to be valid;<br><br>"WHEREAS, the petitioner assailed the sale at public auction referred to before the Court of First Instance, the Court of Appeals, and now with this Honorable Court, because said sale yielded merely an awarded bid of P505,100.00 which petitioner considered to be grossly out of proportion to the actual worth of subject vessel at the time, estimated at the minimum of $210,000.00, or roughly P1,400,000.00 (Petition, pp. 14-27);<br><br>“WHEREAS, because respondent Sunripe has since the beginning substituted the winning bidder, respondent Soledad Quintos, who sold and assigned her rights over the subject vessel to the former, it has defended the validity and regularity of said sale all these years, retaining counsel and attending as well to security, maintenance, and dewatering of the vessel, prior to its turnover to, and scrapping by, the Iligan Integrated Steel Mills, Inc. (IISMI) pursuant to Letter of Instruction No. 131 dated September 19, 1973 (Petition, pp. 8-9); Sunripe's expenditures amounted to no less than P931,908.23 as of 1977;<br><br>"WHEREAS, the IISMI has in fact accomplished such scrapping, the proceeds of which, together with the sale of non-ferrous metals as well as equipment recovered from the vessel, have been deposited in an interest bearing account with the Philippine National Bank (PNB) starting from March, 1974, and which combined amounts including interests earned total P4,712,389.26 as of February 29, 1984 (see xerox copy of PNB certification attached as Annex ‘A’ hereof ):<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td colspan="4"><div align="center"><u>"ANNEX A</u></div></td></tr><tr><td width="28%">&nbsp;</td><td width="22%">&nbsp;</td><td width="25%">&nbsp;</td><td width="25%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><div align="center">"PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK<br><br>&nbsp; Official Depository of the Republic of the Philippines<br><br>&nbsp; Cashier's Department</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>March 20, 1984</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>"Mr. Rogelio G.
