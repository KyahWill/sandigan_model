dated September 23,1992 denying petitioner's Petition and affirming the
Decision and Resolution promulgated on March 9, 1992 and June 26, 1992, respectively,
of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP. No. 26305.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The CA Decision and Resolution upheld the following: (1) respondent Judge
Benjamin V. Pelayo's Order dated September 4, 1991 which denied petitioner's
Motion for Recusation: and (2) respondent judge's Order dated September 17,
1991 denying petitioner's Motion to Suspend Proceedings and to Transfer Venue
Outside Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the antecedent facts of this case, particularly those
wherein respondent Judge participated, is in Order to arrive at a just and
correct assessment of his acts vis-a-vis the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 2, 1991, Eldon Maguan was shot inside his car along
Wilson Street, San Juan, Metro Manila.  After conducting an investigation of the shooting incident, the police
identified petitioner Rolito (o as the prime suspect in the commission of the
crime.  On July 8, 1991, petitioner,
accompanied by two lawyers, presented himself before the San Juan Police
Station.  He was arrested and booked for
the shooting of Maguan.  The police filed
a complaint for frustrated homicide with the Office of the Provincial
Prosecutor of Rizal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 11, 1991, an information for murder was filed against
petitioner before the Regional Trial Court, Pasig, Metro Manila, the victim
Eldon Maguan having died on July 9, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day July 11, 1991, counsel for petitioner filed with
the Prosecutor an omnibus motion praying for petitioner's immediate release and
for a preliminary investigation.  Provincial Prosecutor Mauro Castro interposed no objection to
petitioner's being granted provisional liberty on a cash bond of <s>P</s>100,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was raffled to the sala of respondent judge, the Hon.
Benjamin V. Pelayo, who, on July 12, 1991, approved the cash bond posted by
petitioner and ordered his release.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 16, 1991, respondent judge issued an Order granting leave
for the Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal to conduct a preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on July 17, 1991, respondent judge <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u>
issued an Order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
which: (a) recalled the July 12, 1991 Order granting bail; (b) directed
petitioner to surrender within 48 hours from notice; (c) cancelled the July 16,
1991 Order granting leave for the Provincial Prosecutor to conduct a
preliminary investigation; (d) treated petitioner's omnibus motion for
immediate release and preliminary investigation dated July 11, 1991 as a
petition for bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1991, petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> questioning the July 17, 1991 Order of
respondent judge.  On the same day, petitioner
filed before the trial court a motion to suspend all the proceedings pending
the resolution of the petition filed before the Supreme Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">On July 23, 1991, petitioner voluntarily surrendered to the CAPCOM.  Upon motions<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

as the Court shall have properly determined the place where accused should be
detained."</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 29, 1991, the National Bureau of Investigation wrote a
letter<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to the trial court requesting that custody of petitioner be transferred to the
Bureau in view of an investigation for illegal possession of firearms involving
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, July 29, 1991, the trial court issued an Order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

during office hours and petitioner is to be returned to the custody of the
CAPCOM at the end of each day; and (c) the NBI should report to the trial court
the status of the investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 30, 1991, petitioner filed a motion<a style="mso-footnote-id:

before the trial court praying that the Order dated July 29, 1991 be nullified
and recalled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, July 31, 1991, the NBI filed a motion<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

was issued by the trial Court dated August 1, 1991 setting for hearing the
issue concerning the proper venue of petitioner's detention.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the hearing on petitioner's custody, the trial court issued
an Order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
dated August 2, 1991 ordering the CAPCOM to bring the person of petitioner to
the court not later than August 5, 1991 so that a commitment order for his

praying that respondent judge inhibit himself from hearing the case.  The motion was denied by respondent judge in
his Order dated September 4, 1991.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 22, 1991, petitioner filed a Motion to Suspend

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, this Court, by Resolution dated July, 24, 1991,
remanded to the Court of Appeals the petition filed by petitioner assailing the
July 17, 1991 Order of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 27, 1991, petitioner filed a petition for <i>habeas</i>
<i>corpus</i> before the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 23, 1991, the Court of Appeals rendered a
consolidated decision dismissing the two petitions.  However, upon petition by petitioner, this Court by an 8-6 vote
in G.R. No. 101837 issued a decision reversing the CA decision and ordering (a)
the Provincial Prosecutor to conduct a preliminary investigation; and (b) the
release of petitioner without prejudice to any order that the trial court may
issue, should the Provincial Prosecutor move for cancellation of bail at the
conclusion of the preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After conducting a preliminary investigation pursuant to this
Court's decision in G.R. No. 101837, the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor issued
a Resolution dated February 27, 1992 finding probable cause to charge
petitioner with the crime of murder.  The Resolution was approved by the Provincial Prosecutor who filed with
the trial court a motion to cancel the bail of petitioner and a motion to set
the criminal case for resumption of the trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner attempted to have the Resolution of the Prosecutor
reversed by appealing to the Department of Justice, and filing petitions with
the Court of Appeals (CA, G.R. SP No. 27738) and finally to this Court (G.R.
No. 105424), but his efforts did not meet with success.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 1, 1991, petitioner filed another petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> before this Court seeking to annul: (1) the
Order of, the trial court dated September 4, 1991 denying petitioner's Motion
for Recusation; and (2) the Order dated September 17, 1991 denying petitioner's
Motion to Suspend Proceedings and Transfer Venue Outside Metro Manila.  The petition, docketed as G.R. No. 101772,
was remanded to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 9, 1992, the Court of Appeals (13th Division) rendered a
decision dismissing the petition.  As to
the denial of petitioner's Motion for Recusation, the Court of Appeals held in
part:</p>

<blockquote>"On the basis of the allegation of the petition, the Court is
not inclined to strike down the denial of petitioner's motion for recusation as
a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the respondent judge absent any
clear showing of such grave abuse of his discretion.  The allegation of petitioner in support of his motion for
recusation are conclusions based on his own fears and are therefore
speculations than anything else.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In order to warrant a finding of 'prejudicial' publicity as urged
by the petitioner, there must be allegation and <u>proof</u> <u>that</u><i> </i><u>the</u>
<u>judge</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>unduly</u> <u>influenced</u>, not simply
that he might be, by the "barrage" of publicity (Martelino vs.
Alejandro, 32 SCRA 106; emphasis supplied).  While there is such allegation in the petition, the Court has however found
no proof so far adduced sufficient to accept the petitioner's claim that the
respondent judge has been unduly influenced by the alleged publicity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Additionally, We quote hereunder the pronouncement of the Supreme
Court in the case of Aparicio vs. Andal, 175 SCRA 569 where, citing the case of
Pimentel vs. Salanga, 21 SCRA 160, it said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Efforts to attain fair, just and impartial trial and decision, have
a natural and alluring appeal.  But, we
are not licensed to indulge in unjustified assumptions, or make a speculative
approval to this ideal.  It ill behooves
this Court to tar and feather a judge as biased or prejudiced, simply because
counsel for a party litigant happens to complain against him.  As applied here, respondent judge has not as
yet crossed the line that divides partiality and impartiality.  He has not thus far stepped to one side of
the fulcrum.  No act or conduct of his
would show arbitrariness or prejudice.  Therefore, we are not to assume what respondent judge, not otherwise
legally disqualified, will do in a case before him.  We have had occasion to rule in a criminal case that a charge
made before trial that a party ‘will not be given a fair, impartial and just
hearing’ is 'premature.' Prejudice is not to be presumed.  Especially if weighed against a judge's
legal obligation under his oath to administer justice without respect to person
and to equal right to the poor and the rich.’  To disqualify or not to disqualify himself then, as far as respondent
judge is concerned, is a matter of conscience."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals also sustained the trial court's denial of
petitioner's Motion to Suspend Proceedings and Transfer  Venue Outside Metro Manila with the
following pronouncement:</p>

<blockquote>"On the question of the denial by the respondent court of
petitioner's motion to suspend proceedings and transfer venue outside of Metro
Manila; suffice it to say that the respondent court was correct in denying
petitioner's motion.  For indeed, the
authority to order a change of venue or place of trial to avoid a miscarriage
of justice is vested in the Supreme Court by Article VIII, Section 5, paragraph
4 of the Constitution.  Neither the
respondent court nor this Court has the authority to grant petitioner's motion
for transfer of venue.  The cases cited
by petitioner in support of <u>this</u> <u>issue</u> were all decided by the
Supreme Court before the advent of the 1973 Constitution where the provision on
transfer of venue was first adopted, hence not applicable to the instant
case."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of the CA decision having
been denied,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
a petition under Rule 45 was filed before this Court on July 29, 1992 assailing
the decision of the Court of Appeals.  On September 9, 1992, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG),
representing respondent People of the Philippines, filed a Comment on the
Petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 23, 1992, the Court, after considering the
allegations contained, issues raised and the arguments adduced in the Petition,
as well as the Comment filed by the OSG, issued a Resolution denying the
Petition on the ground that the respondent Court of Appeals committed no
reversible error in its assailed decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 12, 1992, the present Motion for Reconsideration<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
was filed in which petitioner reiterates his position that respondent judge should
inhibit himself from the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 16, 1992, petitioner filed a pleading captioned
"Urgent Motion (for preliminary mandatory injunction)." In said
Motion, petitioner questioned the Order of the trial court dated December 9,
1992 denying petitioner's Motion to Reopen Hearing (of the cancellation of bail
proceedings) and to Present Last Witness.  It appears that after the presentation of eleven (11) witnesses by the
prosecution and six (6) by the defense, the trial court considered the question
concerning the cancellation of petitioner's bail ripe for resolution.  Thereafter, petitioner filed a Motion to
Reopen and Present Last Witness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
But the trial court issued an Order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
dated December 9, 1992 which, among other things, denied the Motion.  In the Urgent Motion filed with this Court
on December 16, 1992, petitioner prayed "for the issuance forthwith and ex
parte of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction directing respondent judge
to allow petitioner to complete his defense evidence by presenting his <u style="text-underline:words">last</u> witness on the bail issue..."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

issuing a temporary restraining order (TRO) restraining respondent judge from
resolving the bail issue and directing him to allow petitioner to present his
last witness.  This Resolution was
clarified and the TRO confirmed in another Resolution issued by the Court on
January 11, 1993.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 8, 1993, the OSG filed a Comment on petitioner's
Motion for Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it is noteworthy to observe that petitioner in
this Motion for Reconsideration no longer raises the question of change of
venue.  Moreover, the Motion for
Reconsideration is predicated on what petitioner alleges are "the
supervening events demonstrating partiality to the prosecution, on one hand,
and hostility against petitioner, on the other."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Perforce, this Resolution shall only consider the allegations and issues raised
in this Motion for Reconsideration and in the Comment thereon filed by the OSG.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's Motion for Recusation filed before the trial court
is based on Rule 137, sec. 1, par. 2 of the Rules of Court on disqualification
of judges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution commands that in all criminal prosecutions, the
accused shall enjoy the right to have "a speedy, <u>impartial</u>, and
public trial."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied) This right is a derivation and elaboration of the more
fundamental right to due process of law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
The rule on the disqualification of judges is a mechanism for enforcing the
requirements of due process.  "It
is now beyond dispute that due process cannot be satisfied in the absence of
that degree of objectivity on the part of a judge sufficient to reassure
litigants of his being fair and being just.  Thereby there is the legitimate expectation that the decision arrived at
would be the application of the law to the facts as found by a judge who does
not play favorites.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

although required primarily for the benefit of the litigants, is also designed
to preserve the integrity of the judiciary and more fundamentally, to gain and
maintain the people's faith in the institutions they have erected when they
adopted our Constitution.  The notion
that "justice must satisfy the appearance of justice"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
is an imposition by the citizenry, as the final judge of the conduct of public
business, including trials, upon the courts of a high and uncompromising
standard in the proper dispensation of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">While bias and<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>prejudice,

<p class="BODY">In the Motion for Reconsideration now before the Court,
petitioner, to prove his allegation of bias on the part of respondent judge,
takes the latter to task for continuing with the trial during the pendency of
this petition stating that:</p>

<blockquote>"Even as the instant petition for the trial judge's recusation
pends, the latter did not see fit to suspend the hearings.  Indeed the trial judge has been conducting

137, sec. 2 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"If it be claimed that an official is disqualified from

we stated that if a judge denies the motion for disqualification and rules
favorably on his competency to try the case, it becomes a matter of official
duty for him to proceed with the trial and decision of the case.  He cannot shirk the responsibility without
the risk of being called upon to account for his dereliction.  Although this case was decided prior to the
introduction of par. 2 of Rule 137, sec. 1, there is no reason why the
procedure laid down in Rule, 137, sec. 2 and applied in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u>

pursuant to Rule 137, sec. 1, par. 2.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>

the Court applied the procedure prescribed in Rule 137, sec. 2 when the trial
judge denied a party's motion for inhibition under Rule 137, sec. 1, par thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the trial judge acted correctly in proceeding with
the case by setting it for pre-trial since it is within her sound discretion,
after her decision in favor of her own competency, to either proceed with the
trial or refrain from acting on the case until determination of the issue of
her disqualification by the appellate court [Section 2 of Rule 137 of the
Revised Rules of Court; De la Paz v. Intermediate Appellate Court, <u>supra</u>,

<p class="BODY">Hence, if the trial judge decides to deny a motion for inhibition
based on Rule 137, sec. 1, par. 2, he shall proceed with the trial, unless of
course restrained by either the Court of Appeals or by this Court.  The mere filing of a motion for inhibition
before the trial court or a petition before either the Court of Appeals or the
Supreme Court challenging an order of the trial judge denying a motion for
inhibition will not deprive the judge of authority to proceed with the case.  Otherwise, by the expedient of filing such
motion or petition, although the same be lacking in merit, a party can unduly
delay the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the case at hand,
respondent judge acted in accordance with the Rules and prevailing
jurisprudence when he proceeded with the trial after denying petitioner's
Motion for Recusation.  Petitioner
cannot, therefore, cite the fact that, respondent judge did not suspend hearing
the case during the pendency of this petition as proof of his claim that the
judge is partial.  This Court has not in
connection with the petition, issued a temporary restraining order (TRO)
enjoining respondent judge from further hearing the case.  The TRO which this Court issued on December
29, 1992 after the petition was denied and pending this Motion for Reconsideration
ordered the judge to desist from resolving the question on the cancellation of
bail until the last witness of petitioner was heard.  The TRO did not restrain the judge from hearing the case.  On the contrary, the judge was ordered to
hear petitioner's last witness in the cancellation of bail proceedings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
Because it was his duty to continue trying the case and there was no order from
this Court not to do so, respondent judge committed no impropriety evincing
partiality when he continued hearing the case during the pendency of the
petition before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in this Motion for Reconsideration, claims that since
the issuance of the Court Resolution dated September 23, 1992 denying his
Petition, there have been "supervening events demonstrating partiality to
the prosecution on one hand, and hostility against petitioner, on the other
hand."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner alleges:</p>

<blockquote>"Pursuing his unconstitutional bent first evinced when,
without benefit of preliminary investigation; petitioner's arraignment and
trial, then arrest and detention for almost a year was peremptorily ordered -
which this Court reversed and rebuked (G.R. no. 101837, promulgated 11 February
1992) - the unchastened trial judge let out yet with two palpably biased and
hostile orders, <u>infra</u>, clearly and unmistakably demonstrating an
unconstitutional prejudgment of petitioner's culpability.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first of these allegedly "palpably biased and hostile
orders" was that issued by respondent judge on August 14, 1992 overruling
petitioner's objection to the admissibility, of an affidavit of Geronimo
Gonzaga offered by the prosecution.  Petitioner contends that respondent judge should not have admitted the
extrajudicial statements of Gonzaga because the latter did not take the witness
stand to affirm the statements contained in the document presented by the
prosecution.  Petitioner suspected that
respondent judge was trying to bolster the evidence for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is without merit.  The mere fact that the trial judge overruled petitioner's
objection to the admissibility of a particular piece of evidence is not proof
of bias.  In <u>Jandionco</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Peñaranda</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that "[d]ivergence of opinions between a judge hearing a case
and a party's counsel, as to applicable laws and jurisprudence, is not a
sufficient ground to disqualify the judge from hearing the case on the ground
of bias and manifest partiality.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn48" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
If petitioner disagrees with the judge's ruling, he may still question the
admissibility of the evidence when he files an appeal, in case a judgment of
conviction is rendered.  To conclude,
however, that respondent judge, by overruling the objection raised by
petitioner's counsel, was trying to strengthen the prosecution's evidence is
not only baseless because there was no evidence given to support this
conclusion, but also premature because at that stage, the judge was not yet
appreciating the merits and weight of the particular piece of evidence in
question but was merely ruling on its admissibility.  Petitioner's conclusion that "the offer and admission of
Gonzaga's hearsay 'eyewitness' statement suggest a sinister, concert to
simulate evidential strength"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn49" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
is, if not suggestive of paranoia, at the very least, an overreaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other supervening event allegedly demonstrating the judge's
partiality occurred during one of the hearings concerning the prosecution's
motion for the cancellation of petitioner's bail.  On September 28, 1992, after eleven (11) witnesses had been
presented for the prosecution and two (2) for the defense, respondent judge
considered the cancellation of hail proceedings ripe for resolution and refused
to allow petitioner's counsel to present anymore witnesses.  The reasons given by respondent judge for
his ruling were: (1) the proceeding in the cancellation of bail is summary and
different from the hearing on the merits; (2) the court need not receive
exactly the same number of witnesses from both the prosecution and the defense:
and (3) the counsel for petitioner previously limited himself to two (2)
witnesses as borne out by the record of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn50" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge is correct in appreciating the nature of the
bail proceedings. "[T]he hearing of an application for bail should be
summary or otherwise in the discretion of the court.  By ‘summary hearing’ [is] meant such brief and speedy method of
receiving and considering the evidence of guilt as is practicable and
consistent with the purpose of the hearing which is merely to determine the
weight of the evidence for the purpose of bail.  In such a hearing, the court ‘does not sit to try the merits or
to enter into any nice inquiry as to the weight that ought to be allowed to the
evidence for or against accused, nor will it speculate on the outcome of the
trial or on what further evidence may he therein offered is admitted.’ ....The
course of the inquiry may be left to the discretion of the court which may
confine itself to receiving such evidence as has reference to substantial
matters avoiding unnecessary thoroughness in the examination and cross-examination
of witnesses and reducing to a reasonable minimum the amount of corroboration
particularly on details that are not essential to the purpose of the
hearing."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn51" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the proceedings conducted by respondent judge were not
for an application for bail but to cancel that which was issued to petitioner,
the principles and procedure governing hearings on an application for bail were
correctly applied by respondent judge in the cancellation of bail proceedings
since the bail was issued by this Court in G.R. No. 101837 without prejudice to
any lawful order which the trial court may issue in case the Provincial
Prosecutor moves for the cancellation of the bail.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn52" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>
The grant of bail was made without prejudice because where bail is not a matter
of right, as in this case, the prosecution must be given the opportunity to
prove that there is a strong evidence of guilt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn53" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
In the cancellation of bail proceedings before him, the judge was confronted
with the same issue as in an application for bail, i.e., whether the evidence
of guilt is so strong as to convince the court that the accused is not entitled
to bail.  Hence, the similarity of the
nature and procedure of the hearings for an application for bail and the
cancellation of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having determined that respondent judge made a proper
appreciation of the nature of the bail proceedings before him, we likewise hold
that it was within his discretion to limit the number of witnesses for
petitioner.  The power of the court in
the bail proceedings to make a determination as to whether or not the evidence
of guilt is strong "implies a full exercise of judicial discretion.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn54" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
If the trial judge believes that the evidence before him is sufficient for him
to rule on the bail issue, after giving both parties their opportunity to present
evidence, it is within his authority to consider the bail proceedings ripe for
resolution.  In any case, respondent
judge acceded to petitioner's request and allowed him to present more witnesses
in the bail proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the Court holds that the respondent judge's ruling on
September 28, 1992 considering the prosecution's motion for cancellation of
bail ripe for resolution on the basis of the evidence already presented was not
motivated by bias or prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner, in this Motion for Reconsideration, restates
his argument in the Petition that the respondent judge is biased, as evidenced
by his Order dated July 17, 1991<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn55" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
which in effect allowed petitioner's arraignment and trial without the benefit
of a preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in <u>Go</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,
<u>et</u>. <u>al</u>., G.R. No. 101837.  February 11, 1992, a divided Court nullified respondent judge's July 17,
1991 Order and ordered that a preliminary investigation be conducted.  But the erroneous Order of respondent judge
is not necessarily proof of partiality.  In <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Lacson</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn56" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>,
we held that erroneous rulings do not always constitute evidence of bias.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn57" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
In <u>Luciano</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Mariano</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn58" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a>
we made the pronouncement that "[t]he mere fact that the judge has
erroneously ruled against the same litigant on two or more occasions does not
create in our minds a decisive pattern of malice on the part of the judge
against that particular litigant.  This
is not an unusual occurrence in our courts…" Moreover, the fact that the
erroneous order issued by a judge can be remedied and was actually corrected,
as in this case, militates against the disqualification of the judge on the
ground of bias or partiality.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn59" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have earlier underscored the importance of the rule of
disqualification of judges, not only in safeguarding the rights of litigants to
due process of law but also in earning for the judiciary the people's
confidence, an <span style="color:windowtext">element</span> so essential in
the effective administration of justice.  The rule should, therefore, not be used cavalierly to suit a litigant's
personal designs or to defeat the ends of justice.  "While We are exacting on the conduct of judges confronted
with motions for disqualifications.  We
cannot, however, tolerate acts of litigants who, for any conceivable reason,
seek to disqualify a judge for their own purpose, under a plea of bias,
hostility, prejudice or prejudgment. . .  [T]his Court does not approve the tactic of some litigants of filing of
baseless motion for disqualification of the judge as a Means of delaying the case
and/or of forum-shopping for a more friendly judge.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn60" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at hand, the Motion for Recusation filed by
petitioner must be viewed in the light of his lawyers’ many attempts to suspend
the proceedings before the respondent judge.  Before the trial court, petitioner tried at least eight (8) times, not
merely to reset the scheduled hearings,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn61" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>
but to suspend the trial of the case itself.  The following pleadings filed by petitioner before respondent judge all
prayed either to suspend the proceedings entirely or for the respondent judge
to delay the disposition of a particular issue:</p>

<p class="BODY">Before this Court, petitioner has already filed three (3) petitions
assailing various orders of respondent judge in connection with the single
murder case pending against him.  Apart
from the present petition which is docketed as G.R. No. 106087, petitioner has
previously filed two (2) other petitions docketed as G.R. Nos. 101837 and
105424.  In all three (3) petitions,
petitioner applied for a temporary restraining order to have the proceedings
before the trial court held in abeyance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The murder case involving only one accused, the petitioner, has
become unnecessarily complicated and the proceedings before the trial court
protracted, as can be gleaned from the fact that between the filing of the
information on July 11, 1991 and the end of last year or December 31, 1992, the
records of the case now consist of four (4) volumes and the transcript of
stenographic notes have reached a total of one thousand five hundred and twenty
three (1523) pages.  Hearings are still
being conducted.</p>

<p class="BODY">When taken in the light of petitioner's repeated attempts to have
the proceedings in the murder case suspended and his lawyers’ transparent
maneuvers for the needless protraction of the case, the Motion for Recusation
can only be viewed as another dilatory move and the present Motion for
Reconsideration a further ploy to stall hearings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, after a careful examination of the records of the case,
including the transcript of stenographic notes, and considering the applicable
law, the pertinent rules and prevailing jurisprudence, we reiterate our holding
in the Court Resolution dated September 23, 1992 that the Court of Appeals
committed no reversible error in affirming the respondent judge's Order which
denied petitioner's Motion for Recusation.  This extended Resolution should put an end to petitioner's obvious
attempts at deferring the trial of his principal case by dwelling on incidental
matters.  The motion for reconsideration
must perforce, he denied with finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Comment on the petitioner's Motion for Recusation, the
Solicitor General prays that Attys. Raymundo A. Armovit, Miguel R. Armovit and
Rafael Armovit, be disciplinarily dealt with by this Court for allegedly using
abusive and intemperate language against respondent judge which betrays
disrespect to the trial court.</p>

under contract to do the prosecution's bidding;" (2) "evinced
contempt for Supreme Court case law;" and (3) "dishonored his
judicial oath and duty to hear before he condemns, proceed upon inquiry, and
render judgment on a man's liberty only after a full trial of the facts."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn65" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Rules of Court commands members of the bar "[t]o observe
and maintain the respect due to the courts of justice and judicial
officers."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn66" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a>
Reinforcing this rule of conduct is the Code of Professional Responsibility
which states in Canon 11 the following: "A lawyer shall observe and
maintain the respect due to the courts and to judicial officers and should
insist on similar conduct by others." Rule 11.03 of the Code further
states: "A lawyer shall abstain from scandalous, offensive or menacing
language or behaviour before the courts." The next succeeding rule, Rule
11.03 adds: "A lawyer shall not attribute to a judge motives not supported
by the record or having materiality to the case."</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the adversarial nature of our legal system has
tempted members of the bar, in pursuing their duty to advance the interests of
their clients, to use strong language.  But this privilege is not a license to malign our courts of
justice.  Irreverent behavior towards
the courts by members of the bar is proscribed, not so much for the sake of the
temporary incumbent of the judicial office, but more importantly, for the
maintenance of respect for our judicial system, so necessary for the country's
stability.  "Time and again, this
Court has admonished, and punished, in varying degrees, members of the bar for
statements, disrespectful or irreverent, acrimonious or defamatory, of this
Court or the lower courts…  To be sure,
lawyers may come up with various methods, perhaps more effective, in calling
the Court's attention to the issues involved.  The language vehicle does not run short of expressions, emphatic but
respectful, convincing but not derogatory, illuminating but not offensive.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn67" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In light of the above doctrines and jurisprudence, as well as the
inherent power and authority of this Court to cite members of the Bar in
contempt and to discipline them, we are of the opinion that the language used
by petitioner's lawyers is highly derogatory, offensive” and contemptuous.</p>

Justice Hilario G. Davide, Jr. was on leave while the <i>ponente</i>
dissented.  During the deliberations on
petitioner's Urgent Motion (for preliminary mandatory injunction), the <i>ponente</i>
expressed the following reasons for her dissent to the Resolution: (1) the
trial court's Order of December 16, 1992 denying petitioner's Motion to Reopen
and Present Last Witness is not the subject of the present petition and cannot
be dealt with here the instant petition concerns the Court of Appeals decision
upholding the trial court's Order dated September 4, 1991 denying petitioner's
Motion for Recusation and Order dated September 17, 1991 denying petitioner's
Motion to Suspend Proceedings and to Transfer Venue Outside Metro Manila; and
(2) petitioner failed to show that his last witness could not have been
presented before the trial court considered the cancellation for bail
proceedings submitted for resolution.</p>

Armovit composed of Attys. Raymundo A. Armovit, Miguel R. Armovit and Rafael R.
Armovit, on behalf of petitioner.  On October

1992, Atty. Prospero A. Cresini substituted Atty. Ambrosio.   In this present Motion for Reconsideration,
petitioner is represented by the Law Firm of Atty. Raymundo A. Armovit again.</p>
