Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
Branch VII, with violation of Section 4, Art. II in relation to Section 2, par.
(e), No. 1 and par. (1), Article I of RA No. 6425, as amended, otherwise known
as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
information filed against him reads:</p>

Enrique, <span style="">Jr., </span>y <span class="SpellE">Gumtang</span>, not being authorized by law to sell, deliver, give

Integrated National Police (INP) and assigned with the 2nd Narcotics Regional

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused entered a plea of not guilty to the
crime charged (Records, <span style="">p. </span>67).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial on the merits, the court rendered
its decision on <st1:date month="9" day="14" year="1989">September 14, 1989</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts as found by the trial court are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the records, briefly stated, the court finds the
following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the information
supplied by the civilian informer whose identity cannot be divulged for <span class="GramE">security reason</span> that one alias Bong of <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> was engaged <span style="">in </span>selling marijuana cigarettes, a team composed of Pat. <span class="GramE">Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Quebalayan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, both of the 2nd
Narcotic Unit, Regional Command, <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> and Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> of the INP <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> was organized.<span style="">&nbsp;

acted as poser buyer; <span class="GramE">A</span> marked P10.00 bill with Serial

on <st1:date month="5" day="9" year="1988">May 9, 1988</st1:date>, the suspect
Alias Bong was approached by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Natividad</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bong handed
something to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> who in turn handed the
marked <span style="">P10.00 </span>bill; <span class="GramE">After</span> confirming that the thing handed was a marijuana
cigarette, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> gave the pre-arranged
signal to the team headed by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Quebalayan</span> to
close-in and <span class="GramE">effect</span> his arrest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The items, Exhibit ‘B-1’ to 'B-5' (rolled cigarettes) after a
field test was found positive of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In like manner, <span class="SpellE">Pol</span><span class="GramE">./</span>Capt.
Benjamin Rubio, Bio-Chemist, Chief of the PC/INP Crime Laboratory Service based
<span style="">at </span><span class="SpellE">Echague</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, after conducting a qualitative examination
on the five sticks of suspected marijuana cigarettes gave positive report to
the test for marijuana, a prohibited drug." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 16)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused-appellant vigorously insists in his
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asserts that the arresting
officers did not confiscate sticks of marijuana or any marked money from him; that
exhibits "A" (ten peso bill; "A-1" (serial number of the
money):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"A-2" (initial of the
witness above the serial number); "B" (the first pack which is fully
opened); "B-1" to "B-5" (another pack confiscated from the
suspect); "D" (certificate of Field Testing); "D-1"
(signature of Maj. Geary <span class="SpellE">Barias</span>; "E"
(laboratory result); "E-1" (qualitative result of the laboratory
test); and "E-2" (signature of Capt. Rubio) should have not been
admitted by the trial court since there was no confiscation receipt shown; that
the admission of exhibits "A" - "A-2," "B" <span style="">TO </span>"B-5" and "C,"
was erroneous because the same were taken during custodial investigation and
therefore, <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the constitution; and that
exhibit "A" should have been rejected because its serial number was
neither alleged nor mentioned in the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 26-29)</p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant completely misses the whole point of his prosecution
and ultimate conviction under RA 6425.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was caught <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">flagrante</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> </span>selling marijuana cigarettes to a
poseur-buyer in exchange for money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
commission of the offense of illegal sale of marijuana requires merely the
consummation of the selling transaction (People v. <span class="SpellE">Macuto</span>,
G.R. No. 80112, August 25, 1989, 176 SCRA 762).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The serial number of the marked money need not even be stated in the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case, <span class="GramE">We</span> held that the non-presentation of the marked money at the
trial is not indispensable to the conviction of the accused-appellant (see
People v. <span class="SpellE">Recedas</span>, G.R. No. 83372, <st1:date year="1991" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1991</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is important is the fact that the
poseur-buyer received the marijuana from the appellant and that the said
cigarettes were presented in court as evidence (see <span class="SpellE">Macuto</span>
case, <u><span style="">ibid)</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Having
been caught in the act of selling a prohibited drug, appellant's arrest was
lawful under Rule 113 of the Rules of Court, Section 5(a), thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marked money and the marijuana cigarettes
were immediately seized by the arresting officers contrary to appellant's
allegation that the same were taken during the custodial investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there was a receipt of the property
seized from the accused-appellant signed by the arresting officers and a copy
thereof was furnished him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">warrantless</span> search being an incident to a lawful arrest is
in itself lawful (People v. Claudio, G.R. No. 72564, April 15, 1988, <span style="">160 </span>SCRA 646).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, whatever is found in the accused­-appellant's
possession or in his control may be seized and used in evidence against him
(see <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, 76
Phil. 637).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the seized items,
the NARCOM officer, in a clear and categorical manner, testified to the
circumstances of the appellant's entrapment and arrest which was corroborated
by the testimony of his companion officer, to wit:</p>

inspected the contents which suspect Bong gave to him and indeed it was
marijuana cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> gave us the pre-arranged signal to the members of

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
gave us his true name as Antonio Enrique, sir." (<u>ibid</u>, pp. 11-13)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There was no showing that the arresting
officers knew the accused-appellant before his arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was likewise no evidence of any
ill-motive which would have impelled these officers to accuse the appellant of
the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the Other hand, the
entrapment and arrest of the appellant were done at Valdez Restaurant at past <st1:time hour="14" minute="0">two o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, there must have been
eyewitnesses to the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, <span class="GramE">appellant has not presented anyone who could have bolstered his
defense that he is not the owner of the contraband items</span> and that the
charges against him are fabricated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the absence of any <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> evidence, the
testimonies of these officers are given full faith and credence as they are
presumed to be in the regular performance of their official duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note however that, during the investigation, the
accused-appellant, unassisted by counsel, wrote his name on the rolled
marijuana cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Quebalayan</span> testified that the accused affixed his name
thereon voluntarily and that this gesture was intended as a security against
substitution (TSN, July 6, 1989, p. 24).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, he and the other arresting officers exerted no efforts to inform
the accused-appellant of his rights under custodial investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, appellant's act amounted to an
admission of his culpability in violation of the constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such admission is therefore inadmissible as
evidence (see People v. Peralta, G.R. No. 86172, <st1:date month="3" day="4" year="1991">March 4, 1991</st1:date> and People v. <span class="SpellE">delas</span>
<st1:city><st1:place>Marinas</st1:place></st1:city>, G.R. No. 87215, <st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1991">April 30, 1991</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding this setback for the
prosecution, appellant cannot be acquitted because his conviction did not rest
solely on his admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has
completely failed to rebut by contrary evidence the testimonies and documentary
evidence presented by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant then complains about the delayed laboratory examination
on the alleged marijuana cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
contends that the actual chemical examination was made on <st1:date month="7" day="7" year="1989">July 7, 1989</st1:date> when the alleged confiscation of
the contraband items took place on <st1:date month="5" day="9" year="1988">May
 9, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He voices out his
apprehension about the possibility of substitution as the marijuana cigarettes
brought to the chemist of the PC Narcotics Command were placed in a brown
envelop and only stapled (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 32-33).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the marijuana cigarettes were brought to the
laboratory of the P.C. Narcotics Command at <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>
for examination much later from the time of its confiscation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, an immediate field testing was
conducted by Major <span class="SpellE">Barias</span> on the cigarettes (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D, Records, p. 5), as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Did you investigate that pusher in your
office?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes</span>, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We arrested him and brought (sic) to my office
on May 9, 1988, and investigated or conducted (sic) but we released the suspect
after the initial investigation, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style=""> <span style=""> </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>And was there any specimen submitted to
you as a result of the arrest?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. <span style=""> </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>And what did you do with <span class="GramE">those specimen</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These</span> specimen which consist of dried
marijuana leaves and (sic) I conduct (sic) a field testing in my office to make
sure that this evidence was in deed a marijuana and the result the field
testing wherein I used NARCOTEST DISPOSAKIT 9 and it indicated that the liquid
inside turned red which is an indication that the specimen is indeed a
marijuana, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q.
<span style=""> </span></span>By the way, you said marijuana did
you have to go (sic) under gone any training?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes</span>, sir I under went training and
this was one of the subject that we had during the said training.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q. <span style=""> </span>And in the specimen that you said you tested, please describe to
this Honorable Court?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes</span>, sir from a marijuana sticks that
was (sic) presented to me. These dried leaves that I did only some and I placed
inside the <span class="SpellE">disposakit</span> and which we acted (sic) inside
and it proved that <span class="GramE">these</span> specimen is indeed a
marijuana, sir." (TSN, July, 19, 1989, pp. 44-46)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This kind of test is judicially
admissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have held that a chemical
analysis is not an indispensable <span class="SpellE">prerequirement</span> to
establish whether a certain substance offered in evidence is a prohibited drug
or not and that the ability to recognize these drugs can be acquired without a
knowledge of chemistry to such an extent that the testimony of a witness on the
point may be entitled to great weight (United States v. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liongco</span>, 33 Phil. 54).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the positive result of the
test and the marked money, the arresting officers filed a summary of the
information at the Municipal Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, on May 19, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Thereafter, the Biochemist of the PC Crime Laboratory,
Regional Unit 2 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> E, p. 82) confirmed the
presence of marijuana in the confiscated cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, appellant's other fear that the
cigarettes taken from him may have been changed just because these cigarettes
were belatedly brought to the chemist in a brown mailing envelope duly stapled
cannot be entertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This envelope was
not carelessly entrusted to anyone but a courier from the Narcotics Command
headed by Major <span class="SpellE">Barias</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, appellant's apprehension was not
accompanied by any substantial and strong evidence to convince <span class="GramE">Us</span> of the possibility of foul play in transporting the
package to the P.C. Crime Laboratory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, appellant impugns the non-presentation of the NARCOM
informer at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that he
was denied the opportunity to cross examine the alleged informer and that he
concludes that such failure to present the informer as a witness is proof of
the prosecution's weak evidence (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 35).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention is unmeritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no need to present the testimony of
the NARCOM informer as the same would merely be corroborative and
cumulative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. Sanchez (G.R.
No. 77588, May 12, 1989, 173 SCRA 305, 313), <span class="GramE">We</span>
declared that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
testimony of the police informer was similarly not essential for conviction of
the accused, his identity may remain confidential:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there are strong practical reasons for such
continued secrecy, including the continued health and safety of the informer
and the encouragement of others to report wrong doing to the police
authorities. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold
that the trial court did not err in convicting the accused?appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on record has fully established
his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the trial court imposed upon the accused-appellant the penalty
of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and a fine of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Section 4 of RA 6425 as amended by PD No. 1675, the penalty for the sale,
administration, delivery, distribution and transportation of prohibited drugs
is life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from twenty thousand to thirty
thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conformably with law,
the penalty that should be imposed for the crime committed by the accused-appellant
should instead be life imprisonment and a fine in the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED
subject to the modification as above?indicated.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
