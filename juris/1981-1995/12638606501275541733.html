dated 17 February 1977 of the NSB hearing officer which adjudged petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> liable to private respondent for violation of the

 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
and while under charter by <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>, the vessel's

(12) months with a monthly wage of US$500.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This agreement was executed before the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Area Manning Unit of the NSB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Shortly after returning to the Philippines, private respondent
filed a complaint before public respondent NSB, which complaint was docketed as
<span class="GramE">NSB-1331-77, for violation of contract, against Mullion as
the shipping company and petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> as agent
of the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> and of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
of the vessel.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the initial hearing, the NSB hearing officer held a conference
with the parties, at which conference petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>
was represented by one of its <span class="SpellE">supercargos</span>, Edmond
Cruz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Edmond Cruz asked, in writing,
that the hearing be postponed for a month upon the ground that the employee of <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> in charge of the case was out of town.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hearing officer denied this request and
then declared petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> in default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, private respondent testified
that when he was recruited by the Captain of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dufton</u></span><u>
Bay</u>, the latter was accompanied to the NSB <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
Area Manning Unit by two (2) <span class="SpellE">supercargos</span> sent by
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
and that the two (2) <span class="SpellE">supercargos</span> Edmond Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> assisted private
respondent in the procurement of his National Investigation and Security Agency
(NISA) clearance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Messrs. Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> were also present during private respondent's
interview by Captain Ho King <span class="SpellE">Yiu</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u>Dufton</u></span></st1:placename><u> </u><st1:placetype><u>Bay</u></st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="2">17 February 1977</st1:date>,

the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which read:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
ordering the respondents R.D. Mullion Shipbrokers Co., Ltd., and <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> Shipping Co., Inc., jointly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> to pay the complainant the sum of four thousand
six hundred fifty seven dollars and sixty three cents ($4,657.63) or its
equivalent in the Phil. currency within 10 days from receipt of the copy of
this Decision the payment of which to be coursed through the then NSB."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above conclusion was rationalized in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence on record it clearly appears that there was
no sufficient or valid cause for the respondents to terminate the services of
complainant prior to <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="9">17 September 1977</st1:date>,
which is the expiry date of the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason the respondents have violated the conditions of the
contract of employment which is a sufficient justification for this Board to
render award in favor of the complainant of the unpaid salaries due the latter
as damages corresponding to the unexpired portion of the contract including the
accrued leave pay computed on the basis of five (5) days pay for every month of
service based at $500.00 monthly salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant's wages account further show that he has an <span class="SpellE">undrawn</span> wage amounting to US$13.19 to be paid by the
respondents Philippine agency together with his accrued leave pay."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> filed a motion for
reconsideration of the hearing officer's decision; the motion was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner next filed an "Appeal and/or
Motion for Reconsideration of the Default Judgment dated <st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="8">9 August 1977</st1:date>" with the central office of the
NSB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>NSB then suspended its hearing
officer's decision and lifted the order of default against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>, thereby allowing the latter to adduce evidence in
its own behalf.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NSB hearing officer, on <st1:date year="1978" day="26" month="4">26 April 1978</st1:date>, made the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"While it appears that in the preparation of the employment
papers of the complainant, what was indicated therein was R.D. Mullion Co. (HK)
Ltd. referring to Exhibit "B" (Standard Format of a Service
Agreement) and Exhibit "C" (Affidavit of Undertaking), as the company
whom Captain Ho King <span class="SpellE">Yiu</span>, the Master of the vessel <span class="SpellE">Dufton</span> Bay, was representing to be the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>,
the fact remains that at the time of the recruitment of the complainant, as
duly verified by the National Seamen Board, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Area
Manning Unit, the <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> Shipping Company was the
authorized agent of the vessel's <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> Shipping Corporation, and that in the recruitment
process, the <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> Shipping Company through its <span class="SpellE">supercargos</span> in the persons of Edmund Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>, had knowledge
thereof and in fact assisted in the interviews conducted by the Master of the
crew applicants as admitted by <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> including the acts of facilitating the crew's NISA
clearances as testified to by complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the participation of the <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> Shipping
Corporation in the recruitment of complainant, together with the other
crewmembers, in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in September 1976 can be traced
to the contents of the letter of April 5, 1976 by the <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>
Shipping Limited, thru its Director David H.L. Wu addressed to the National
Seamen Board, copy of which is on file with Contracts and Licensing Division,

<p class="BODY">The NSB then lifted the suspension of the hearing officer's <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="2">17 February 1977</st1:date> decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> once more moved for
reconsider­ation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="5">31 May 1979</st1:date>, public respondent NSB

which affirmed its hearing officer's decision of <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="2">17 February 1977</st1:date> and which read in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It is clear that <u>respondent <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>

disembarkation on <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also clear from the complainant's wages
account bearing the heading '<span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> Shipping
Corporation', signed by the Master of the vessel that <u>the Philippine agency
referred to herein directed to pay the said withdrawn wages</u> of $13.19 <u>is

that <span class="SpellE"><u>Fairwind</u></span><u> Shipping Corporation is the
employer of said complainant</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it had been established by complainant that <span class="SpellE"><u>Litonjua</u></span><u> Shipping Company, Inc., had knowledge of

the provisions of Art 4 thereof, that 'all doubts in the implementation and
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, including its implementing rules
and regulations, shall be resolved in favor of labor', it is our conclusion,
that the decision dated February 17, 1977, is based on evidence formally
offered and presented during the hearing and that <u>there was no grave abuse
of discretion committed by the hearing officer in finding respondent <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> Shipping Company, Inc., liable to complainant</u>."
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> assails the decision of public respondent NSB
declaring the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>
as employer of private respondent, and for whose liability petitioner was made
responsible, as constituting a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The principal if not the
sole issue to be resolved here is whether or not the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> was properly regarded as the employer of
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Candongo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> makes two (2)
principal submissions in support of its contention, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a general rule,
admiralty law as embodied in the Philippine Code of Commerce fastens liability
for payment of the crew's wages upon the ship owner, and not the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The</span>
evidence of record is grossly inadequate to shift such liability from the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> to the petitioner."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> contends that the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>, <u>not</u> the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>,
was the <span class="GramE">employer</span> of private respondent; and that
liability for damages cannot be imposed upon petitioner which was a mere agent
of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is insisted that private respondent's contract of employment and
affidavit of undertaking clearly showed that the party with whom he had
contracted was none other than Mullion, the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>,
represented by the ship's master.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner also argues that its <span class="SpellE">supercargos</span> merely
assisted Captain Ho King <span class="SpellE">Yiu</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u>Dufton</u></span></st1:placename><u> </u><st1:placetype><u>Bay</u></st1:placetype></st1:place>
in hiring private respondent as Third Engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner also points to the circumstance that the discharge and the
repatriation of private respondent <span class="GramE">was</span> specified in
his Seaman's Book as having been "by owner's arrange." Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> thus argues that being the agent of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> and not of the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>,
it accordingly should not have been held liable on the contract of employment
of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded by petitioner's argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We believe that there are two (2) grounds
upon which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> may be held liable to
the private respondent on the contract of employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first basis is the charter party which existed between
Mullion, the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In modern maritime law and usage, there are three (3) distinguishable
types of charter parties:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the
"bareboat" or "demise" charter; (b) the "time"
charter; and (c) the "voyage" or "trip" charter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A bareboat or demise charter is a demise of a
vessel, much as a lease of an unfurnished house is a demise of real property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> turns
over possession of his vessel to the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>, who
then undertakes to provide a crew and victuals and supplies and fuel for her
during the term of the charter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> is not normally required by the terms of a demise
charter to provide a crew, and so the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> gets
the "bare boat", i.e., without a crew.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Sometimes, of course, the demise charter might provide that the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> is to furnish a master and crew to man the vessel
<u>under the <span class="SpellE">charterer's</span> direction</u>, such that the
master and crew provided by the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> become the
agents and servants or employees of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>,
and the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> (and not the owner) through the
agency of the master, has possession and control of the vessel during the
charter period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A time charter, upon the
other hand, like a demise charter, is a contract for the use of a vessel for a
specified period of time or for the duration of one or more specified
voyages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, the
owner of a time-chartered vessel (unlike the owner of a vessel under a demise
or bare-boat charter), retains possession and control through the master and
crew who remain his employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the
time <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> acquires is the right to utilize the
carrying capacity and facilities of the vessel and to designate her
destinations during the term of the charter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A voyage charter, or trip charter, is simply a contract of <span class="SpellE">affreightment</span>, that is, a contract for the carriage of
goods, from one or more ports of loading to one or more ports of unloading, on
one or on a series of voyages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a
voyage charter, master and crew remain in the employ of the owner of the
vessel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is well settled that in a demise or bare boat charter, the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is treated as owner <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>hac</u></span> <u>vice</u> of the vessel, the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> assuming in large measure the customary rights
and liabilities of the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> in relation to third
persons who have dealt with him or with the vessel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

In such case, the Master of the vessel is the agent of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
and not of the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> or owner <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>hac</u></span>
<u>vice</u>, and <u>not</u> the general owner of the vessel, is held liable for
the expenses of the voyage including the wages of the seamen.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is important to note that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>
did not place into the record of this case a copy of the charter party covering
the M/V <span class="SpellE"><u>Dufton</u></span><u> Bay</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We must assume that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> was aware of the nature of a bareboat or demise
charter and that if petitioner did not see fit to include in the record a copy
of the charter party, which had been entered into by its principal, it was
because the charter party and the provisions thereof were not supportive of the
position adopted by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> in the
present case, a position diametrically opposed to the legal consequence of a
bareboat charter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Treating <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> as owner <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>hac</u></span> <u>vice</u>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>
having failed to show that it was not such, we believe and so hold that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>, as Philippine agent of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>, may be held liable on the contract of employment
between the ship captain and the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a second and ethically more compelling basis for holding
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> liable on the contract of
employment of private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> of the vessel, <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>,
clearly <span class="SpellE">benefitted</span> from the employment of private
respondent as Third Engineer of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dufton</u></span><u>
Bay</u>, along with the ten (10) other Filipino crewmembers recruited by
Captain Ho in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> at the same occasion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
If private respondent had not agreed to serve as such Third Engineer, the ship
would not have been able to proceed with its voyage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The equitable consequence of this benefit to
the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>, is moreover, reinforced by convergence
of other circumstances of which the Court must take account.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is the circumstance that only the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>, through the petitioner, was present in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the scope of authority or the
responsibility of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> was not clearly
delimited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner as <span class="GramE">noted,</span> took the position that its commission was limited to
taking care of vessels owned by <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the documentary authorization read into
the record of this case does not make that clear at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The words - "our ships" may well be
read to refer <u>both</u> to vessels registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> and vessels owned by others but chartered by <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed the
commercial, operating requirements of a vessel for crew members and for
supplies and provisions have no relationship to the technical character­ization
of the vessel as owned by or as merely chartered by <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any case, it is not clear from the authori­zation
given by <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>
that vessels chartered by <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> (and owned by some
other companies) were <u>not</u> to be taken care of by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> should such vessels put into a Philippine
port.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statement of account which the
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><u>Dufton</u></span></st1:placename><u>
 </u><st1:placetype><u>Bay</u></st1:placetype></st1:place><u>'s</u> Master had
signed and which pertained to the salary of private respondent had referred to
a Philippine agency which would take care of disbursing or paying such
account.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that that,
Philippine agency was the Philippine agent of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, there is also no question that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>
did assist the Master of the vessel in locating and recruiting private
respondent as Third Engineer of the vessel as well as ten (10) other Filipino
seamen as crew members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In so doing,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> certainly in effect represented
that it was taking care of the crewing and other requirements of a vessel
chartered by its principal, <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Last, but certainly not least, there is the circumstance that
extreme hardship would result for the private respondent if petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>, as Philippine agent of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>,
is not held liable to private respondent upon the contract of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the private respondent, and the
other Filipino crew members of the vessel, would be defenseless against a
breach of their respective contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While wages of crew members constitute a maritime lien upon the vessel,
private respondent is in no position to enforce that lien, if only because the
vessel, being one of foreign registry and not ordinarily doing business in the
Philippines or making regular calls on Philippine ports cannot be effectively
held to answer for such claims in a Philippine forum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, it seems quite clear
that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>, should it be held liable to
private respondent for the latter's claims, would be better placed to secure
reimbursement from its principal <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In turn, <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>
would be in an infinitely better position (than private respondent) to seek and
obtain recourse from Mullion, the foreign <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>,
should <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> feel entitled to reimbursement of the
amounts paid to private respondent through petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude that private respondent was properly regarded as an
employee of the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>
and that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> may be held to answer to
private respondent for the latter's claims as the agent in the Philippines of <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We think
this result, which public respondent reached, far from constituting a grave
abuse of discretion, is compelled by equitable principles and by the demands of
substantial justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To hold otherwise
would be to leave private respondent (and others who may find themselves in his
position) without any effective recourse for the unjust dismissal and for the
breach of his contract of employment.</p>

A standard text sets forth the following explanation:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">"Concerning liability to third
parties, a basic distinction is whether the charter is a demise or bareboat
charter, on the one hand, or a time or voyage charter, on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vital distinction between <span class="GramE">a demise</span> and other charter parties is whether the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is given the exclusive control of the
vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a demise, in contrast to
other charters, the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is considered the owner
<u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>hac</u></span> <u>vice</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is
accordingly liable <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span> for all
liabilities arising out of the operation of the vessel; he is responsible for
the actions of the master and crew.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> is generally not liable <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>, although the ship may be liable <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even in
this case, the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is obliged to indemnify the
owner against liability suffered by the vessel as a consequence of the <span class="SpellE">charterer's</span> negligence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> may be liable, however, where
liability or injury results from <span class="SpellE">unseaworthiness</span> or
negligence which existed prior to delivery of the vessel to the demise <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>." (<span class="SpellE">Schoenbaum</span>,

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">"1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the vessel '<span class="SpellE">Dufton</span>
Bay', reached port in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> sometime in 1976, <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> Shipping Company sent and assigned its employee,
Edmund Cruz, to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> as its supercargo to supervise
the servicing and loading operation of the vessel; <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> of the same company was also sent to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to assist Edmund Cruz;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the need of the Master of the
vessel to hire new crew members, Edmund Cruz accompanied him to the Officer-in-Charge
of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Area Manning Unit of the National Seamen
Board, for the purpose;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the recruitment process, <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span> Shipping Co., Inc., through its super cargo,
Edmund Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>,
had knowledge thereof and in fact were present in the hotel where the
applicants were interviewed by the Master of the vessel; both parties performed
their duties as super cargo only for one day, but stayed in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
for 15 days; and it was Mr. Cruz who gave the complainant the forms for his
NISA clearance and his seamen's continuous discharge book (SCDB);</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The participation of <span class="SpellE">Litonjua</span>
Shipping Company, Inc., through its employees, can be traced from the fact that
said company is the duty appointed local crewing manning officer of <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> Shipping Corporation with powers to act as the
latter's local representative who can sue and be sued and to bind and sign
contracts for and in behalf of said <span class="SpellE">Fairwind</span> Shipping
Corporation." (<span class="SpellE"><i>Rollo</i></span>, p. 51)</p>
