				<H3>THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. OSMUNDO
M. VILLANUEVA, JUDGE, MCTC, BAGUMBAYAN-ESPERANZA, SULTAN KUDARAT, AND HEIDE B.
PACACO, CLERK OF COURT, MCTC, BAGUMBAYAN-ESPERANZA, SULTAN KUDARAT, RESPONDENTS.

				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On September 10, 1990, a complaint for gross immorality was filed
by the Office of the Court Administrator against herein respondents, allegedly
committed and preliminarily investigated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>On June 7, 1990, the office of the undersigned received an unsworn
letter-complaint from (a) concerned citizen of Sultan Kudarat explicitly
alleging therein that the respondent judge has a "querida" by the
name of Heide B. Pacaco, his Clerk of Court; that the respondent judge has an
illegitimate child with her named Caesar Anthony P. Villanueva who is 4 years
old.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On June 19, 1990, the undersigned directed Judge German Malcampo,
RTC, Branch 19, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat to conduct a discreet investigation and
report on the matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In an indorsement dated July 24, 1990, the aforecited Judge
Malcampo confirmed substantially the truth of the allegations in the
letter-complaint of the said concerned citizen.  He further stated that the information on the personal
circumstances of Caesar Anthony P. Villanueva was obtained from Montessori
Learning Center, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat where the latter is enrolled.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated September 18, 1990, this Court required
respondents to comment thereon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In separate answers,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
respondents vehemently denied the charges against them and presented a
certification issued by Mrs. Tessie la Torre, Directress of the Montessori
Learning Center at Isulan, Sultan Kudarat, stating that Caesar Anthony P.
Villanueva is the son of Oscar M. Villanueva and Helen B. Paciente.  Both prayed for the dismissal of the
complaint against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution dated December 11, 1990, this Court referred
the case to Judge German M. Malcampo, Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Isulan,
Sultan Kudarat for investigation, report and recommendation within ninety (90)
days from receipt of the records.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A joint motion for inhibition, dated March 7, 1991, was filed by
respondents which sought to inhibit Judge Malcampo because of the initial
investigation he had made on the case, and prayed for the designation of
another investigating judge.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, we issued a resolution on May 30, 1991, granting the motion to
inhibit and designating Judge Romeo S. Sucaldito, RTC, Branch 20, Tacurong,
Sultan Kudarat in lieu of Judge Malcampo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Three persons testified as witnesses for the complainant, namely,
Mila Villaflores, Gemma Panagdato and Belen Lopez.  Respondent Judge Osmundo M. Villanueva testified in his behalf
and also presented Arcadio Ramos, Chief Documents Examiner of the National
Bureau of Investigation.  Respondent
Heide B. Pacaco likewise testified and adopted the testimonies of Judge
Villanueva, Mila Villaflores and Emma Panagdato as part of her evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 17, 1991, respondent Judge Villanueva filed his memorandum
and alleged that the authenticity of the only evidence submitted by the
complainant, which is the Certificate of Live Birth of Ceasar Anthony P.
Villanueva, marked in evidence as Exhibit "D", is doubtful because
Belen Lopez, who identified Exhibit "D" does not know who actually
prepared it; she could not remember the person who signed thereon; the
certificate was never subscribed before her nor was it completely filled up; it
contains alterations which were never explained; and it has been proven that
respondent Villanueva's supposed signature thereon is not his signature.  He further contended that the birth
certificate is inadmissible to prove filiation, especially if the alleged
illegitimate father did not sign the said birth certificate under oath; that
his alleged signature appearing in the birth certificate is falsified; and that
no other evidence was presented to show that he is guilty of immorality.  He, therefore, prays for the dismissal of
the complaint against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Pacaco, in her memorandum, likewise questions the
authenticity and probative value of Exhibit "D" based on
substantially the same grounds invoked by respondent Villanueva.  She denies that the signature appearing on
the birth certificate is her signature.  In addition, she claims that while it is true that there is a
presumption of regularity in the execution of a public document, such
presumption has been overcome in this case by reason of the irregularities
which attended the preparation of the birth certificate of Ceasar Anthony P.
Villanueva, plus the fact that the alleged signatures of respondents were
forged.  Furthermore, respondent Pacaco
explained that the child Ceasar Anthony was merely left in her care by her
second cousin who is presently abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">The commendable Report and Recommendation thereafter submitted by
Judge Romeo S. Sucaldito, dated March 4, 1993, made the following extensive
findings and ratiocinative conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mila Villaflores is the Principal of
Montessori Learning Center in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat.  As principal, she personally knows Caesar Anthony P. Villanueva
who is one of their pupils.  Mrs.
Villaflores has not personally met the parents of Caesar Anthony.  His enrollment form however states that his
parents are Helen B. Paciente and Oscar M. Villanueva.  Mrs. Villaflores does not know whether
Caesar Anthony's parents are still alive.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In obedience to the subpoena issued, Mrs. Villaflores brought the
enrollment form (Exh. "A"), birth certificate (Exh "B") and
the pre-elementary progress report card or Form 138 of Caesar Anthony (Exh.
"C") when she testified.  She
can not recall who prepared Exhibit "A" because of the number of
enrollees at that time.  Exhibit
"B" is only a machine copy.  At Montessori, they do not require the submission of the original copy
of the birth certificates of their pupils.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Miss Gemma Panagdato is a teacher at
Montessori in Isulan.  She handled the
nursery class during the school year 1990-1991.  One of her pupils during that year was Caesar Anthony P.
Villanueva.  Caesar Anthony resides at
No. 1 Juan Street, Kalawag, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat.  He lives with respondent Heide Pacaco, who is the neighbor of
Gemma Panagdato.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Miss Panagdato does not know Helen B. Paciente, the alleged mother
of Caesar Anthony.  She has never seen
Helen B. Paciente.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Belen P. Lopez is the City Department
Head of the Local Civil Registry of General Santos.  One of her duties is to register births, marriages and deaths
that occurred in General Santos City.  Complying with the subpoena duces tecum issued to her, Mrs. Lopez
brought the certificate of live birth of Caesar Anthony Pacaco Villanueva
bearing Registry No. 86-05846 and a certified machine copy thereof (Exh.
"D") when she testified.  Both
the original and the machine copy of the birth certificates bear her
signatures.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As shown by the birth certificate and Exhibit "D", Caesar
Anthony Pacaco Villanueva appears to have been born on September 15, 1986 (Exh.
"D-3") at General S. District Hospital in General Santos City.  The name "Haide Pacaco" appears as
his mother.  His father is mentioned
therein as "Osmundo Villanueva." The informant of birth is
"Haide P. Villanueva" whose "relationship to child" is
stated therein as "mother." There is a signature above the
typewritten name "Haide P. Villanueva," informant, which clearly
reads "hbpacaco" (Exh. "D-4").  The same is written in green ink in the original copy of the
certificate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the back of Exhibit "D" are entries written in green
ink under the title "Affidavit of Acknowledgment" (Exh.
"D-5").  The ink used in
writing these entries is the same or similar to the ink used in writing the
signature "hbpacaco" in Exh. "D-4." The names "Osmundo
M. Villanueva and "Heide B. Pacaco" are written therein as father and
mother, respectively.  In the space for
the signature of father is an illegible signature which is also written in
green ink.  The signature in the space
for the signature of mother is also written in green ink and the same clearly
reads '"hbpacaco."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The birth of Ceasar Anthony Pacaco Villanueva was registered on
October 2, 1986.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mrs. Belen Lopez also brought with her the certificate of live
birth of Caesar<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a>
Anthony Paciente Villanueva when she testified.  During her testimony, the said certificate was compared with the
certified machine copy thereof (Exh. "E") that she also
admitted.  Exh. "E" is a
faithful copy of the original certificate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The original certificate shows that Caesar Anthony Paciente
Villanueva was born on September 13, 1985 at San Roque, Makar, General Santos
City.  His parents are named therein as
"Oscar Mallari Villanueva" and "Helen Bibet Paciente." The
informant is "Helen Bibet Paciente" who is mentioned therein as his
mother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The birth of Caesar Anthony Paciente Villanueva was registered in the
Local Civil Register of General Santos City on January 9, 1991 under the late
registration system.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge Osmundo M. Villanueva denied
having an illicit relationship with his co­-respondent Heide Pacaco.  He also denied having a child with her.  He testified that his relation­ship with her
is merely that of a superior to a subordinate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Villanueva
denied authorship of the signature above the printed word "Signature of
Father" in the Affidavit of Acknowledgment (Exh. "D-5") of Exh.
"D".  He alleged that the said
signature is a forgery.  He testified
that he came to know of said signature after Exhibit "D" was marked
in evidence during the hearing.  After
he learned about it, he immediately wrote a letter to Mrs. Belen P. Lopez, the
Local Civil Registrar of General Santos City (Exh. "1-Villanueva" and
Exh. "1-A-Villanueva").  He
informed Mrs. Lopez that his alleged signature in Exh. "D-5" is a
forgery.  He also informed Mrs. Lopez of
his intention to have the said signature examined by (a) handwriting expert of
the National Bureau of Investigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>During his testimony, respondent Judge admitted that he is familiar
with the signature of his co-respondent Heide Pacaco because the latter has
been his Clerk of Court for about ten years.  He was shown Exh. "D-4", which is the signature
"hbpacaco" above the typewritten words "Heide P.
Villanueva," "Mother".  He was asked whether the same is the signature of Heide Pacaco.  Judge Villanueva answered:  "It looks like her signature, Your
Honor." (tsn, pp. 11 to 12, hearing of June 18, 1991).  Judge Villanueva also testified that the
signature above the printed words "Signature of Mother" in Exhibit
"D-5" "seems to be that of the Clerk of Court, Heide
Pacaco.  (tsn., page 13, hearing of June
18, 1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>He further testified that he had confronted Heide Pacaco about Exh.
"D".  When he asked her why
she placed the surname Villanueva as the surname of Ceasar Anthony, respondent
Pacaco answered:  "You are not the
only Villanueva in the world." (tsn, page 12, hearing of June 18, 1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Villanueva also asked Heide Pacaco why she appears to have
given birth to a child named Ceasar Anthony as shown by Exh. "D" but
Pacaco was evasive and "antagonistic." She could not answer Judge
Villanueva whether Ceasar Anthony is her son or not.  She did not deny or admit that Ceasar Anthony is her son.  (tsn, pp. 14 to 16, hearing of June 18,
1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Before this case was filed, Judge Villanueva had seen Ceasar
Anthony in the company of Heide Pacaco.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Villanueva does not know why he was charged.  He, however, attributed the filing of this
case to disgruntled litigants who lost their cases in his court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondent Heide Pacaco is still single and
resides at Kalawag I, Isulan, Sultan Kudarat.  She has been the Clerk of Court of the 4th Municipal Circuit Trial Court
of Bagumbayan?Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, for about twelve years.  Before she became a Clerk of Court, she was
the stenographer of the Municipal Trial Court of Isulan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Heide Pacaco denied having an illicit relationship with
Judge Villanueva.  She also denied
having a child with him.  She explained
that Ceasar Anthony Villanueva, who lives with her, is actually the son of her
second cousin, Helen Paciente and her husband Oscar Villanueva.  Helen Paciente works in Saudi Arabia.  She and her husband are separated.  Their separation took place before she went
to Saudi Arabia.  Before she left, Helen
entrusted Ceasar Anthony to Heide Pacaco.  Ceasar Anthony was only one year old when he was entrusted to Miss
Pacaco.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The whereabouts of the alleged father Oscar Villanueva is not
known.  Heide Pacaco does not know where
he is.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Helen Paciente allegedly went home on vacation in December,
1990.  Upon her arrival, she was asked
by Heide Pacaco about the birth certificate of Ceasar Anthony.  She could not produce any because the birth
of Ceasar Anthony was not registered, Heide then told Helen to register his
birth.  Following Heide's advice, Helen
registered Ceasar Anthony's birth in the Civil Register of General Santos City
on January 9, 1991.  A certificate of
live birth was thereafter issued (Exh. "E", Exh.
"2-Villanueva" and Exhibit "1-Pacaco").</blockquote>

<blockquote>Heide Pacaco inquired about Ceasar Anthony's birth certificate
because of the misconception of many people that the latter is her son.  Moreover, at that time she had already
learned of the charge against her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>During her testimony, Heide Pacaco was asked whether the signature
(Exh. "D-4") above the typewritten name "Heide P.
Villanueva," "Mother" is hers.  She denied authorship of the same.  She was further asked whether the signature above the printed words
"Signature of Mother" in Exh. "D-1" belongs to her.  She likewise denied it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Pacaco admitted that she was confronted by Judge
Villanueva about the Certificate of Live Birth of Ceasar Anthony and that she
evaded answering him.  She however
explained that her antagonism and outburst at Judge Villanueva was due to her
state of mind at that time.  She was
then confused and bothered of (sic) the charge.  She further admitted that she had answered Judge Villanueva that
he is not the only Villanueva in the world when asked about Exhibit
"D".  She explained that she
had inso­lently answered him because she was irritable at that time (tsn., pp.
8 and 9, hearing of August 26, 1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Pacaco contends that the complaint against her and Judge
Villanueva is meant to destroy the latter because of some decisions that he had
rendered.  She had observed that some
litigants are not contented with his decisions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arcadio A. Ramos is the Chief Documents
Examiner of the National Bureau of Investigation.  He has been with the NBI since 1961, starting as interrogator of
the complaint section, moving to the interrogation unit of the clearance
section in 1963, to the questioned documents division in 1965, and then as a
document examiner in 1966.  He was
promoted senior document examiner in 1972 and as supervising document examiner
in 1979.  He became the
Officer-In-Charge of the division in 1979 and held that position until 1988.  Finally in 1989, he was appointed Chief
Documents Examiner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Ramos has attended several seminars conducted by the NBI
Academy on questioned documents.  He was
sent to Hongkong in 1981 on a grant from the British Government to broaden his
expertise on questioned documents.  He
is a member of (the) International Association for Identifi­cation and American
Academy of Forensic Sciences of which he is the only Filipino member.  He had examined thousands of questioned
documents and had testified in Court in thousands of cases involving questioned
documents.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In compliance with the order of October 9, 1991, which was issued
at the instance of Judge Villanueva, Mr. Ramos examined the questioned
signature in the Certificate of Live Birth of Ceasar Anthony Pacaco Villanueva
and the eight (8) standards or sample signature(s) of said respondent which are
marked Exhibits "4-Villanueva" to "11-Villanueva,"
inclusive.  The examination was made for
the purpose of determining whether the questioned signature and the standards
submitted were written by one and the same person.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exhibits "4-Villanueva" to Exhibit
"11-Villanueva" are signatures of Judge Villanueva on seven official
documents that he signed in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the 4th
Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Bagumbayan-Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat.  These signatures were affixed on dates
contemporaneous, or near the date of, the registration of the Certificate of
Live Birth of Ceasar Anthony Villanueva which is October 2, 1986.  These dates are September 24, 1986 (Exh.
"6"), October 2, 1986 (Exhs. "7" and "8"),
October 6, 1986 (Exh. "9") and October 9, 1986 (Exh. "10").</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exhibit "11-Villanueva" contains six (6) signatures of
Judge Villanueva which he affixed on August 22, 1991 during the hearing of this
case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Six other standards or samples of Judge Villanueva's signatures
were also examined by Mr. Ramos.  These
standards were earlier sent by Judge Villanueva to the NBI for examination on
his own accord.  These standards which
are marked Exhs. "14", "15", "16",
"17", "18" and "19", inclusive, appear to have
been affixed on October 2, 1986 (Exh. "14"), October 29, 1986 (Exh.
"15"), November 5, 1986 (Exh. "16"), December, 1986 (Exh. "17"),
July 20, 1991 (Exh. "18") and July 20, 1991 (Exh. "19"),
respectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Ramos examined the questioned signature and the standards or
samples submitted with the use of a stereoscopic microscope.  He took pictures of the questioned signature
and standards.  He had the photographs
developed and enlarged.  He prepared a
comparison chart (Exh. "13") wherein he attached the enlarged
photographs of the questioned signature (Exh. "13-A") and the
standards submitted upon order of the Court and those that Judge Villanueva
submitted.  (Exhs. "13-B" to
"13-U", inclusive).  Thereafter, Mr. Ramos made a comparison of the questioned signature and
sample signatures.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Ramos found significant differences in handwriting
characteristics between the questioned signature and the standards or sample
signatures.  The following are the
differences:  first, the questioned
signature has a very poor line quality, while the standards submitted have
smooth line quality; second, the initial stroke of the questioned signature
starts below the base line, while in the sample signatures the same starts from
either above or from the base line and that the said characteristic is
consistent in all the samples; third, the loops in the questioned signature,
especially the two (2) middle ones, are big and irregular, while in the sample
signatures the loops are regular and uniform; fourth, the upward stroke in the
questioned signature is shorter and perpendicular to the base line and it
abruptly ends downward with a loop, while in the standards submitted the same
curves towards the left; fifth, the loop of the terminal stroke in the
questioned signature is on the base line, while in the sample signatures the
same goes beyond the base line (tsn., pp. 8 to 10, hearing of November 8,
1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Ramos concluded that the questioned signature and the sample
signature(s) were not written by one and the same person.  He had prepared a report of his examination
and findings.  The report is captioned
Questioned Documents Report No. 590-991 and bears the date October 23, 1991
(Exhs. "12", "12-A" and "12-B").</blockquote>

<blockquote>Based on the evidence presented, the following are clearly
established:  that a child named Ceasar
Anthony P. Villanueva was enrolled in the nursery class of Montessori Learning
Center in Isulan, Sultan Kudarat during the school year 1990-1991; that said
child lives with respondent Heide Pacaco at No. 1 Juan Street, Kalawag I,
Isulan, Sulatan Kudarat; that said Ceasar Anthony P. Villanueva and Heide
Pacaco are the neighbors of Miss Gemma Panagdato, the teacher who handled the
nursery class of Montessori during the above-mentioned school year; and that
both Gemma Panagdato and Mila Villaflores, the principal of Montessori, have
not seen the parents of Ceasar Anthony P. Villanueva.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence also established the following:  that on October 2, 1986, the birth of Ceasar
Anthony Pacaco Villanueva was registered in the Local Civil Register of General
Santos City; that after the same was registered, a certificate of live birth
was issued; that in said birth certificate, the parents of Ceasar Anthony
appear to be "Haide Pacaco" and "Osmundo Villanueva"; that
as shown further in said certificate, the informant of the birth of Ceasar
Anthony is the mother "Haide P. Villanueva"; that the signature of
said informant reads "hbpacaco"; that Ceasar Anthony appears to have
been born on September 15, 1986 at General S. District Hospital in General
Santos City; that at the back of the birth certificate under the heading
Affidavit of Acknowledgment, there is another signature which reads
"hbpacaco" above the printed words "Signature of Mother";
that the signature of the informant and the signature above the printed words
"Signature of Mother" in the affidavit of acknowledgment are both
written in green ink and are strikingly similar to each other; and that the
color of the ink used in writing the signature above the printed words
"Signature of Father" is also green.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence further established the following:  that on January 9, 1991, the birth of one
Caesar Anthony Paciente Villanueva was registered in the Civil Register of
General Santos City; that a certificate of live birth under Register No.
91-0029 was issued; that as appearing in said birth certificate, the parents of
Caesar Anthony Paciente Villanueva are Helen Bibit Paciente and Oscar Mallari
Villanueva; that the informant appears to be "Helen Villanueva",
"Mother" and that said child appears to have been born on September
13, 1985 in San Rogue, Makar, General Santos City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All the evidence presented had been thoroughly analyzed.  But the undersigned found no direct evidence
that shows or tends to show that respondents have an illicit relationship.  No witness testified establishing said
relationship.  No letter, postcard, or
picture showing the existence of an illicit affair between the respondents has
been introduced in evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that Ceasar Anthony P. Villanueva exists in person has
been however established.  His existence
has been clearly established by the testimonies of Mrs. Mila Villaflores and
Miss Gemma Panagdato of Montessori Learning Center where the said child was
enrolled as a nursery pupil during the school year 1990-1991.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Villanueva and Heide Pacaco both testified about Ceasar
Anthony P. Villanueva.  Miss Pacaco even
admits that Ceasar Anthony lives with her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whose child is Ceasar Anthony P. Villanueva?   Who are his parents?  Is he the illegitimate son of the
respondents?  Again, no direct evidence
has been presented on this point.  The
only evidence that links the respondents to the said child is Exh.
"D", the certificate of live birth of Ceasar Anthony Pacaco
Villanueva which was issued by the Local Civil Registrar of General Santos
City.  As earlier stated, the said birth
certificate contains data that link respondents to the child.  It also contains signatures which
purportedly belong to the respondents.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondents attack Exh. "D" on the following
grounds:  that the same is a falsified
document; that it was not known who submitted it to the Local Civil Registrar
of General Santos City; that the Civil Registrar, Mrs. Belen Lopez, could not
recall whether respondent Heide Pacaco appeared and signed the same before her;
that the affidavit of acknowledgment was not subscribed and sworn as required;
and that it contains unexplained alterations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exhibit "D" is a public document.  To destroy it, a clear, convincing and
overwhelming evidence of falsity is needed.  It is well-settled that public documents executed with the solemnities
of law can not be set aside on light and flimsy evidence.  (Asido vs. Guzman, 37 Phil. 652; Mendoza vs.
Phil. Sugar Estates Development Co., 41 Phil. 475; El Hogar Filipino vs.
Olviga, 60 Phil. 17).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondents ha(ve) not presented sufficient evidence to render
Exh. "D" invalid in toto.  Assuming that some entries therein are false, the falsities of some do
not render the whole document invalid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In registration of births, it is not required that the Local Civil
Registrar must have personal knowledge of the person registering the
birth.  The fact that the one
registering the birth is not known to the registrar is of no consequence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondents vigorously hammer on the fact that Mrs. Belen
Lopez, the Local Civil Registrar of General Santos, could not recall whether
respondent Heide Pacaco has signed the certificate before her.  Mrs. Belen Lopez has fully explained her
inability to recall.  She attributed
this to the fact that there are about 1,000 births that they register
monthly.  Because of the volume, she can
not recall whether a particular informant, mother or father has appeared or
signed in her presence.  The explanation
of Mrs. Lopez is not without merit.  It
is logical, natural and in accord with the natural course of things.  Moreover, Mrs. Lopez had explained that
their manual allows hospitals, doctors, nurses and even trained
"hilots" to prepare the birth certificate based on the information
given by the informant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that the affidavit of acknowledgment was not sworn to can
not be faulted on the Local Civil Registrar.  Probably, the alleged father or mother did not appear before Mrs. Lopez.  It was probably for this reason that Mrs.
Lopez did not administer the oath as required.  But there is nothing illegal in her failure to subscribe the
acknowledgment.  What she did was proper
because it is illegal to subscribe and administer an oath to someone who has
not appeared before her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is no intentional alteration made in Exh. "D".  The only correction in said certificate is
in its registry number.  Mrs. Lopez says
that the number is 5846.  The correction
is not initialed.  Mrs. Lopez however
attributes the lack of initial to oversight on their part.  They could not avoid making mistakes or
errors because of the volume of registration(s) that they make daily.</blockquote>

<blockquote>What is the probative value of Exh. "D" against Judge
Villanueva?  Does it establish his
paternity of Ceasar Anthony P. Villanueva?  The answer is no.  Although Exh.
"D" is a public document, it is evidence only of the fact that gave
rise to its execution and of the date of the latter.  (Sec. 23, Rule 132).  Stated otherwise, it constitutes evidence only of the fact of birth of
Ceasar Anthony P. Villanueva on September 15, 1986.  It does not prove that Judge Villanueva is the father even if his
name is stated therein as the father.  Proof of his paternity must be established by other competent evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The other entries therein are mere hearsay insofar as Judge
Villanueva is concerned.  The truth of
said entries must be shown by other competent evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is another compelling reason why Exh. "D" can not
be considered as evidence of Judge Vilianueva's paternity of Ceasar Anthony P.
Villanueva.  The signature in the space
for the "Signature of Father" in Exh. "D-5" is not Judge
Villanueva's signature.  Arcadio Ramos,
the NBI handwriting expert, had examined said signature and Judge Villanueva's
sample signatures.  Mr. Ramos concluded
that the questioned signature in Exh. "D-5" and the standards or
sample signatures of Judge Villanueva (Exh. "4" to "11" and
Exhs. "14" to "19") were not written by one and the same
person.  (See Exh. "12",
"12"-A" and "12-B").   Clearly, Judge Villanueva did not affix the questioned signature
in Exh. "D-5".</blockquote>

<blockquote>The findings of Mr. Ramos is (sic) solidly grounded.  He had explained the significant differences
in handwriting characteristics between the questioned signature and the sample
signatures.  The differences can be
clearly discerned by a layman.  (See
Exhs. "13" to "13?U").  He had testified on the procedure that he took when he made the
examination.  He is an expert on
questioned documents.  His expertise was
acquired from his long years of experience and from studies that he had
undergone both here and abroad.  With
his qualifications and expertise, there is no reason why his testimony, backed
up by chart and documents, can not be given weight.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The absence of Judge Villanueva's signature in Exh. "D"
renders said exhibit inadmissible in evidence.  On this point, it has been held:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"If birth certificates, which are unsigned by the presumed
father as required by Section 5 of Act. No. 3753, and Art. 250 of the Civil
Code, are incompetent evidence even to prove paternity alone, with more reasons
are birth certificates incompetent evidence to prove recognized
filiation." (Victoria Baluyot, et al., represented by Norma Urbano vs.
Felicidad Baluyot and the Honorable Court of Appeals, decided June 14, 1990,
Case Digest of Supreme Court Decisions, Vol. 7, No. 1, June 1-27, 1990, page
440).</p>

<blockquote>Since Exh. "D" is not admissible against Judge Villanueva
as proof of his filiation to Ceasar Anthony P. Villanueva and there is no other
direct and primary proof showing that he ha(d) an illicit affair with his
co-respondent, his exoneration is therefore in order.  Clearly, there is no clear and convincing evidence against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Pacaco admits having (the) care and custody of Ceasar
Anthony.  Aside from her admission,
there are other competent evidence showing that said child is under her care.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exhibit "D" contains entries that show or tend to show
that she is the mother of Ceasar Anthony.  The middle name of the child is stated therein as "Pacaco."
(Exh. "D-2").  The mother's
maiden name is stated as "Haide Pacaco." (Exh. "D-­4").  The signature of the informant clearly reads
"hbpacaco." (Exh. "D-4").  In the affidavit of acknowledgment (Exh. "D-5"), the name "Heide
B. Pacaco" is clearly written therein.  In the space for the signature of the mother is the signature which
clearly reads "hbpacaco".  The
signature in Exh. "D-4" and the handwritten entries in Exh.
"D-5", including the signature "hbpacaco," are all written
in green ink in the original birth certificate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has been stated above that public documents are evidence only of
the facts which gave rise to their execution and of the date of the
latter.  Pursuant thereto, only the fact
of birth of Ceasar Anthony on September 15, 1986 may be admitted as evidence
against respondent Pacaco.  But there
are compelling factors that negate the application of said rule insofar as
respondent Heide Pacaco is concerned.  These factors are discussed below.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The signatures "hbpacaco" in the column for the informant
(Exh. "D-4") and in the affidavit of acknowledgment (Exh.
"D-5") are strikingly similar to the signatures that said respondent
affixed to her answer to the complaint.  (See pages 15 &amp; 16 of the record).  The similarities can be clearly discerned.  One need not be a handwriting expert to notice the similarities.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Pacaco has been the Clerk of Court of Judge Villanueva
for about twelve years.  Considering
their official relationship during that period, it is but natural for Judge
Villanueva to acquire knowledge of Heidi Pacaco's handwriting.  He had always seen her write.  He had probably seen her affixed (sic) her
signatures for countless times.  He had
seen writings purporting to be hers upon which he had acted or been
charged.  Because of their long
association, Judge Villanueva can undoubtedly identify Heide Pacaco's
handwriting or signature.  And this is
precisely what he did in this case.  When he was shown the signature "hbpacaco" in Exh.
"D-4", he answered that the said signature looks like Pacaco's
signature.  (tsn., pages 11 to 12,
hearing of June 18, 1991).  When he was
shown the signature "hbpacaco" in Exh. "D-5", he also
answered that the same "seems to be that of the Clerk of Court, Heide
Pacaco." (tsn., page 13, hearing of June 18, 1991).  Judge Villanueva's identification of the
above signatures constitutes proof that respondent Pacaco owns those
signatures.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Arcadio Ramos, the NBI handwriting expert, when shown the
signatures "hbpacaco" in Exhs. "D-4" and "D-5",
testified that said signatures appear to have been written by one and the same
person.  He based his opinion on the
fact that both signatures have good line quality, the same pictorial appearance
and the same letter combination (tsn., pp. 37 to 38, hearing of November 8, 1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Because of the foregoing considerations, the undersigned is
convinced that the signatures "hbpacaco" in the certificate of live
birth of Ceasar Anthony Pacaco Villanueva belong to respondent Heide Pacaco.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Is respondent Heide Pacaco the mother of Ceasar Anthony P.
Villanueva, the child who was enrolled in the nursery class of Montessori in
Isulan in school year 1990-1991?  The
undersigned is convinced that she is the mother.  The signatures that she affixed in the birth certificate of
Ceasar Anthony are admissions of her filiation with the latter.  They are evidence against her.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘The act, declaration or admission of a party as to a relevant fact
may be given in evidence against him." (Sec. 26, Rule 132)</p>

<blockquote>Judge Villanueva has testified about the antagonism, insolence and
evasiveness of Heide Pacaco when he confronted her about Exh.
"D".  This fact was confirmed
by Pacaco.  Instead of explaining or
denying, she acted unnaturally.  Her
outburst is contrary to human experience and behavior.  Instead of admitting or denying that Ceasar
Anthony is her son, she told Judge Villanueva that the latter is not the only
Villanueva in the world.  (tsn., page
12, hearing of June 18, 1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The undersigned is not convinced that Ceasar Anthony P. Villanueva
is Caesar Anthony Paciente Villanueva, the son of spouses Helen Paciente and
Oscar Villanueva, who was entrusted to the care of respondent Pacaco.  Said respondent could not even recall when
the child was entrusted to her by her alleged second cousin Helen
Paciente.  She alleged that she has a
very close relationship with the latter yet she could not recall when her
second cousin left for Saudi Arabia.  She does not know when Helen allegedly got married to Oscar Villanueva.  These things, trivial they may seem, are
competent guage (sic) in determining when one is telling the truth or not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Helen Paciente is allegedly communicating with her and sending her
money for the sustenance and schooling of Caesar Anthony.  Yet respondent Pacaco was unable to present
in evidence any letter, telegram, postcard or picture that her cousin might
have sent her.  She has not presented
any advice or notice from Helen evidencing remittances of money that the latter
sent to her from Saudi Arabia.  No
bankbook showing deposits of money that she made in behalf of Caesar Anthony
has been presented.  Moreover, if the
child had actually been entrusted to her care, she could have taken the pain of
enrolling him at Montessori or signing his progress report card or Form
138.  She could not have entrusted the
said chores to a mere "yaya" like Judith Barraca.  She could have attended programs or school
activities of Montessori, considering that she is the guardian of Caesar
Anthony.  She could have introduced
Helen Paciente To Gemma Panagdato, the teacher of Caesar Anthony and her
neighbor, when the former allegedly went home on vacation in December
1990.  She could have brought Helen to
Ceasar Anthony's school and introduced her to the teachers and the principal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As per Exhibit "1-Pacaco", the birth of Caesar Anthony
Paciente Villanueva was registered under the late registration system.  The same was registered after the filing of
this case.  Its registration was
effected on January 9, 1991 upon respondent Pacaco's advice.  Said respondent allegedly advised Helen
Paciente to register the birth of Caesar Anthony because of the misconception
of people that she is the mother.  The
undersigned is not convinced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Caesar Anthony Paciente Villanueva was allegedly born in San Roque,
Makar, General Santos City on September 13, 1985.  His birth was allegedly attended by Dr. Jesus Alicarte.  The parents were supposedly married.  Despite these considerations, his birth was
not registered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>General Santos City is highly urbanized.  As a matter of fact, it is one of (the) growth centers not only
of Mindanao but of the Philippines.  It
is unbelievable that a physician, who is connected with a government hospital
and well-versed in the registration of births, would forget to register the
birth of a child which he attended.  Exhibit "1-Pacaco" is clearly a belated attempt on the part of
respondent Pacaco to hid(e) her maternity of Ceasar Anthony Pacaco Villanueva.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Who is the father of Ceasar Anthony Pacaco Villanueva?  There is no evidence presented as to his
paternity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The absence of evidence as to the paternity of Ceasar Anthony
Pacaco Villanueva is not however of utmost importance insofar as the resolution
of this case is concerned.  What matters
is whether or not the offense charged has been committed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having a child with a man, though unknown, is gross immorality for
an unmarried woman in government service.  It constitutes just cause for administrative sanction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The undersigned finds that there exists substantial and convincing
evidence against respondent Heide Pacaco for gross immorality.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Investigating Judge Sucaldito consequently recommended the
separation from the service of respondent Heide B. Pacaco and the exoneration
of respondent Judge Osmundo M. Villanueva for lack of evidence against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have thoroughly reviewed the testimonial and documentary
evidence vis-a-vis the findings and conclusion of the investigating judge and
we find that respondent Heide B. Pacaco is indeed guilty as charged.  The only defense resorted to by respondent
Pacaco, that of mere denial, is glaringly weak and unavailing.  She simply denies that the signature
appearing on the Certificate of Live Birth of Ceasar Anthony Pacaco Villanueva,
marked in evidence as Exhibit "D," belongs to her.  However, when the investigating judge
suggested during the hearing that her signature be likewise submitted to the
NBI for examination, her counsel manifested that he will consult the NBI expert
when the latter is presented as witness for respondent Judge Villanueva.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
But then the records will show that the same was never done by respondent
Pacaco nor her counsel, despite the fact that a favorable result could
necessarily have bolstered her assertions of innocence and her claim that she
did not sign Exhibit "D." There was nothing to prevent respondent
Pacaco from submitting her questioned signature for examination, and she could
not have been unaware of the importance thereof.  The lame excuse offered by her counsel, that they might not be
able to shoulder the expenses, is unacceptable considering that the
investigating judge had already informed them that the examination could be
made without expense since respondent Pacaco is a government employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the signature appearing in Exhibit "D" actually
belongs to respondent Heide B. Pacaco was confirmed by respondent Judge
Villanueva when, upon being confronted with said certificate of live birth, he
testified that it seems to be the signature of respondent Pacaco.  It is not denied that respondent Pacaco has
been the clerk of court of Judge Villanueva for about twelve years, hence, it
is safe to conclude that the latter is very familiar with the former's
signature.  Significantly, respondent
Pacaco did not counter the aforesaid testimony of respondent Judge Villanueva,
save for her aforestated general denial of having signed Exhibit "D."
Under the present Section 22 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, the handwriting
of a person may be proved by any witness who believes it to be the handwriting
of such person, because he has seen the person write, or has seen writing
purporting to be his upon which the witness has acted or been charged, and has
thus acquired knowledge of the handwriting of such person.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said section further provides that evidence respecting the
handwriting may also be given by a comparison, made by the witness <u>or the
court</u>, with writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party against
whom the evidence is offered or proved to be genuine to the satisfaction of the
judge.  As noted by the investigating
judge in his report, in the record of this case is a copy of respondent
Pacaco's answer to the complaint, the first and second pages whereof are signed
by her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
We have carefully compared the signatures "hbpacaco" thereon and the
signatures "hbpacaco" marked as Exhibits "D-4" and
"D-5" on the birth certificate a copy of which is in the record of
this case,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and we are reasonably convinced of the authorship by respondent Pacaco of the
questioned signatures on Exhibit "D," the birth certificate of Ceasar
Anthony Pacaco Villanueva.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we have heretofore stated, the exacting standards of ethics
and morality imposed upon court employees and judges are reflective of the
premium placed on the image of the courts of justice, and that image of a court
of justice is necessarily mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of
the men and women who work thereat, from the judge to the least and lowest of
its personnel.  It thus becomes the
imperative and sacred duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its
good name and standing as a true temple of justice.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We consequently agree with and hereby APPROVE the report and
recommendation submitted by Investigating Judge Romeo S. Sucaldito finding
respondent Heide B. Pacaco, Clerk of Court of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court
of Bagumbayan-Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, GUILTY of gross immorality and
recommending her separation from the service.  Accordingly, said respondent is hereby dismissed from her present
position with forfeiture of retirement benefits, except accrued leave credits,
and with disqualification from any appointive position in the Government,
including government?owned or controlled corporations.  The complaint against Judge Osmundo M.
Villanueva is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.</p>
