otherwise known as the "Bases Conversion and Development Act of
1992," under which respondent Mayor Richard J. Gordon of Olongapo City was
appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Subic Bay Metropolitan
Authority (SBMA), is challenged in this original petition with prayer for
prohibition, preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order "to
prevent useless and unnecessary expenditures of public funds by way of salaries
and other operational expenses attached to the office x x x x”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Paragraph (d) reads –</p>

<blockquote>"(d) <i>Chairman/Administrator</i>
– The President shall appoint a professional manager as administrator of the
Subic Authority with a compensation to be determined by the Board subject to
the approval of the Secretary of Budget, who shall be the <u>ex</u> <u>officio</u>

Subic Authority:  <i>Provided, however,

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, who claim to be taxpayers, employees of the U.S.
Facility at Subic, Zambales, and officers and members of the Filipino Civilian
Employees Association in U. S.  Facilities in the Philippines, maintain that the proviso in par. (d) of
Sec. 13 herein-above quoted in italics infringes on the following
constitutional and statutory provisions:  (a) Sec. 7, first par., Art. IX-B, of the Constitution, which states
that “<i>[n]o elective official shall be eligible for appointment or
designation in any capacity to any public office or position during his tenure</i>,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
because the City Mayor of Olongapo City is an elective official and the subject
posts are public offices; (b) Sec. 16, Art. VII, of the Constitution, which
provides that "[t]he President shall xxx x appoint all other officers of
the Government whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by law, and
those whom he may be authorized by law to appoint",<a style="mso-footnote-id:

appointing officer of a government office, agency or instrumentality, whether
national or local, including government-owned or controlled corporations, who
appoints or hires any new employee, whether provisional, temporary or casual,
or creates and fills any new position, except upon prior authority of the
Commission.  The Commission shall not
grant the authority sought unless it is satisfied that the position to be
filled is essential to the proper functioning of the office or agency
concerned, and that the position shall not be filled in a manner that may
influence the election.  As an exception
to the foregoing provisions, a new employee may be appointed in case of urgent
need:  Provided, however, That notice of
the appointment shall be given to the Commission within three days from the
date of the appointment.  Any
appointment or hiring in violation of this provision shall be null and

government official or employee, including those in government-owned or
controlled corporations x x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">for the reason that the appointment of
respondent Gordon to the subject posts made by respondent Executive Secretary
on 3 April 1992 was within the prohibited 45-day period prior to the 11 May
1992 Elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal question is whether the proviso in Sec. 13, par.
(d), of R.A. 7227 which states, "<i>Provided, however, That for the first
year of its operations from the effectivity of this Act, the mayor of the City
of Olongapo shall be appointed as the chairman and chief executive officer of
the Subic Authority</i>," violates the constitutional proscription against
appointment or designation of elective officials to other government posts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In full, Sec. 7 of Art. IX-B of the Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote>"No elective official shall be eligible for appointment or
designation in any capacity to any public office or position during his tenure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Unless otherwise allowed by law or by the primary functions of his
position, no appointive official shall hold any other office or employment in
the Government or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including
government-owned or controlled corporations or their subsidiaries.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The section expresses the policy against the concentration of
several public positions in one person, so that a public officer or employee
may serve full-time with dedication and thus be efficient in the delivery of
public services.  It is an affirmation
that a public office is a full-time job.  Hence, a public officer or employee, like the head of an executive
department described in <i>Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary</i>,
G.R. No. 83896, and<i> Anti-Graft League of the Philippines, Inc. v. Philip
Ella C. Juico, as Secretary of Agrarian Reform</i>, G.R. No. 83815,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
"x x x x should be allowed to attend to his duties and responsibilities
without the distraction of other governmental duties or employment.  He should be precluded from dissipating his
efforts, attention and energy among too many positions of responsibility, which
may result in haphazardness and inefficiency x x x x"</p>

<p class="BODY">Particularly as regards the first paragraph of Sec. 7,
"(t)he basic idea really is to prevent a situation where a local elective
official will work for his appointment in an executive position in government,
and thus neglect his constituents x x x x"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case before us, the subject proviso directs the President
to appoint an elective official, i.e., the Mayor of Olongapo City, to other
government posts (as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of
SBMA).  Since this is precisely what the
constitutional proscription seeks to prevent, it needs no stretching of the
imagination to conclude that the proviso contravenes Sec. 7, first par., Art.
IX-B, of the Constitution.  Here, the
fact that the expertise of an elective official may be most beneficial to the
higher interest of the body politic is of no moment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that Sec. 94 of the Local Government Code (LGC)
permits the appointment of a local elective official to another post if so
allowed by law or by the primary functions of his office.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
But, the contention is fallacious.  Section 94 of the LGC is not determinative of the the constitutionality
of Sec. 13, par. (d), of R.A. 7227, for no legislative act can prevail over the
fundamental law of the land.  Moreover,
since the constitutionality of Sec. 94 of LGC is not the issue here nor is that
section sought to be declared unconstitutional, we need not rule on its
validity.  Neither can we invoke a
practice otherwise unconstitutional as authority for its validity.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, the view that an elective official may be appointed
to another post if allowed by law or by the primary functions of his office,
ignores the clear-cut difference in the wording of the two (2) paragraphs of
Sec. 7, Art. IX-B, of the Constitution.  While the second paragraph authorizes holding of multiple offices by an <u>appointive</u>
official when allowed by law or by the primary functions of his position, the
first paragraph appears to be more stringent by not providing any exception to
the rule against appointment or designation of an <u>elective</u> official to
other government posts, except as are particularly recognized in the
Constitution itself, e.g., the President as head of the economic and planning
agency;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the Vice?President, who may be appointed Member of the Cabinet;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and, a member of Congress who may be designated <i>ex officio</i> member of the
Judicial and Bar Council.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The distinction between the first and second paragraphs of Sec.
7, Art. IX-B, was not accidental when drawn, and not without reason.  It was purposely sought by the drafters of
the Constitution as shown in their deliberation, thus –</p>

<blockquote>"<i>MR.
MONSOD.  In other words, what the
Commissioner is saying, Mr. Presiding Officer, is that the prohibition is more
strict with respect to elective officials, because in the case of appointive
officials, there may be a law that will allow them to hold other positions.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<i>MR.
FOZ.  Yes.  I suggest we make that difference, because in the case of
appointive officials, there will be certain situations where the law should
allow them to hold some other positions</i>.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The distinction being clear, the
exemption allowed to appointive officials in the second paragraph cannot be
extended to elective officials who are governed by the first paragraph.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further argued that the SBMA posts are merely <i>ex</i> <i>officio</i>
to the position of Mayor of Olongapo City, hence, an excepted circumstance,
citing <i>Civil Liberties Union v. Executive Secretary</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
where we stated that the prohibition against the holding of any other office or
employment by the President, Vice-President, Members of the Cabinet, and their
deputies or assistants during their tenure, as provided in Sec. 13, Art. VII,
of the Constitution, does not comprehend additional duties and functions <i>required
by the primary functions of the officials concerned, who are to perform them in
an ex officio capacity as provided by law, without receiving any additional
compensation therefor</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is apparently based on a wrong premise.  Congress did not contemplate making the
subject SBMA posts as <i>ex</i> <i>officio</i> or automatically attached to the
Office of the Mayor of Olongapo City without need of appointment.  The phrase "shall be appointed"
unquestionably shows the intent to make the SBMA posts appointive and not
merely adjunct to the post of Mayor of Olongapo City.  Had it been the legislative intent to make the subject positions <i>ex</i>
<i>officio</i>, Congress would have, at least, avoided the word
"appointed" and, instead, "<i>ex</i> <i>officio</i>" would
have been used.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even in the Senate deliberations, the Senators were fully aware
that subject proviso may contravene Sec.7, first par., Art. IX-B, but they nevertheless
passed the bill and decided to have the controversy resolved by the
courts.  Indeed, the Senators would not
have been concerned with the effects of Sec. 7, first par., had they considered
the SBMA posts as <i>ex</i> <i>officio</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cognizant of the complication that may arise from the way the
subject proviso was stated, Senator Rene Saguisag remarked that "if the
Conference Committee just said 'the Mayor shall be the Chairman’, then that
should foreclose the issue.  It is a
legislative choice.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The Senator took a view that the constitutional proscription against
appointment of elective officials may have been sidestepped if Congress
attached the SBMA posts to the Mayor of Olongapo City instead of directing the
President to appoint him to the post.  Without passing upon this view of Senator Saguisag, it suffices to state
that Congress intended the posts to be appointive, thus nibbling in the bud the
argument that they are <i>ex</i> <i>officio</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The analogy with the position of Chairman of the Metro Manila
Authority made by respondents cannot be applied to uphold the constitutionality
of the challenged proviso since it is not put in issue in the present
case.  In the same vein, the argument
that if no elective official may be appointed or designated to another post
then Sec. 8, Art. IX-B, of the Constitution allowing him to receive double
compensation<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
would be useless, is <i>non</i> <i>sequitur</i> since Sec. 8 does not affect
the constitutionality of the subject proviso.  In any case, the Vice-President for example, an elective official who
may be appointed to a cabinet post under Sec. 3, Art. VII, may receive the
compensation attached to the cabinet position if specifically authorized by
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also assail the legislative encroachment on the
appointing authority of the President.  Section 13, par. (d), itself vests in the President the power to appoint
the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of SBMA, although he
really has no choice under the law but to appoint the Mayor of Olongapo City.</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be defined, an "appointment" is "[t]he
designation of a person, by the person or persons having authority therefor, to
discharge the duties of some office or trust,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
or "[t]he selection or designation of a person, by the person or persons
having authority therefor, to fill an office or public function and discharge
the duties of the same.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In his treatise, <i>Philippine Political Law</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Senior Associate Justice Isagani A. Cruz defines appointment as "the selection,
by the authority vested with the power, of an individual who is to exercise the
functions of a given office."</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that appointment calls for a selection, the
appointing power necessarily exercises a discretion.  According to Woodbury, J.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
"the <i>choice</i> of a person to fill an office constitutes the essence
of his appointment,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
and Mr. Justice Malcolm adds that an "[a]ppointment to office is
intrinsically an executive act involving the exercise of discretion."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
In <i>Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
we held:</p>

<blockquote>The power to appoint is, in essence, discretionary.  The appointing power has the right of choice
which he may exercise freely according to his judgment, deciding for himself
who is best qualified among those who have the necessary qualifications and
eligibilities.  It is a prerogative of
the appointing power x x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Indeed, the power of choice is the heart
of the power to appoint.  Appointment
involves an exercise of discretion of whom to appoint; it is not a ministerial
act of issuing appointment papers to the appointee.  In other words, the choice of the appointee is a fundamental
component of the appointing power.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, when Congress clothes the President with the power to
appoint an officer, it (Congress) cannot at the same time limit the choice of
the President to only one candidate.  Once the power of appointment is conferred on the President, such
conferment necessarily carries the discretion of whom to appoint.  Even on the pretext of prescribing the qualifications
of the officer, Congress may not abuse such power as to divest the appointing
authority, directly or indirectly, of his discretion to pick his own
choice.  Consequently, when the
qualifications prescribed by Congress can only be met by one individual, such
enactment effectively eliminates the discretion of the appointing power to
choose and constitutes an irregular restriction on the power of appointment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, while Congress willed that the subject posts
be filled with a presidential appointee for the first year of its operations
from the effectivity of R.A. 7227, the proviso nevertheless limits the
appointing authority to only one eligible, i.e., the incumbent Mayor of
Olongapo City.  Since only one can
qualify for the posts in question, the President is precluded from exercising
his discretion to choose whom to appoint.  Such supposed power of appointment, sans the essential element of
choice, is no power at all and goes against the very nature itself of
appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it may be viewed that the proviso merely sets the
qualifications of the officer during the first year of operations of SBMA,
i.e., he must be the Mayor of Olongapo City, it is manifestly an abuse of
congressional authority to prescribe qualifications where only one, and no
other, can qualify.  Accordingly, while
the conferment of the appointing power on the President is a perfectly valid
legislative act, the proviso limiting his choice to one is certainly an
encroachment on his prerogative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the ineligibility of an elective official for appointment
remains all throughout his tenure or during his incumbency, he may however
resign first from his elective post to cast off the constitutionally-attached
disqualification before he may be considered fit for appointment.  The deliberation in the Constitutional
Commission is enlightening:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>MR.
DAVIDE. <span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>On Section 4, page 3, line 8, I
propose the substitution of the word "term" with TENURE.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<i>MR.
FOZ. <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the proposed
amendment is to make possible for one to resign from his position.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<i>MR. DAVIDE.  Yes, we should allow that prerogative.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<i>MR.
FOZ.  <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Resign
from his position to accept an executive position.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<i>MR.
DAVIDE. Besides, it may turn out in a given case that because of, say,
incapacity, he may leave the service, but if he is prohibited from being
appointed within the term for which he was elected, we may be depriving the
government of the needed expertise of an individual.</i>”<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, as long as he is an incumbent, an elective official
remains ineligible for appointment to another public office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where, as in the case of respondent Gordon, an incumbent elective
official was, notwithstanding his ineligibility, appointed to other government
posts, he does not automatically forfeit his elective office nor remove his
ineligibility imposed by the Constitution.  On the contrary, since an incumbent elective official is not eligible to
the appointive position, his appointment or designation thereto cannot be valid
in view of his disqualification or lack of eligibility.  This provision should not be confused with
Sec. 13, Art. VI, of the Constitution where "(n)o Senator or Member of the
House of Representatives may hold any other office or employment in the
Government x x x during his term without forfeiting his seat x x x x" The
difference between the two provisions is significant in the sense that
incumbent national legislators lose their elective posts only after they have
been appointed to another government office, while other incumbent elective
officials must first resign their posts before they can be appointed, thus
running the risk of losing the elective post as well as not being appointed to
the other post.  It is therefore clear
that ineligibility is not directly related with forfeiture of office.  "x x x x The effect is quite different
where it is expressly provided by law that a person holding one office shall be
ineligible to another.  Such a provision
is held to incapacitate the incumbent of an office from accepting or holding a
second office (State ex rel. Van Antwerp v Hogan, 283 Ala. 445, 218 So 2d 258;
McWilliams v Neal, 130 Ga 733, 61 SE 721) and to render his election or
appointment to the latter office void (State ex rel. Childs v Sutton, 63 Minn
147, 65 NW 262.  Annotation:  40 ALR 945) or voidable (Baskin v State, 107

"Where the constitution or statutes declare that persons holding one
office shall be ineligible for election or appointment to another office,
either generally or of a certain kind, the prohibition has been held to
incapacitate the incumbent of the first office to hold the second so that any
attempt to hold the second is void (Ala. - State ex rel. Van Antwerp v. Hogan,

<p class="BODY">As incumbent elective official, respondent Gordon is ineligible
for appointment to the position of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive
Officer of SBMA; hence, his appointment thereto pursuant to a legislative act
that contravenes the Constitution cannot be sustained.  He however remains Mayor of Olongapo City,
and his acts as SBMA official are not necessarily null and void; he may be
considered a <i>de</i> <i>facto</i> officer, "one whose acts, though not
those of a lawful officer, the law, upon principles of policy and justice, will

Sotero Laurel which he expressed in the floor deliberations of S.B. 1648,

<blockquote>"x x x x (much) as we would like to have the present Mayor of
Olongapo City as the Chief Executive of this Authority that we are creating;
(much) as I, myself, would like to because I know the capacity, integrity, industry
and dedication of Mayor Gordon; (much) as we would like to give him this
terrific, burdensome and heavy responsibility, we cannot do it because of the
constitutional prohibition which is very clear.  It says:  ‘No elective
official shall be appointed or designated to another position in any
capacity.’"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

here.  It practically renders the
provision useless because the whole matter becomes discretionary with the
legislature.  It is one of those
instances in the 1973 Constitution, as amended and constantly reamended, where
they threw in the phrase 'Unless otherwise provided by law’ precisely to give
the President a free hand in his decree-making power.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
