				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue for resolution is whether or not public respondent
National Labor Relations Commission acted without or in excess of its
jurisdiction when it enter­tained private respondents' appeal although the
surety bond required under Sec. 223 of the Labor Code was filed 13 days after
the ten-day appeal period had expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts as summarized by the Solici­tor General are:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The petitioners were former regular security guards of the
Retired Army Protective and Security Agency Inc. (RAPSA) when they filed on
September 24, 1986 complaints against RAPSA and its President and Director,
Herminia Crisologo, and Ms. Malou Alviar for illegal deduc­tion, underpayment
of wages, over­time pay, legal holiday pay, premium pay for rest day, unpaid
differential and allowances pursuant to Wage Orders Nos. 3, 4, 5, and 6, shoe
allowances and separation pay.  In their
Position Paper filed on December 16, 1986, petitioners impleaded private
respondent ESA Protective and Security Agency (ESAPSA).</p>

<p class="2Q">"Private respondent ESAPSA's principal contention was that
peti­tioners were not its employees, ESAPSA allegedly being a corporation
separate and distinct from RAPSA.  Ms.
Malou Alviar insisted that she was neither a Director nor an emplo­yee of
RAPSA, but only of ESAPSA.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On February 26, 1990, Labor Arbiter Ricardo C. Nora, applying
the doctrine of piercing the veil of corporate entity, and finding that RAPSA
and ESAPSA were indeed one and the same, declared that justice and equity
dictate that RAPSA, ESAPSA, Ms. Herminia A. Crisologo and Ms. Malou Alviar were
jointly and sever­ally liable to petitioners' monetary claims.  Hence, it disposed:</p>

<p class="3Q">"'WHEREFORE, respondent RAPSA, ESAPSA, Ms. Herminia A.
Crisologo and Ms. Malou Alviar are hereby ordered to pay the following
complainants the monetary award opposite their names jointly and severally, to
wit:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Private respondents ESAPSA and Ms. Malou Alviar were notified
of the Decision on April 3, 1990.  On
April 10, 1990, private respondents filed their Memorandum on Appeal, without,
however, posting the requisite bond for the monetary judgment of P155,052.94.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On April 18, 1990, petition­ers moved for execution of the
Labor Arbiter's Decision.  On April 20,
1990, petitioners filed their Oppo­sition to the Memorandum on Appeal, principally
raising the issue that the appeal of private respondents had not been perfected
for failure to post the requisite bond within the reglementary period, hence,
the judgment appealed from had become final and executory.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On April 26, 1990, private respondents belatedly posted their
bond in the amount of one hundred fifty five thousand fifty two pesos and
94/100 (P155,052.94), allegedly in compliance with R.A. No. 6715.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Subsequently, on November 2, 1990, petitioners filed a
‘Motion to Dismiss Appeal and to Remand Records for Execution,’ raising the
same issue of non-perfection of the appeal.  No action was made on the same.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On August 2, 1991, without touching on the issue regarding
the timeliness of the appeal, public respondent issued the questioned
Resolution modifying the Labor Arbi­ter's Decision and disposed:</p>

<p class="2Q">"'WHEREFORE, premises consid­ered, the decision appealed from
is hereby affirmed with modification in that ESAPSA and Malou Alviar are
absolved from any liability anent the money awards due herein
complainants.'" (pp. 98-101, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised and to be resolved in this in­stance are:</p>

<p class="2Q">1.  whether or not public
respondent NLRC acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction when it
entertained private respondents' appeal although the surety bond required under
Sec. 223 of the Labor Code was filed 13 days after the ten-day appeal period
had expired;</p>

<p class="2Q">2.  whether or not private
respondents ESAPSA and Alviar may be held jointly and severally liable with
their co-defendant RAPSA for petitioners' monetary claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The New Rules of Procedure of the National Labor Relations
Commission, which among others implemented the provisions of R.A. 6715, were
adopted and promulgated only on August 31, 1990 in Cebu City, Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">The effectivity clause of the New Rules provide that "These
New Rules shall take effect <u>fifteen</u> <u>(15)</u> <u>days</u> <u>after</u>
<u>their</u> <u>publication</u> <u>in</u> <u>two</u> <u>(2)</u> <u>newspapers</u>
<u>of</u> <u>general</u> <u>circulation</u>." (Underlining supplied.) The
New Rules were published in The Manila Bulletin on Septem­ber 24, 1990.  Thus, the New Rules of Procedure became
effective only on October 9, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">When respondents-appellants' appeal memorandum became due in
April, 1990, the New Rules of Procedure <u>were</u> <u>not</u> <u>yet</u> <u>in</u>
<u>effect</u>.  Prior to the effectivity
of those Rules, the filing of a surety bond was not required for the perfection
of an appeal to the NLRC. The NLRC correctly refrained from dismissing the re­spondents'
appeal on that score.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue regarding the liability of ESAPSA for the petitioners'
money claims against RAPSA, the NLRC in its decision, held:</p>

<blockquote>"The Labor Arbiter x x x erroneously conjured that something
binds RAPSA and ESAP­SA, based on the phrases contained in the letter, dated 4
August, 1986, sent by respond­ent Malou Alviar to China Banking Corporation, to
wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'x x x.  The latter
agency will in turn take over all obliga­tions and responsibilities of RAPSA, x
x x.  We propose that we merely
substitute the name of ESAPSA for that of RAPSA in our new contract.  The RAPSA officers and guards who are
presently assigned to your bank will all be absorbed by ESAPSA.'</p>

<blockquote>"Without the omitted portions, the letter reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"<u>'All</u> <u>our</u> <u>corporate</u> <u>and</u> <u>admin­istrative</u>
<u>officials</u> <u>have</u> <u>had</u> <u>extensive</u> <u>and</u> <u>long</u>
<u>experience</u> <u>in</u> <u>operating</u> <u>and</u> <u>managing</u> <u>security</u>
<u>agencies</u>.  <u>May</u> <u>we</u>, <u>therefore</u>,
<u>propose</u> <u>and</u> <u>request</u> <u>that</u> <u>your</u> <u>present</u>
<u>security</u> <u>contract</u> <u>with</u> <u>RAPSA</u> <u>be</u> <u>transferred</u>
<u>to</u> <u>our</u> <u>agency</u> <u>ESAPSA</u>.  The latter agency will in turn take over all obligations and
responsi­bilities of RAPSA.  <u>ESAPSA</u>
<u>is</u> <u>will­ing</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>terms</u> <u>and</u> <u>conditions</u>
<u>of</u> <u>present</u> <u>security</u> <u>contract</u> <u>with</u> <u>RAPSA</u>
<u>will</u> <u>be</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>contract</u>
<u>we</u> <u>will</u> <u>sign</u> <u>and</u> <u>execute</u> <u>with</u> <u>you</u>
<u>including</u> <u>the</u> <u>present</u> <u>contract</u> <u>rate</u>.  We propose that we merely substitute the
name ESAPSA for that of RAPSA in our new contract.  The RAPSA offi­cers and guards who are presently assigned to your
bank will be absorbed by ESAPSA.' (Underscoring supplied).</p>

<blockquote>"A careful review of the whole text of the letter, without the
expressly omitted portions, which are underlined would indicate that ESAPSA was
merely more than willing to give China Banking Corporation the same compo­sition
of security guards, if the Bank was satisfied with services of the present
complement.  The obligations and
responsibilities spoken of clearly refer to the obligation of RAPSA to the bank
and was never meant to assume the obligation of RAPSA to the security guards,
since the purpose was to solicit a client, not to recruit the security
guards.  The letter was not to appease
the security guards, but to assure a prospective client of worthwhile
services." (pp. 60-61, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These factual findings of the NLRC are not cor­rectible by <i>certiorari</i>
(Manila Hotel Corp. vs. NLRC, 141 SCRA 169).  In fact they are binding on this Court in the absence of any showing
that they are completely without any support in the evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no grave abuse of discretion nor excess
of jurisdiction in the decision of the Na­tional Labor Relations Commission,
the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is DISMISSED for lack of merit.</p>
