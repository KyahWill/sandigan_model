Building Co., Inc. and Myers Building Co., 43 SCRA 93 the Supreme Court

"automatic rescission" (without prior need of judicial rescission,
resolution or cancellation) is VALID, the remedy of one who feels aggrieved
being to go to Court for the cancellation of the rescission itself, in case the
rescission is found unjustified under the circumstances, still in the instant
case there is a clear WAIVER of the stipulated right of "automatic
rescission", as evidenced by the <u>many</u> <u>extensions</u> granted
private respondents by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
