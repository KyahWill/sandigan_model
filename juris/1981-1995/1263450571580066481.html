two land registration cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> and their
mother, brothers and sisters <span style="">filed in </span><span style="">1938 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> two
applications for the registration of certain lots with a total area of <u>61.7

La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> (36 </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">O.G</span></span><span style="">. </span><span style="">1409 and 1437).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The applications were filed by lawyer Sinai C. Hamada.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were opposed by the Directors of Land
and Forestry, Gold River Mining Co., Inc., <span class="SpellE">Paran</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayotao</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bernabe</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Oblas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Locloc</span> and others (Land Registration Cases <span style="">Nos. </span>149 and 150, <span class="SpellE">GLRO</span>
Records Nos. 52538 and 52539; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">J
and X).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The original records of the two cases were lost during the
war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that no decree
was issued in the said cases and that no <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> titles
were obtained by the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> family.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bone of contention now is whether, as contended by the
Government, Judge <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> Buenaventura denied the
applications for <span class="GramE">registration</span> in a 1939 decision, or
whether, as pretended by Jose Castro, Judge Jose R. Carlos granted the said
applications in a supposed 1941 decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">For more than fifteen years since the outbreak of the war, the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> family did absolutely nothing to reconstitute the
records of the two cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, on March 18, 1959, the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>
brothers and sisters named <span class="SpellE">Magasia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albina</span>, <span class="SpellE">Vencina</span> (illiterates), <span class="SpellE">Piscong</span>, Sergio and Pedro, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>,
executed<span style=""> a power of attorney
authorizing their brother <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span> to enter into
negotiations for the "reconstruction" of the land registration
proceeding in Case No. 149 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On that same date, <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> entered into an agreement with Jose Castro, a
private land surveyor, whereby the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> family
bound itself to cede to Castro forty percent of the land involved in Case No.
149 as his compensation for the "reconstruction" of the survey and
registration of the <span style="">said land. Castro
would shoulder all the expenses (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>
in a power of attorney dated March 22, 1959 authorized Castro to
"reconstruct the registration papers" pertaining to the second case,
Case No. 150, involving the land surveyed as Psu-15440, with an area of <u><span style="">26.4 hectares,</span></u><span style=""> </span>and giving Castro forty percent of
the land as his compensation (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D).</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that in the 1959 agreements between the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> family and Castro no reference whatsoever was made
to any decision rendered by Judge Carlos directing the registration of the said
lands in the names of <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1959</st1:date>,
the land claimed by <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>
in Case No. 150 <span style="">was </span>resurveyed as <u><span style="">Psu-181571</span></u><span style=""> </span>and a second lot with an area of <u><span style="">9.1 hectares</span></u><span style=""> </span>was added so that the expanded area
claimed by <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> has an area of <u><span style="">35.5 hectares </span></u>(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
H).</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1963</st1:date> when Castro filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> <span style="">a </span>petition for the reconstitution of
the records of Cases Nos. 149 and 150.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He filed the petition as owner <span style="">of
forty percent </span>of the lands <span style="">involved
in the two cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> family did not join him in that petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castro prayed that sixty percent of the </span>lands
be registered in the names of <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> and forty percent in his name.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Castro annexed to his
petition a copy of the 1935 plan </span>Psu-100666 for the two lots <span style="">involved in Case No. </span>149.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for the lot involved in Case <span style="">No. </span>150, with an area of <u>26.4</u>
hectares, Psu-15440 (prewar survey), he annexed to his petition a <u>1959</u>
survey plan, <u>Psu-181571</u>, which<span style="">,
as noted </span><span style="">above, </span><span style="">covers two </span>lots <span style="">with a total area of </span><u><span style="">35.5 hectares</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. </span>H). <span class="GramE">The</span> technical
descriptions for the said <span style="">two </span>lots
<span style="">were </span>prepared by Castro as
private <span style="">land </span>surveyor based on a
<u>1959</u> survey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The area of the land
claimed in Case No. 150 was increased from <u>twenty-six to thirty-five
hectares</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">That unwarranted augmentation of the area of the land <span style="">involved in Case No. 150 </span>should be
sufficient to alert a court<span style=""> </span><span style="">of justice to the </span>fraudulent character
of Castro's <span style="">petition
for</span> reconstitution in which <span style="">the
original </span>applicants for registration <span style="">did not join.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But
</span><span style="">what </span>is more remarkable
and unusual is <span style="">that Castro </span>annexed to that petition a supposed joint decision
rendered <span style="">by </span><span style="">Judge Carlos </span><span style="">on Jun</span><span style="">e 17, 1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that decision</span> Judge Carlos
supposedly <span style="">confirmed the title of <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> </span>to the <span style="">two lots covered by Case No. 149 </span>and <span style="">the </span>title <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>
<span style="">to the lot involved in Case No. 150 (p.
</span>34, <span style="">Record on Appeal).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for reconstitution was <span style="">opposed by the Directors of </span>Land and Forestry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged in their opposition that in a
decision dated December 5, 1939 Judge <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
Buenaventura dismissed the applications in Cases <span style="">Nos. </span>149 and 150 (pp. 80-86, 116-18, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">That opposition gave rise to the issue of whether Cases Nos. 149
and 150 were decided or closed cases as to which reconstitution of records
would not be necessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">David <span style="">V. </span><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> alleged in his opposition that <span class="SpellE">Albina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> had ceded to him in 1960 forty percent of
the 26-hectare land involved in Case No. 150 (p. 52, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Paran</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayotao</span>,
et al. in their opposition alleged that the lands involved in Cases Nos. 149
and 150 were sold on <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="12">December 18,
 1961</st1:date> by <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> to
Jesus S. <span class="SpellE">Yujuico</span> and are the object of Land
Registration Case No. N-86, <span class="SpellE">LRC</span> Record No. 22180, <span class="SpellE">Yujuico</span> vs. Director of Lands (p. 65, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">The National Power Corporation alleged in its opposition that it
had bought portions of the lands in question from <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> and that it has been occupying those
portions as the site of its <span class="SpellE">Beckel</span> Hydroelectric
Substation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, other portions
were granted to it for the exercise of its right-of-way easements (pp. 68-71,
Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, Judge Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>
dismissed the petition for reconstitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Castro appealed to the Court of Appeals which in its decision
promulgated on <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1979</st1:date>
<span style="">reversed the trial court's decision and
ordered the reconstitution of the records of Cases Nos. 149-R and 150-R in
accordance with Castro's evidence (Per Justice <span class="SpellE">Sundiam</span>,
with Justices Andres Reyes and Samuel F. Reyes, concurring).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Government appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castro did not file any <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Appeals is not supported by the
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Court ignored the
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record <span style="">conclusively shows that this reconstitution
proceeding is </span><span style="">a </span>brazen,
device or machination for <span class="SpellE">landgrabbing</span> and is a foolÂ­hardy
attempt to misappropriate public <span class="SpellE">forestal</span> and mineral
<span style="">lands </span>by means of a forged 1941
decision supposedly adjudiÂ­cating the lots in question to the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> family.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconstitution of judicial records under <span style="">Act </span>No. 3110 refers only to <u><span style="">pending</span></u><span style=""> </span>judicial
proceedings (<span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> vs. Cruz, 116 Phil. 1380; <span class="SpellE">Cenido</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 103 Phil. 1158).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Government's evidence in this case
indubitably proves that Land Registration Cases Nos. 149 and 150 were no longer
pending at the outbreak of the war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were closed cases because they were decided by Judge Buenaventura on <st1:date year="1939" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1939</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">dismissed
the applications because the lots applied for were <span class="SpellE">forestal</span>
and mineral lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal from hi<span style="">s </span>decision was not given due course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Judge Buenaventura's
decision denying the applications </span>of the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>
family is incontestably proven by a <span style="">copy
</span>thereof which was furnished by the provincial fiscal of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> to the district forester of
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That copy was preserved and <span style="">presented in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears the stamp of the district forester's
office, showing that the said copy was received on </span><st1:date year="1940" day="26" month="1"><span style="">January 26, 1940</span></st1:date><span style=""> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 7-f).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Patricio Perez, now a city judge of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>,
who was<span style=""> </span>the prewar assistant
fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and the Mountain ProÂ­vince,
testified that he appeared in the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> land regisÂ­tration
cases for the Directors of Lands and Forestry, that the cases were tried and
decided by Judge Buenaventura and not by Judge Carlos and that he was positive
that the said cases were terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Perez declared that the copy of Judge BuenaÂ­ventura's
decision, Exhibit 7, is authentic and that the latter prepared <span style="">his </span>decision in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
because he was only on detail in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
(198 <span style="">and </span>199 <span class="SpellE"><span style="">tsn</span></span><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the said cases were in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
of Judge Carlos, who was the district judge for <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> and the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>, it was<span style=""> </span>Judge Buenaventura who was assigned
to try and decide the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secretary of <span style="">Justice </span>Jose
<span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos in Administrative Order No. 83 dated July
8, 1939 designated Judge Buenaventura (then a Judge-at-large) "to hold
court at <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, Mountain Province, beginning August
10, 1939, or as soon thereafter as practicable, for the purpose of trying all
kinds of cases, and to enter final judgment therein" (37 <span class="SpellE">O.G</span>. 2963-4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Molintas</span></span><span style=""> cases were tried on September 11 and 12,
1939 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span></span><span style=""> N).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Attorney Hamada, the lawyer of applicants <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Albina</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>, produced a carbon copy of his memorandum dated
October 7, 1939 and also an undated copy of his "memorandum for motion of
reconsideration" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2 a<span style="">nd </span>3).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the signed copy of his "Exception and Motion for New
Trial" dated <st1:date year="1940" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1940</st1:date>,
he made specific reÂ­ference to the decision dated <st1:date year="1939" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1939</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the signed carbon copy of his "Motion for Reconsideration
of Order Disallowing Bill of Exceptions" dated March 6, 1940, Attorney Hamada
mentioned the fact that the trial court had not given due course to his appeal
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hamada also produced a carbon copy of the order of<span style=""> </span>Judge Carlos dated March 30, 1940
wherein Hamadaâs motion for reconsideration was denied and wherein it was categorically
stated that the decision in the said <span style="">cases
</span>had become <span style="">final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and for </span>that <span style="">reason the trial court could </span>not approve the record on appeal (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That same
order <span style="">was identified as genuine by
Fernando Romero, the prewar clerk of court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, if Judge Buenaventura's decision became final in the early
part of <u>1940</u> because the <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span> family
failed to appeal seasonably from his decision, the said land regisÂ­tration
proceedings were <u>closed</u> proceedings and Judge Carlos could not have decided
again those same cases in 1941.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, being <u><span style="">closed</span></u><span style=""> </span>cases, the reconstitution of the
records thereof was not authorized under Act No. 3110 which covers only <u>pending</u>
judicial proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lawyer Hamada was positive that the copy of the decision received
by the district forester from the office of the provincial fiscal of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> is an exact copy of Judge
Buenaventura's decision (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He remembered distinctly that the appliÂ­cations
were denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not have a copy of
the decision because his copy was delivered to <span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">When the supposed unsigned decision of Judge
Carlos <span style="">dated </span></span><st1:date year="1941" day="17" month="6"><span class="GramE"><span style="">June 17, 1941</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style=""> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span></span><span style=""> G) was shown to Hamada and examined by him
for a few <span class="GramE">minutes,</span> he unhesitatingly branded it as
"a complete falsity".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
added: "This supposed decision was never rendered by the Court in these
land registration cases" (150 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. See Mendoza
vs. De Castro, 107 Phil. 948).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Asked to justify his pronouncement that Exhibit G is a forgery,
Hamada declared that that decision mentions an octogenarian named <span class="SpellE">Parang</span> <span class="SpellE">Ducayag</span> as having
testified as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hamada declared
that <span class="SpellE">Ducayag</span> could not have been m<span style="">ore than fifty years of age in 1941 because
he personally knows </span><span class="SpellE">Ducayag</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hamada said that he knows the language of Judge Carlos and the
language in the supposed decision (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G) "is
very far from the language of the decision of Judge Carlos'' (151 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hamada further
observed that the supposed decision contains <span style="">t</span><span style="">ypographical
errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knows that Judge Carlos was
meticulous in preparing his decisions and orders and he would have noticed the
said clerical errors before signing the <span style="">decision.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hamada recalled that, as correctly stated in Judge <span class="SpellE">Benaventura's</span> decision, there was <span style="">an </span>ocular inspection of the lots sought to be registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge, the fiscal and <span style="">Hamada motored to <span class="SpellE">Beckel</span>
where the lands were located.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Asked to comment on the testimony of Miguel O. <span class="SpellE">Dumpit</span>, the prewar interpreter in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
of Judge Carlos, that Exhibit G was the decision of the said judge in the said
land <span style="">regist</span>ration cases, Hamada
said that he did not know how Judge Carlos could have rendered a decision in
the cases which he never tried and that <span class="SpellE">Dumpit</span> was
referring to <span style="">a </span><span style="">nonexistent </span>decision of Judge Carlos
(160 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That is not all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the alleged decision of Judge
Carlos (which does not bear the court's dry seal) reveals some discrepancies
which militate against its authenticity:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the opening statement
of the decision, it is stated <span style="">that </span><span class="SpellE">Magsia</span>, Sergio, <span class="SpellE">Albina</span>, <span class="SpellE">Venancia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Piscong</span> and Pedro, all

is unwarranted because, as already stated<span class="GramE">,</span> <span class="SpellE">Pul<span style="">mano</span></span><span style=""> was not the sole applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His brothers and sisters were his
co-applicants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opening statement in
the decision and the title of the case were intended to sustain that <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion wherein it was erroneously assumed that
<span class="SpellE">Pulmano</span> was the sole applicant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two discrepancies are sufficient to
cast doubt on </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">authenticity of Judge Carlos' decision, ExhiÂ­bit
G. How that copy came to be </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the
possession of <span class="SpellE">Piscong</span> <span class="SpellE">Molintas</span>,
who did not testify, was never explained in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In</span>
that decision (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G), it is made to appear that
Judge Carlos cited <span class="SpellE">Susi</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Ramos and Director of Lands, <u>46
Phil. 626</u> <span style="">as authority for the
ruling that "an open, <span class="SpellE">continous</span> (sic) and
adverse possession of such land for at least from July 26, 1894, is sufficient
to confer upon the (sic) occupant effective title of ownership thereto which is
<span class="SpellE">registrable</span> (sic) under the Land Registration Act
(Chapter IV, Act 496, as amended by Act No. 2874 and Commonwealth Act No.
141)" (p. 264 or 20, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of Exhibits).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no such case in Volume 46.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is reported in Volume 46, page 626 is
the case of People vs. Sleeper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe,
the person who typed Exhibit G had in mind the case of <span class="SpellE">Susi</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> and Director of Lands, <u>48 Phil. 424</u>
which contains this finding:</p>

<blockquote>"In favor of <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Susi</span>, there is, moreover, the presumption <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span><u> et de <span class="SpellE">jure</span></u>
established in paragraph (b) of section 45 of Act No. 2874, amending Act No.
926, that all the necessary requirements for a grant by the Government were
complied with, for he has been in actual and physical possesÂ­sion, personally
and through his predecessors, of an agriculÂ­tural land of the public domain
openly, continuously, exclusively and publicly since July 26, 1894, with a
right to a certificate of title to said land under the provisions of Chapter
VIII of said Act." (<span class="GramE">on</span> p. 428).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing holding is different from what Judge Carlos stated
in his supposed decision, Exhibit G, where reference is made to "Chapter
IV, Act 496, as amended by Act No. 2874 and Commonwealth Act No.
141".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Act No. 496 or the Land
Registration Law <u>is not divided into chapters</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor did the Public Land Laws, Act No. 2874
and Commonwealth Act No. 141, amend Act No. 496.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, again, Judge
Carlos is supposed to have cited the ruling (and we quote) that "although
the Government under the provisions of <u>Act 1148</u>,<u> </u>may by
reservation decide for itself what portions of the public land shall be
considered forestry land, it can do so only where private interest have (sic)
not previously intervened (Ramos vs. Director of Lands, 39 Phil. 175)" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">G, pp. 33-34, Record on Appeal).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no such ruling in the <u>Ramos</u> case which does not
cite Act No. 1148 at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
ruling is found in the syllabus of <span class="SpellE">Ankron</span> vs.
Government of the P. I., 40 Phil. 10 which cites Act No. 1148.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Carlos is thus made to appear to be as incompetent and
reckless as the fabricator of his supposed 1941 decision, Exhibit G.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spurious character
of the alleged decision of Judge Carlos is likewise proven by another spurious
evidence of Castro which is the alleged order of Judge Carlos dated July 29,
1941 for the issuance of a decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
order makes an erroneous reference to the decision "under date of <st1:date year="1941" day="12" month="6"><u>June 12, 1941</u></st1:date>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged decision is dated <st1:date year="1941" day="17" month="6"><u>June 17, 1941</u></st1:date> (pp. 34Â­-35,
Record on Appeal; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. O).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing considerations lead to the unavoidable conclusion
that the petition for reconstitution is utterly unfounded and fraudulent, a
deception sought to be foisted on <span style="">the
courts of </span><span style="">justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Castro </span><span style="">sought to reconstitute a fictitious decision and order for the issuance
of a decree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals is
reversed and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court's decision is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against Jose Castro.</span></p>
