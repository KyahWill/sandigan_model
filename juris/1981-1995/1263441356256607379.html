				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On the basis of the report and recommendation of the Legal
Officer and the Chief of the Regulatory Division of the Department of
Agriculture, Region VIII, Tacloban City,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Regional Director Cirilo R. Balagapo, Jr., lodged a complaint against
respondent Judge Demosthenes C. Duquilla for deciding Crim. Case No. 8735<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of his court on the merits instead of merely conducting a preliminary
investigation and transmitting his resolution and the records of the case to
the Provincial Prosecutor for the filing of the appropriate Information before
the proper court as mandated by Sec. 5, Rule 112, of the Amended Rules on
Criminal Procedure.  Specifically,
respondent Judge is charged with (a) assuming jurisdiction over a case for
illegal fishing with use of explosive where the penalty imposable is twenty
(20) years to life imprisonment under Sec. 38 of P.D. 704, as amended, which
was filed with him only for the purpose of preliminary investigation; (b)
amending <i>motu proprio</i> the designation of the offense to <u><span style="">illegal fishing only</span></u><span style=""> </span>to make it fall within his
jurisdiction; (c) taking cognizance of the case; (d) arraigning the four (4)
accused; (e) allowing them to plead guilty; (f) sentencing each of them only to
a fine of P1,000.00; and, (g) upon payment, ordering their immediate
release.  Incidentally, respondent Judge
is also charged with having disregarded the rules on preliminary investigation
by refusing to turn over the record of the case after his investigation to the
Office of the Provincial Prosecutor.<i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts:  On 8 July
1993, the Chief of Police of Basey, Samar, filed before respondent Judge a
criminal complaint against Fred Roa, Philip Bandoy, Aladin Roa and Aldric Roa
for violation of Sec. 33, P.D. 704, otherwise known as the <i><span style="">Fisheries Decree of 1975</span></i><span style="">, </span>for preliminary investigation on the
following antecedents:</p>

<blockquote>On 7 July 1993, at about 4:25 oâ€™clock in the afternoon, the
"Bantay Dagat Task Force" headed by Noel O. Dapon, an agricultural
technologist of the Department of Agriculture, together with PO3 Rolando O.
Banasta, PO3 Dario A. Amante, the pumpboat operator and one helper as members
were on board a pumpboat on seaborne patrol between the islands of Bgy.
Salvacion, Panunubolon and Dio, Basey, Samar when they chanced upon Fred Roa,
Philip Bandoy, Aladin Roa and Aldric Roa catching fish with the use of
dynamite.  The members of the task force
caught up with the accused and arrested them.  They were then brought to the Basey Police Station and their pumpboat,
fishing paraphernalia and equipment were confiscated by the police and
impounded at the station.  The arresting
officers also confiscated two (2) boxes of dead fish (bolinao) found floating
around the pumpboat of the accused which were submitted for examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The complaint against the four (4) accused particularly alleges
that -</p>

<blockquote>x x x on or about the 7 of July 1993 x x x x between Bgy. Salvacion
Island, Panunubolon Island and Dio Island of San Pedro Bay, Basey, Samar <span style="">x x </span>x x the above named accused x <span style="">x x </span>x did then and there willfully,

<p class="BODY">To support the complaint, the following documents were submitted:  Scientific Examination Report, Apprehension
Report, receipts of confiscated fish, fish samples and the sworn statements of
Noel O. Dapon, PO3 Rolando O. Banasta and PO3 Dario A. Amante.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the categorical statement of Dapon that the accused
"were conducting dynamite fishing in said place" and the allegation
of the police officers that "(they) saw sprouting water upward,"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent Judge <i><span style="">motu proprio</span></i><span style=""> </span>caused the amendment of the complaint
by deleting the allegation that the accused used explosive in the commission of
the crime,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>thereby reducing the gravity of the
offense and the corresponding penalty so that the case would fall under his
jurisdiction, and then arraigned the four (4) accused who all pleaded
"Guilty" in the presence of their counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirteen (13) days from the filing of the criminal complaint, or
on 22 July 1993, respondent Judge rendered a two-page decision finding all the
accused guilty of <u>illegal fishing only</u>, not <u>illegal fishing with use
of dynamite</u>, and imposing upon each of them only a fine of P1,000.00
supposedly in accordance with Sec. 38, par. (2), subpar. (d), of P.D. 704.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
After the accused paid their fines, respondent Judge immediately ordered their
release and, despite the annulment of his decision by the Regional Trial Court,
all the accused now remain at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant submits that respondent Judge had no jurisdiction to
try and decide Crim. Case No. 8735 as it involved a violation of Sec. 38, par.
(a), subpar. (1), of P.D. 704, now Sec. 38, subsec. a (1), of P.D. 1058, a
crime punishable with imprisonment ranging from twenty (20) years to life
imprisonment,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
because under Sec. 32 of B.P. 129, Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial
Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction
over all offenses punishable with imprisonment of not exceeding four years and
two months, or a fine of not more than four thousand pesos or both such fine
and imprisonment.  According to
complainant, respondent Judge should have observed the duties of an
investigating judge, i.e., conduct the preliminary investigation, and if he
should find a <i><span style="">prima facie</span></i><span style=""> case, </span>transmit his resolution to the
Provincial Prosecutor together with the entire records for the filing of the
appropriate Information.  This he failed
to do.  To aggravate matters, respondent
Judge allowed the amendment of the original complaint without the knowledge or
consent of the complainant and then arraigned the accused on the basis thereof,
again without the knowledge or consent of the offended party or the fiscal, and
finally decided the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment, respondent Judge explained that he assumed
jurisdiction over the subject case because the joint statement executed by the
police officers who arrested the accused failed to allege the use of explosive
in the commission of the crime but only "sprouting water upward."
Hence, according to him, he treated the case as one falling under Sec. 38,
subpar. (d), of P.D. 704 which imposes the penalty of imprisonment ranging from
six (6) months to four (4) years or fine of five hundred pesos to five thousand
pesos, therefore falling within the jurisdiction of his court.  Besides, respondent Judge observed, an
Information had already been filed by the Provincial Fiscal before the Regional
Trial Court of Basey, docketed as Crim. Case No. 39-2005, on the basis of his
order dated 18 August 1993 finding <span style="">a <i>prima
facie</i> </span>case against the four (4) accused for violating P.D. 704.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the same order, respondent Judge also canceled his earlier decision dated 22
July 1993 and directed the Municipal Treasurer of Basey to return the fines
paid by the accused.  Judge Duquilla
further noted an earlier case which involved the same offense of illegal
fishing with the use of explosive committed by one Casimiro Galangue.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Judge Felix J. Dacut, predecessor of respondent Judge, decided the case on 26
November 1965 and imposed a fine of P75.00 only, yet no administrative
complaint was filed against Judge Dacut.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his memorandum dated 6 July 1994, Deputy Court Administrator
Bernardo P. Abesamis found the charges against respondent Judge sufficiently
established by the records and recommended that he be severely reprimanded for
amending <i><span style="">motu proprio</span></i><span style=""> </span>the designation of the crime and
taking cognizance of the case, with a stern warning against a repetition of the
same.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>cannot sustain
the reasoning of respondent Judge that he assumed jurisdiction over Crim. Case
No. 8735 simply because the joint sworn statement of the two police officers
failed to allege the use of explosive in catching or gathering fish.  It is a postulate in criminal procedure that
the allegations in the complaint on the ultimate facts and the elements of the
offense determine which court has jurisdiction over the case.  In the case before us, considering the
offense charged and the concomitant penalty imposable, it is obvious that the
criminal complaint was filed with respondent Judge only for the purpose of
preliminary investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> The
case therefore was beyond his jurisdiction to try on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">A cursory reading of the complaint filed by the Chief of Police
would readily show that it was sufficient in form and substance to enable
respondent Judge to know the nature of the offense charged.  Couched in ordinary and concise language,
the complaint recounted the acts complained of as those constituting the
offense of illegal fishing with the use of explosive.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Even assuming that the two police officers failed to state the use of explosive
in their joint sworn statement, the supporting documents submitted together
with the complaint, particularly the sworn statement of Noel O. Dapon who was
the leader of the arresting team, were clear on the nature of the crime, i.e.,
illegal fishing with the use of explosive.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is gross ignorance of the law for respondent Judge to
amend <i>motu proprio</i> the complaint by canceling the phrase "with the
use of explosive, which they possessed and carried without permit or license
from competent authorities," and considering the accused as having committed
a light offense, proceeded with their arraignment and decided the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power to amend a complaint at any time before the accused
pleads, both in form and in substance, without leave of court, is lodged in the
prosecuting officer and not in the trial judge.  In <b><span style="">Bais v. Tugaoen</span></b><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>we held -</p>

<blockquote>x x x x The contention of respondent judge
that he had the right to amend the designation of the crime in a preliminary
investigation which is not the trial proper is untenable.  The purpose of preliminary investigation is
primarily to determine whether there is a reasonable ground to believe that an
offense has been committed and the accused is probably guilty thereof, so that
a warrant of arrest may be issued and the accused held for trial.  It is not within the purview of the
preliminary investigation to give the judge the right to amend <i><span style="">motu proprio</span></i><span style=""> </span>the designation of the crime.  When the crime comes within his jurisdiction, he shall try the case, and
only after trial may he convict for a lesser offense.  In a case coming within the original jurisdiction of the Court of
First Instance, he should elevate the case as it is, even if in his opinion the
crime is less than that charged.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When a Municipal Judge conducts preliminary investigation he
performs a non-judicial function, as an exception to his usual duties.  The assignment of such executive function to
the Municipal Judge under Rule 112 of the Rules of Court is dictated by
necessity and practical considerations.  Consequently, the findings of an investigating Judge are subject to
review by the Provincial Fiscal whose findings in turn may also be reviewed by
the Secretary of Justice in appropriate cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, an investigating judge, after conducting a preliminary investigation,
shall perform his ministerial duty which is to transmit within ten (10) days
after the conclusion thereof the resolution of the case together with the
entire records to the Provincial Prosecutor,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
regardless of his belief or opinion that the crime committed, after conducting
the preliminary investigation, falls within the original jurisdiction of his
court.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
As held in <b><span style="">Daplas v. Arquiza</span></b><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>while an investigating Judge may be
excused for occasional mistakes or errors of judgment, particularly when
incurred in fine and complex points of law, or mitigated by the difficulty of
keeping abreast with this Court's ever-increasing decisions, judges are
expected to show more than cursory acquaintance with the elementary rules
governing procedure as well as settled authoritative doctrines.</p>

<p class="BODY">More than just a dereliction of his sworn duty to follow and
comply with the procedural rules in conducting preliminary investigations,
respondent Judge has committed a falsehood in his vain attempt to defend
himself and cover up for his offense.  When asked to explain the charges against him, respondent Judge stated
that in the joint sworn statement of PO3 Banasta and PO3 Amante of 8 July 1993,
particularly pars. 2, 3, 4 and 5, the use of dynamite was not alleged but only
"illegal fishing and with sprouting water upward."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Quite obviously, this is far from the truth, for in par. 7 of the same joint
sworn statement, the investigating officer, PO2 Mario Bajen, propounded on the
two (2) affiants the following question:  "What about the fish, (were) you able to confiscate from them <b><u>dynamited
fish</u></b> then?" and the answer was, "<b><u>Yes sir</u>,</b> kept
in the styrofoam, while the other fishes were on the fishnet known as <i><span style="">sibot</span></i><span style="">." </span>The actuations of respondent Judge in misrepresenting to
this Court that the complaining witnesses failed to allege in their sworn
statement that the accused had used explosive in their illegal fishing
constitute gross dishonesty and serious misconduct.  This Court condemns such conduct, especially coming from a judge who
should be an example of integrity, honesty and competence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge would seem to insinuate in his Comment that the
complainant was ill-motivated in bringing this matter to this Court because he
did not file an administrative complaint against Judge Felix J. Dacut who
likewise allegedly imposed only a fine of P75.00 on an accused after finding
him guilty of illegal fishing with the use of dynamite.  Judge Duquilla's revelation, if indeed true,
only confirms the seriousness of the situation prevailing in that area -
blatant violations of the <i><span style="">Fisheries
Decree </span></i><i><span style="">of 1975</span></i><span style=""> </span>by fishermen who when arrested and
charged are only fined and immediately released after paying the fine.  This results in the culprits avoiding
prosecution for their criminal acts as what happened in the instant case where
all the accused are now at large,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> thus
making a mockery of our laws and the criminal justice system in our country.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for failure to perform a ministerial duty,
