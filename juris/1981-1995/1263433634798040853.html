Philippines, herein referred to as the company as the bargaining agent of the
hourly paid employees working at its plant in Barrio Sucat, Muntinglupa, Rizal,

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 2.5in; text-indent: 0in;">12</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">To implement the 1980-1983 CBA, petitioner
used the following formula:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin: 0.1in 0in 0.0001pt 1.5in; text-indent: 0.5in;">Annual Gross  Applicable</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top: 0in;">Daily Vacation Pay = <u>  Earnings  x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Percentage<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 2in; text-indent: 0in;">  No. of Vacation Leave Days</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that under the foregoing formula, the number of
vacation leave days used as a divisor would necessarily vary depending upon the
employee's length of service, unlike in the prior CBA where 12 was a constant
divisor, representing as it did the first two weeks of vacation leave to be
commuted at a uniform rate of 4% of the employee's annual gross earnings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The core of respondent Union's position in the proceedings below
is that the "revised formula is impractical and disadvantageous to the
employees because the longer their service to the Company, even with the increased
percentage of calculation, their respective daily cash equivalent for vacation
leave are whittled down because the divisor becomes bigger."</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 30, 1981, the parties agreed to submit their dispute
regarding the computation of vacation leave pay of the employees of petitioner
under their collective bargaining agreement (CBA) to voluntary arbitration,
pursuant to the Labor Code and the provisions of said CBA requiring such mode
of disposition of all matters involving the interpretation of the CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 14, 1981, public respondent Zapanta issued said
Resolution directing petitioner "to continue with the practice of using 12
as a divisor in computing the daily vacation pay.”<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 7, 1981, petitioner filed a Motion for Partial
Reconsideration dated August 15, 1981, of the above-mentioned Resolution but
the same was denied for lack of merit by public respondent Zapanta on September
25, 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 16, 1981, the petitioner filed an appeal of the
September 25, 1981 Order which was opposed by the private respondent union on
November 3, 1981 on the ground that the Resolution in question had already
become final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding private respondent union's argument well-taken, the
public respondent dismissed the appeal in a decision rendered June 23,
1983.  Petitioner's motion for
reconsideration filed August 4, 1983, was denied for lack of merit on June 17,
1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition where petitioner claims that the public
respondents acted with grave abuse of discretion and/or excess of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">jurisdiction in that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.  The public respondents
imposed upon petitioner a formula in the commutation of vacation leave which is
clearly contrary to the intention of the parties unequivocally expressed in
petitioner's CBA with private respondent; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2.  The respondent
voluntary arbitrator exceeded his arbitration powers in altering the terms of
the CBA between petitioner and private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">We vote to dismiss the petition.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of <i>Italian Village Restaurant and/or Andrew
Ng vs. National Labor Relations Commission and Felicisimo D. Evangelista</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">this </span>Court reiterated the
well-settled doctrine that appeal within the reglementary period from the
decision being questioned is jurisdictional as these mandatory periods are
imposed to prevent needless delays and to ensure the orderly and speedy
discharge of judicial business.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the guidance of the bench and bar, We take this opportunity
to state that this Court will continue to be very strict regarding appeal’s
filed outside the reglementary periods for filing the same, specially with
respect to labor cases where:</p>

<blockquote>To extend the period of the appeal is to delay the case, a
circumstance which could give the employer the chance to wear out the efforts
and meager resources of the worker that the latter is constrained to give up
for less than what is due him.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We quote with approval the public respondent NLRC's finding of
fact on the failure of petitioner to timely appeal the questioned resolution of
the public respondent voluntary arbitrator - which finding of fact <span style="">is </span>binding on Us - thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Evident from the record is the succinct fact that the Company
did not appeal from the Resolution in question.  Instead, the Company filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration
dated August 15, 1981 which was submitted to and received by the voluntary
arbitrator on September 7, 1981.  And
while the motion failed to state the date of receipt by the Company of the
questioned Resolution, there is that certification by the Postmaster of Makati
Commercial Center Post Office to the effect that Registered Letter No. 52175
(Resolution) posted on August 7, 1981 by the voluntary arbitrator, addressed to
Company General Manager, was actually delivered to and received by Dio Intalan
(Building Security Guard) on August 11, 1981.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"As </span>aptly
observed by the union, the Company must have received a copy of the said
Resolution before August 15, 1981, date of its Motion for Partial
Reconsideration.  We noted that from
August 15, 1981 to September 7, 1981, date of filing of motion, twenty?three
(23) days (or sixteen (16) working days] had already elapsed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, even if We treat the aforesaid motion as an appeal,
as the Company pretended, We hold that the same was filed beyond the
reglementary period set forth under Section 5, Rule XI, Book V of the Code's
implementing rules and regulations.  We
cannot, for such reason, entertain such an appeal.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As further explained by the Solicitor General:<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 7pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It should be stressed that for reason only known to
petitioner, the date of receipt by petitioner or its counsel, of the
aforementioned Resolution, has not been mentioned in petitioner's Motion For
Partial Reconsideration dated August 15, 1981 and also in petitioner's basic
petition and in its Reply dated January 5, 1987 to public respondents’ Comment
dated December 9, 1986.  Whether such
actuation of petitioner was by design or not, public respondents have no way of
knowing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In any event, petitioner did not appeal public respondent
voluntary arbitrator's Resolution dated July 14, 1981 (Annex 'A', Petition) within
the reglementary period of ten (10) days from receipt thereof, to public
respondent NLRC.  What petitioner did
was to file a Motion For Partial Reconsideration dated August 15, 1981, which
was received on September 7, 1981 by public respondent voluntary
arbitrator.  During the interim, that
is, from August 15, 1981 to September 7, 1981, twenty three (23) days had
already elapsed.  It is, therefore,
indubitably clear that at the time when petitioner filed its Motion For Partial
Reconsideration dated August 15, 1981 the reglementary period of ten (10) days
for perfecting an appeal from public respondent voluntary arbitrator's
Resolution dated July 14, 1981 had long expired.  For this compelling reason, even if it is assumed that
petitioner's aforesaid Motion For partial Reconsideration dated August 15, 1981
could be treated as an appeal from public respondent voluntary arbitrator's
Resolution dated July 14, 1981, the appeal, just the same, could not have been
entertained, as it was obviously filed beyond the ten-day reglementary period
provided for in Section 5, Rule XI, Book V of the Rules and Regulations
implementing the Labor Code."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But even if petitioner had appealed on time,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> there
is no factual basis for reversing public respondent Voluntary Arbitrator's
Resolution, for contrary to the claim of petitioner that in imposing upon
petitioner the voluntary arbitrator's perception of what the CBA should
provide, notwithstanding its clear language, said voluntary arbitrator gravely
exceeded his jurisdiction, public respondent NLRC found out that:</p>

<blockquote>"Even if We lean backwards and assume the unassumable - that
there is perfected appeal - still, a review of the record, issues and arguments
fail to disclose any imperious cause for Us to disquiet the Resolution sought
to be traversed.  The voluntary
arbitrator's Order of September 25, 1981, which denied the Company's motion,
appraised the facts as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'From the said Motion and the arguments advanced by respondent, we
cannot find any substantial additional arguments for us to reconsider the <span style="">Resolution subject of this motion.  </span><i>It is admitted by the parties that
the old and the new CBA both fail </i><i><span style="">to
</span>provide the divisor in computing the daily vacation pay of the employees</i>.  Respondent assumes that by the increase of
the annual gross earnings, there should be a corresponding change of the
divisor, while the union believes that there should be no such change in the
absence of any provision in the CBA, for the use of 12 as divisor has been a
practice or policy of the respondent.  As between two assumptions, the one that is in keeping with the practice
or policy should prevail over the one against it.  This being so, we cannot find our way clear in reconsidering the
subject resolution.'  (Underscoring
supplied)<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If, as petitioner claims, the 1980-1983 CBA was written in a
"clear Language" then this case would never have reached Us at
all.  The very existence of this
petition is testimony to the ambiguity involved as to the continued use of the
divisor 12 in computing the daily vacation pay of petitioner's employees.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in a last-ditch attempt to persuade Us that the new
CBA (1980-1983) will mean more benefits for private respondent union - even
without the divisor 12, summarized in tabular form the cash benefits to be
received by them.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A clearer picture, however, will emerge if the cash benefits to
be received by private respondent union using the divisor 12 will be tabulated
alongside petitioner's tabulation, which clearer picture, assuming gross
earnings of P36, 000.00 p.a., follows:</p>

whom they were directed and who reasonably relied thereon.  The doctrine of estoppel springs from
equitable principles and the equities in the case.  It is designed to aid the law in the administration of justice
where without its aid injustice might result.   It has been applied by this Court wherever and whenever the
special circumstances of a case so demands." (<i>Philippine National Bank
