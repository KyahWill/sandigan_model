				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>, the
interpretation by the Department of Justice of the penal provision of PD 115,
the Trust Receipts Law, is assailed by petitioner.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">23 </span>January 1981,
Philippine Blooming Mills (PBM, for short) thru its duly authorized officer,
private respondent Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>, applied for the
issuance of commercial letters of credit with petitioner's <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
branch to finance the purchase of 500 M/T <span class="SpellE">Magtar</span>
Branch Dolomites and one (1) Lot High Fired Refractory Sliding Nozzle Bricks.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner issued an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of <span class="SpellE">Nikko</span> Industry Co., Ltd. (<span class="SpellE">Nikko</span>)
by virtue of which the latter drew four (4) drafts which were accepted by PBM
and duly honored and paid by the petitioner bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">To secure payment of the amount covered by the drafts, and in
consideration of the transfer by petitioner of the possession of the goods to
PBM, the latter as <span class="SpellE">entrustee</span>, thru private
respondent, executed four (4) Trust Receipt Agreements with maturity dates on
19 May, 3 and 24 June 1981 acknowledging petitioner's ownership of the goods
and its (PBM'S) obligation to turn over the proceeds of the sale of the goods,
if sold, or to return the same, if unsold within the stated period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Out of the said obligation resulted an overdue amount of
P1,475,274.09.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite repeated demands,
<span style="">PBM </span>failed and refused to either
turn over the proceeds of the sale of the goods or to return the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="9">7 September 1984</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a criminal complaint against private respondent for violation
of PD 115 before the office of the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After preliminary investigation wherein
private respondent failed to appear or submit a counter-affidavit and even
refused to receive the subpoena, the Fiscal found <span style="">a </span><u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case for
violation of PD 115 on four (4) counts and filed the corresponding information
in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent appealed the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal’s</span>
resolution to the Department of Justice on three (3) grounds:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lack of proper
preliminary investigation;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> did not have jurisdiction over the case, as
respondent's obligation was purely civil;</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There had been a <span class="SpellE">novation</span> of the obligation by the substitution of the
person of the Rehabilitation Receivers in place of both PBM and private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Then Secretary of Justice (now Senator) <span class="SpellE">Neptali</span>

<blockquote>"Your contention that respondent's
obligation was purely a civil one, is without any merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four (4) Trust Receipt Agreements entered
into by respondent and complainant appear regular in form and in
substance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their agreement regarding
interest, not being contrary to law, public policy or morals, public order or
good custom, is a valid stipulation which does not change the character of the
said Trust Receipt Agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further,
as precisely pointed out by complainant, raw materials for manufacture of goods
to be ultimately sold are proper objects of a trust receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, respondent's failure to remit to the complainant
proceeds of the sale of the finished products if sold or the finished products
themselves if not sold, at the maturity dates of the trust receipts,
constitutes a violation of P.D. 115."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration alleged that, <span style="">as </span>PBM was under rehabilitation
receivership, no criminal liability can be imputed to herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="3">17 March 1987</st1:date>, Undersecretary
Silvestre H. <span class="SpellE">Bello</span> III denied said motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The<span style=""> </span>pertinent
portion of the denial resolution states:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It cannot be denied that the
offense was consummated long before the appointment of rehabilitation
receivers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of a criminal case
against respondent <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> is not only for the purpose
of effectuating a collection of <span style="">a </span>debt
but primarily for the purpose of punishing an offender for a crime committed
not only against the complaining witness but also against the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
<span style="">for </span>violation of the Trust
Receipts Law is a special offense or <span class="SpellE"><u>mala</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>prohi­bita</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a fundamental rule in criminal law that when the crime is punished
by <span style="">a </span>special law, the act
alone, irrespective of its motives, constitutes the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case the failure of the <span class="SpellE">entrustee</span> to pay complainant the remaining balance of the
value of the goods covered by the trust receipt when the same became due
constitutes the offense penalized under Section 13 of P.D. No. 115; and on the
basis of this failure alone, the prosecution has sufficient evidence to
establish a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case (Res. No. 671, s. 1981; Allied
Banking Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Reinhard</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagemuller</span>,
et al., Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, September 18,
1981).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Likewise untenable is your
contention that ‘rehabilitation proceedings must stay the attempt to enforce a
liability in view of Section 4 of P.D. No. 1758.’ Section 4 of P.D. No. 1758,
provides, among others:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Provided, further, that upon
appointment of a management committee, rehabilitation receiver, board or body,
pursuant to this Decree, all actions for claims against corporations,
partnerships or associations under management or receivership pending before
any court, tribunal, board or body shall be suspended accordingly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"You <span style="">will </span>note that the term ‘all actions for claims’ refer only to
actions for money claims but not to criminal liability of offenders."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Another motion for reconsideration was filed by respondent on <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="4">9 April 1987</st1:date> to which an opposition
was filed by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent also filed a supplemental request for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="12"><span style="">28 </span>December
 1987</st1:date> with two (2) additional grounds, namely:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> 3) there is no evidence on record to show that respondent
was in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">particeps</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span> </span>in
the act complained of; and 4) there could be no violation of the trust receipt
agreements because the articles imported by the corporation and subject of the
trust receipts were fungible or <span class="SpellE">consummable</span> goods and
do not form part of the steel product itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These goods were not procured to be sold in whatever state or condition
they were in or were supposed to be after the manufacturing process."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Because of private respondent’s clarification that the goods
subject of the trust receipt agreements were dolomites which were specifically
used for patching purposes over the surface of furnaces and nozzle bricks which
are insulating materials in the lower portion of the ladle which do not form
part of the steel product itself, Justice Secretary <span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span>
Ordonez, on 11 January 1988, "rectified" his predecessor's supposed
reversible error, and held:</p>

<blockquote>"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it is clear that what
the law contemplates or covers are goods which have, for their ultimate
destination, the sale thereof or if unsold, their surrender to the <span class="SpellE">entruster</span>, this whether the goods are in their original
form or in their manufactured/processed state. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Since the goods covered by the trust receipts
and subject matter of these proceedings are to be utilized in the operation of
the equipment and machineries of the corporation, they could not have been
contemplated as being covered by PD 115.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is axiomatic that penal statutes are strictly construed against the
state and liberally in favor of the accused (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>,
86 SCRA 542, People vs. <span class="SpellE">Terrado</span>, 125 SCRA 648).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means that penal statutes cannot be
enlarged or extended by intendment, impli­cation, or any equitable
consideration (People vs. Garcia, 85 Phil. 651).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, not all transactions covered by trust
receipts may be considered as trust receipt transactions defined and penalized
under PD 115.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Apparently, the trust
receipt agreements were executed as security for the payment of the
drafts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, the main transaction
was that of a loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In essence, therefore, the
relation­ship between the Bank and the corporation, consequently the respondent
herein likewise included, is that of debtor and creditor.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This time, petitioner Allied Bank filed a motion for
reconsideration of the Ordonez resolution, which was resolved by the Department
of Justice on <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="2">17 February 1988</st1:date>,
enunciating that <span style="">PD </span>115 covers
goods or components of goods which are ultimately destined for sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It concluded that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The goods subject of the instant case were shown to have

115 albeit covered by Trust<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Receipt
agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> Finally, it is noted that under the <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> vs. People (121 SCRA 655 (1983), and <span class="SpellE">Vintola</span> vs. Insular Bank Of Asia and America (150 SCRA 578
(1987) rulings, the trend in the Supreme Court appears to be to the effect that
trust receipts under PD 115 are treated as secu­rity documents for basically
loan transactions, so much so that criminal liability is virtually obliterated
and limiting liability of the accused to the civil aspect only.</blockquote>

DOJ rulings, mainly on two (2) grounds:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>public respondent is

criminally punish­able, thereby rendering a portion of said law inoperative or

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>public respondent acted
with grave abuse of discretion in holding that the goods covered by the trust

<p class="BODY">Private and public respondents both filed their comments on the
petition to which a consolidated reply was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the submission of the parties’

(b) keep said goods or proceeds thereof whether in money or whatever form,
separate and capable of identification as property of the <span class="SpellE">entruster</span>;

<p class="BODY">In an attempt to escape criminal liability, private respondent
claims PD 115 covers goods which are ultimately destined for sale and not goods

of Sec. 13 covers failure to turn over the proceeds of the sale of entrusted
goods, or to return said goods if unsold or disposed of in accordance with the
terms of the trust receipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent claims that at the time of <span class="SpellE">PBM's</span> application

hence, there was no deceit resulting in a violation of the trust receipts which
would constitute a criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, we cannot uphold this contention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The non-payment of the amount covered by a trust receipt is an act <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the <span class="SpellE">entrustee's</span>

<p class="BODY">The Court takes judicial notice of customary banking and business
practices where trust receipts are used for importation of heavy equipment,

the ambit of the provisions of PD 115 albeit covered by Trust Receipt
Agreements (17 February 1988 resolution) and that not all<span style=""> </span>transactions covered by trust receipts
