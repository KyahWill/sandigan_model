This Court has been and continues to be committed to the authoritative 
doctrine that the power to punish for contempt should be exercised on 
the preservative and not vindictive principle.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  In deciding this <em>certiorari </em>and prohibition proceeding with a plea for a mandatory preliminary injunction, we do so again.
<p>
The immediate cause that resulted in an order of arrest for contumacious conduct arose from an <em>ex-parte </em>motion
 to have respondent Judge Alejandro E. Sebastian, now retired, inhibited
 from trying a civil case in the then Court of First Instance of Davao, 
16th Judicial District, Branch VIII.  The paragraph in such motion that 
apparently gave offense follows:  "That because of certain personal acts
 or conduct displayed by the Presiding Judge in handling the above case,
 which the Defendant and her counsel deem as highly irregular, corrupt 
and a gross misconduct for a Judge to do, the undersigned counsel for 
Defendant has already filed an Administrative Case against the herein 
Presiding Judge in the Supreme Court, now docketed therein as 
'Administrative Matter No. 846-CFI, Atty. Amado S. Ceniza vs. District 
Judge Alejandro Sebastian, CFI, Br. VIII, Tagum, DN', and the Defendant 
in the above case is one of the material witnesses for the complainant 
in said Adminis­trative Case; and, that by virtue of these, the bias and
 prejudice of the Presiding Judge against the Defendant and her counsel 
in the above case, is intensified and heightened, and consequently the 
Presiding Judge in the above case, will no longer have that sense of 
justice, that equanimity of emotion, that detached and unaffected 
feeling and that disinterested and impartial comportment which all 
judges ought to have and maintain while hearing and deciding a case 
before them."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
As a result, according to the Petition, "respondent Judge herein issued a
 'Warrant for the Arrest' of the petitioner herein, so that he will be 
locked-up in jail for having committed, according to said respondent 
Judge, 'Direct Contempt'."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
 It was further alleged that copies of such warrants of arrest of 
petitioner "are now in the hands of several Peace Officers, who are 
specifically ordered to arrest the herein petitioner wherever found."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  Then the Petition went on to state:  "That firmly believing that these
 warrants for his arrest issued by the herein Respondent Judge is 
grossly unlawful and is inspired by the Respondent Judge's desire for 
vengeance, hatred and yearning to persecute and destroy the herein 
Petitioner, the latter had fled from his office and resi­dence at 
Visayan Village, Tagum, Davao, and dodged arrest by hurriedly and 
secretly going to various places and ultimately here in Manila, in order
 to have the chance of filing this Petition for <em>Certiorari </em>and Prohibition with a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  After reiterating what for him was the patent illegality of such order
 for contempt and the warrant of arrest issued in pursuance thereof thus
 amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction or at the very least grave 
abuse of discre­tion, petitioner prays that there be an immediate 
prohi­bition for their enforcement, even prior to declaring them null 
and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Court required respondent to file a comment and issued a temporary 
restraining order enjoining the enforcement of such warrant of arrest.
</p><p>
Respondent Judge, accordingly, submitted his Comment to the petition.  
There was a clear admission in such comment that it was the allegation 
in paragraph 6 of the <em>Ex-Parte </em>Motion to Have Presiding Judge 
Inhibit Himself from Trying the Case which led to the issuance of the 
warrant of arrest, petitioner being guilty of direct contempt.  Thus:  
"For calling the respondent 'corrupt' in said motion, the Court issued 
an Order dated December 20, 1974 holding petitioner guilty of direct 
contempt and sentenced him to 10 days imprisonment and P200 fine.  To 
enforce the Order, a warrant for the arrest of Atty. Amado Ceniza was 
issued on December 23, 1974.  He could not be arrested, however, because
 he went into hiding.  It is this unserved warrant of arrest and the 
unexecuted Order holding him guilty of contempt that he questions in 
this special civil action of <em>Certiorari </em>and Prohibition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  For respondent Judge, the punishment for contempt being inherent in 
all courts, the only question is whether or not he had committed a grave
 abuse of discretion.  That accusation he denied in these words:  "He 
merely exercised his right and power to punish the petitioner for his 
act or conduct that tended to bring the authority of the Court and the 
administration of justice into disrepute."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  He referred to the well-settled doctrines that the use in pleadings of
 language disrespectful to the court or con­taining offensive words 
constitutes direct contempt, amounting as it does to misbehaviour in the
 presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the 
administration of justice.  He stressed the point further in this way:  
"In the instant case, the Court held Atty. Ceniza guilty of direct 
contempt for stating in his motion for the judge's inhibition, among 
others, that he was 'corrupt'.  No self-respecting judge will tolerate 
such a vile language in a lawyer's pleading; and punishing such a 
presumptuous and insolent lawyer can never be termed abuse of power or 
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction correctible by <em>certiorari </em>or
 prohibition.  Under Rule 71 of the Revised Rules of Court, contempt 
includes 'disrespect toward the court or judge.' Mr. Ceniza was plainly 
guilty of direct contempt."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p><p>
This Court, on the above facts, sustains respondent Judge in finding 
that there was a direct contempt committed but likewise holds that, 
conformably to the controlling doctrine that the power to punish for 
contempt should be exercised on the preservative and not vindictive 
principle, modifies the judgment by lifting the warrant of arrest but 
increasing the fine imposed to P500.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.      This Court from Carag v. Warden of the Jail of Cagayan,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  a 1929 decision, to Sulit v. Tiangco,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  has consistently ruled that the contempt power may be availed of by a 
judge, who is the victim of insulting and offensive epithets.  A member 
of the bar as an officer of the court is not justified to use vile and 
disrespectful language.  If there be such a failing on his part, he 
cannot complain if he is adjudged guilty of contempt.  Where the words 
appear in a pleading submitted to the Court, that is contempt in <em>facie curiae </em>and thereore may be dealt with in a summary manner. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 2.      There are circumstances however that militate in this case
 against the imposition of imprisonment for ten days.  In the comment 
submitted by respondent Judge, reference was made to an injunction 
issued by him in a civil case where the client of petitioner Ceniza was 
the defendant.  Then came this portion of such comment: "After the 
issuance of the injunction, the respondent took steps to settle the case
 amicably.  Before the break-up, the parties were quite close to the 
respondent and his wife, whom they fondly addressed as <em>tatang </em>and<em> nanang</em>.
  He succeeeded in convincing the defendant that if she no longer liked 
to live with plaintiff, who is legally married to another woman, at 
least, she should be agreeable to the division of their properties 
before they evaporated in a long litigation, eaten up by expenses and 
enormous attorney's fees.  Before the amicable settlement could be 
signed, however, the petitioner was able to dissuade the defendant from 
signing, telling her that all the real estate, businesses, trucks, and 
vehicles were hers because they were all registered in her name.  But 
the petitioner was aware that the defendant had signed a document 
wherein the properties that were to be her share were listed, as 
'agreed' upon between her and the plaintiff.  To avoid the effect of 
this document, the petitioner concocted a false story in the Answer that
 he prepared and filed that the defendant was forced to sign the 
document thru intimidation of being killed and her honor exposed by the 
plaintiff, in the residence of the respondent and with the aid of one 
Col. Callejo and the respondent.  For this shameless fabrication, 
derogatory to the integrity and honor of respondent, the petitioner and 
his client were held guilty of direct contempt of Court and sentenced to
 10 days imprisonment and P200 fine."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  Then it was stated that after petitioner was released from prison, an administrative case was filed against respondent Judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> That led to the <em>ex-parte </em>motion
 for inhibi­tion where the contemptuous language appeared.  It thus 
appears that because of the deep-seated ill-will that existed between 
petitioner and respondent Judge - a fact made manifest by their 
voluminous pleadings - it would be most difficult for respondent Judge 
to act with restraint and judiciousness.  The power to punish for 
contempt could then be a manifestation of whim, caprice, or 
arbitrariness, or something analogous to it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
  Here, while the words were contumacious, it is hard to resist the 
conclusion, considering the background of this occurrence that 
respondent Judge in imposing the ten-day sentence was not duly mindful 
of the exacting standard that preservation of the dignity of his office 
not indulging his sense of grievance sets the limits of the authority he
 is entitled to exercise.  It is the view of the Court that under the 
circumstances the fine imposed should be increased to P500.00.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, <em>certiorari </em>is granted declaring null and void the 
ten-day sentence and quashing the warrant of arrest.  Respondent Judge, 
or whoever acts in his stead, is prohibited from enforcing such order.  
The temporary restraining order is made permanent as regards the 
imposition of the ten-day imprisonment and the serving of the warrant of
 arrest.  The fine imposed should be increased to P500.00.  No costs.

<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, Escolin, </em>and <em>Cuevas, JJ., c</em>oncur.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, J.</em>, concurs and thinks no fine should be imposed.  
Petitioner already served 10 days’ imprisonment  due to a prior contempt
 order of Judge Sebastian. The charges filed by Judge Sebastian was 
dismissed.

<em>Makasiar, J.</em>, did not take part.
