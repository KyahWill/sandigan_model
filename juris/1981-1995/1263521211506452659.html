In this Petition for Review on Certiorari, petitioner, the Manila Wine 
Merchants, Inc., disputes the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals 
ordering it (petitioner) to pay respondent, the Commissioner of Internal
 Revenue, the amount of P86,804.38 as 25% surtax plus interest which 
represents the additional tax due petitioner for improperly accumulating
 profits or surplus in the taxable year 1957 under Sec. 25 of the 
National Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
The Court of Tax Appeals made the following finding of facts, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Petitioner, a domestic corporation organized in 1937, is 
principally engaged in the importation and sale of whisky, wines, 
liquors and distilled spirits.  Its original subscribed and paid capital
 was P500,000.00.  Its capital of P500,000.00 was reduced to P250,000.00
 in 1950 with the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission but
 the reduction of the capital was never implemented.  On June 21, 1958, 
petitioner's capital was increased to P1,000,000.00 with the approval of
 the said Commission. </p>
  <p>
    On December 31, 1957, herein respondent caused the examination of 
herein petitioner's book of account and found the latter of having 
unreasonably accumulated surplus of P428,934.32 for the calendar year 
1947 to 1957, in excess of the reasonable needs of the business subject 
to the 25% surtax imposed by Section 25 of the Tax Code.
  </p>
  <p>
    On February 26, 1963, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue demanded 
upon the Manila Wine Merchants, Inc. payment of P126,536.12 as 25% 
surtax and interest on the latter's unreasonable accumulation of profits
 and surplus for the year 1957, computed as follows:

  </tbody></table>
  </blockquote>
<p>Respondent contends that petitioner has accumulated earnings beyond 
the reasonable needs of its business because the average ratio of the 
cash dividends declared and paid by petitioner from 1947 to 1957 was 
40.33% of the total surplus available for distribution at the end of 
each calendar year.  On the other hand, petitioner contends that in 
1957, it distributed 100% of its net earnings after income tax and part 
of the surplus for prior years.  Respondent further submits that the 
accumulated earnings tax should be based on 25% of the total surplus 
available at the end of each calendar year while petitioner maintains 
that the 25% surtax is imposed on the total surplus or net income for 
the year after deducting therefrom the income tax due.</p>
<p>
The records show the following analysis of petitioner's net income, cash
 dividends and earned surplus for the years 1946 to 1957:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>

<p>Another basis of respondent in assessing petitioner for accumulated

unrelated business.  These investments are itemized as follows:

<p>As to the investment of P27,501.00 made by petitioner in the Acme 
Commercial Co., Inc., Mr. N.R.E. Hawkins, president of the petitioner 
corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  explained as follows:

</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    'The first item consists of shares of Acme Commercial Co., Inc. 
which the Company acquired in 1947 and 1949.  In the said years, we 
thought it prudent to invest in a business which patronizes us.  As a 
supermarket, Acme Commercial Co., Inc. is one of our best customers.  
The investment has proven to be beneficial to the stockholders of this 
Company.  As an example, the Company received cash dividends in 1961 
totalling P16,875.00 which was included in its income tax return for the
 said year.'
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As to the investments of petitioner in Union Insurance Society of Canton
 and Wack Wack Golf Club in the sums of P1,145.76 and P1.00, 
respectively, the same official of the petitioner-corporation stated 
that:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 'The second and fourth items are small amounts which we believe 
would not affect this case substantially.  As regards the Union 
Insurance Society of Canton shares, this was a pre-war investment, when 
Wise &amp; Co., Inc., Manila Wine Merchants and the said insurance firm 
were common stockholders of the Wise Bldg. Co., Inc. and the three 
companies were all housed in the same building.  Union Insurance 
invested in Wise Bldg, Co., Inc. but invited Manila Wine Merchants, Inc.
 to buy a few of its shares.' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As to the U.S.A. Treasury Bonds amounting to P347,217.50, Mr. Hawkins explained as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
'With regards to the U.S.A. Treasury Bills in the amount of P347,217.50,
 in 1950, our balance sheet for the said year shows the Company had 
deposited in current account in various banks P629,403.64 which was not 
earning any interest.  We decided to utilize part of this money as 
reserve to finance our importations and to take care of future expansion
 including acquisition of a lot and the construction of our own office 
building and bottling plant.
</p><p>
At that time, we believed that a dollar reserve abroad would be useful 
to the Company in meeting immediate urgent orders of its local 
customers.  In order that the money may earn interest, the Company, on 
May 31, 1951 purchased US Treasury bills with 90-day maturity and 
earning approximately 1% interest with the face value of US$175,000.00. 
 US Treasury Bills are easily convertible into cash and for the said 
reason they may be better classified as cash rather than investments.
</p><p>
The Treasury Bills in question were held as such for many years in view 
of our expectation that the Central Bank inspite of the controls would 
allow no-dollar licenses importations.  However, since the Central Bank 
did not relax its policy with respect thereto, we decided sometime in 
1957 to hold the bills for a few more years in view of our plan to buy a
 lot and construct a building of our own.  According to the lease 
agreement over the building formerly occupied by us in DasmariÃ±as St., 
the lease was to expire sometime in 1957.  At that time, the Company was
 not yet qualified to own real property in the Philippines.  We 
therefore waited until 60% of the stocks of the Company would be owned 
by Filipino citizens before making definite plans.  Then in 1959 when 
the Company was already more than 60% Filipino owned, we commenced 
looking for a suitable location and then finally in 1961, we bought the 
main lot with an old building on Otis St., Paco, our present site, for 
P665,000.00.  Adjoining smaller lots were bought later.  After the 
purchase of the main property, we proceeded with the remodelling of the 
old building and the construction of additions, which were completed at a
 cost of P143,896.00 in April, 1962.
</p><p>
In view of the needs of the business of this Company and the purchase of
 the Otis lots and the construction of the improvements thereon, most of
 its available funds including the Treasury Bills had been utilized, but
 inspite of the said expenses the Company consistently declared 
dividends to its stockholders.  The Treasury Bills were liquidated on 
February 15,1962.'
</p><blockquote>
  <p> Respondent found that the accumulated surplus in question were 
invested to 'unrelated business' which were not considered in the 
'immediate needs' of the Company such that the 25% surtax be imposed 
therefrom."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner appealed to the Court of Tax Appeals.
</p><p>
On the basis of the tabulated figures, supra, the Court of Tax Appeals 
found that the average percentage of cash dividends distributed was 
85.77% for a period of 11 years from 1946 to 1957 and not only 40.33% of
 the total surplus available for distribution at the end of each 
calendar year actually distributed by the petitioner to its 
stockholders, which is indicative of the view that the Manila Wine 
Merchants, Inc. was not formed for the purpose of preventing the 
imposition of income tax upon its shareholders.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
With regards to the alleged substantial investment of surplus or profits
 in unrelated business, the Court of Tax Appeals held that the 
investment of petitioner with Acme, Commercial Co., Inc., Union 
Insurance Society of Canton and with the Wack Wack Golf and Country Club
 are harmless accumulation of surplus and, therefore, not subÂ­ject to 
the 25% surtax provided in Section 25 of the Tax Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
As to the U.S.A. Treasury Bonds amounting to P347,217.50, the Court of 
Tax Appeals ruled that its purchase was in no way related to 
petitioner's business of importing and selling wines, whisky, liquors 
and distilled spirits.  Respondent Court was convinced that the surplus 
of P347,217.50 which was invested in the U.S.A. Treasury Bonds was 
availed of by petitioner for the purpose of preventing the imposition of
 the surtax upon petitioner's shareholders by permitting its earnings 
and profits to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of business.  
Hence, the Court of Tax Appeals modified respondent's decision by 
imposing upon petitioner the 25% surtax for 1957 only in the amount of 
P86,804.38 computed as follows:
</p><p>
Unreasonable accumulation of surplus       P347,217.50
</p><p>
25% surtax due thereon                               P  86,804.38<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
On May 30, 1966, the Court of Tax Appeals denied the motion for 
reconsideration filed by petitioner on March 30, 1966.  Hence, this 
petition.
</p><p>
Petitioner assigns the following errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    I
  </p>
  <p>
    The Court of Tax Appeals erred in holding that petitioner was 
availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of a surtax on 
its shareholders.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    II
  </p>
  <p>
    The Court of Tax Appeals erred in holding that petitioner's purchase
 of U.S.A. Treasury Bills in 1951 was an investment in unrelated 
business subject to the 25% surtax in 1957 as surplus profits improperly
 accumulated in the latter year.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    III
  </p>
  <p> The Court of Tax Appeals erred in not finding that petitioner did 
not accumulate its surplus profits improperly in 1957, and in not 
holding that such surplus profits, including the so-called unrelated 
investments, were necessary for its reasonÂ­able business needs. </p>
  <p align="center">
    IV
  </p>
  <p>
    The Court of Tax Appeals erred in not holding that petitioner had 
overcome the prima facie presumption provided for in Section 25(c) of 
the Revenue Code.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    V
  </p>
  <p>
    The Court of Tax Appeals erred in finding petitioner liable for the 
payment of the surtax of P86,804.38 and in denying petitioner's Motion 
for Reconsideration and/or New Trial.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The issues in this case can be summarized as follows:  (1) whether the 
purchase of the U.S.A. Treasury bonds by petitioner in 1951 can be 
construed as an investment to an unrelated business and hence, such was 
availed of by petitioner for the purpose of preventing the imposition of
 the surtax upon petitioner's shareholders by permitting its earnings 
and profits to accumulate beyond the reasonable needs of the business, 
and if so, (2) whether the penalty tax of twenty-five percent (25%) can 
be imposed on such improper accumulation in 1957 despite the fact that 
the accumulation occurred in 1951.
</p><p>
The pertinent provision of the National Internal ReveÂ­nue Code reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 25.  <em>Additional tax on corporations improperly accumulating profits or surplus</em>.
 - (a) Imposition of Tax. - If any corporation, except banks, insurance 
companies, or personal holding companies whether domestic or foreign, is
 formed or availed of for the purpose of preventing the imposition of 
the tax upon its shareholders or members or the shareholders or members 
of another corporation, through the medium of permitting its gains and 
profits to accumulate instead of being divided or distributed, there is 
levied and assessed against such corporation, for each taxable year, a 
tax equal to twenty-five per centum of the undistributed portion of its 
accumulated profits or surplus which shall be in addition to the tax 
imposed by section twenty-four and shall be computed, collected and paid
 in the same manner and subject to the same provisions of law, including
 penalties, as that tax:  Provided, that no such tax shall be levied 
upon any accumulated profits or surplus, if they are invested in any 
dollar-producing or dollar-saving industry or in the purchase of bonds 
issued by the Central Bank of the Philippines. </p>
  <p align="center">

  </p>
  <p> (c)  <em>Evidence determinative of purpose</em>. - The fact that 
earnings of profits of a corporation are permitted to accumulate beyond 
the reasonable needs of the business shall be determinative of the 
purpose to avoid the tax upon its shareholders or members unless the 
corporation, by clear preponderance of evidence, shall prove the 
contrary." (As amended by Republic Act No. 1823). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As correctly pointed out by the Court of Tax Appeals, inasmuch as the 
provisions of Section 25 of the National Internal Revenue Code were 
bodily lifted from Section 102 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 
1939, including the regulations issued in connection therewith, it would
 be proper to resort to applicable cases decided by the American Federal
 Courts for guidance and enlightenment.
</p><p>
A prerequisite to the imposition of the tax has been that the 
corporation be formed or availed of for the purpose of avoiding the 
income tax (or surtax) on its shareholders, or on the shareholders of 
any other corporation by permitting the earnings and profits of the 
corporation to accumulate instead of dividing them among or distributing
 them to the shareholders.  If the earnings and profits were 
distributed, the shareholders would be required to pay an income tax 
thereon whereas, if the distribution were not made to them, they would 
incur no tax in respect to the undistributed earnings and profits of the
 corporation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  The touchstone of liability is the purpose behind the accumulation of the income and not the consequences of the accumulation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  Thus, if the failure to pay dividends is due to some other cause, such
 as the use of undistributed earnings and profits for the reasonable 
needs of the business, such purpose does not fall within the 
interdiction of the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</p><p>
An accumulation of earnings or profits (including undistributed earnings
 or profits of prior years) is unreasonable if it is not required for 
the purpose of the business, considering all the circumstances of the 
case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
In purchasing the U.S.A. Treasury Bonds, in 1951, petitioner argues that
 these bonds were so purchased (1) in order to finance their 
importation; and that a dollar reserve abroad would be useful to the 
Company in meeting urgent orders of its local customers and (2) to take 
care of future expansion including the acquisition of a lot and the 
construction of their office building and bottling plant.
</p><p>
We find no merit in the petition.
</p><p>
To avoid the twenty-five percent (25%) surtax, petitioner has to prove 
that the purchase of the U.S.A. Treasury Bonds in 1951 with a face value
 of $175,000.00 was an investment within the reasonable needs of the 
Corporation.
</p><p>
To determine the "reasonable needs" of the business in order to justify 
an accumulation of earnings, the Courts of the United States have 
invented the so-called "Immediacy Test" which construed the words 
"reasonable needs of the business" to mean the immediate needs of the 
business, and it was generally held that if the corporation did not 
prove an immediate need for the accumulation of the earnings and 
profits, the accumulation was not for the reasonable needs of the 
business, and the penalty tax would apply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  American cases likewise hold that investment of the earnings and 
profits of the corporation in stock or securities of an unrelated 
business usually indicates an accumulation beyond the reasonable needs 
of the business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
</p><p>
The finding of the Court of Tax Appeals that the purchase of the U.S.A. 
Treasury bonds were in no way related to petitioner's business of 
importing and selling wines whisky, liquors and distilled spirits, and 
thus construed as an investment beyond the reasonable needs of the 
business<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  is binding on Us, the same being factual.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
  Furthermore, the wisdom behind this finding cannot be doubted.  The 
case of J.M. Perry &amp; Co. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  supports the same.  In that case, the U.S. Court said the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It appears that the taxpayer corporation was engaged in the 
business of cold storage and warehousing in Yahima, Washington.  It 
maintained a cold storage plant, divided into four units, having a total
 capacity of 490,000 boxes of fruits.  It presented evidence to the 
effect that various alterations and repairs to its plant were 
contemplated in the tax years, x x x </p>
  <p>
  It also appeared that in spite of the fact that the taxpayer contended
 that it needed to maintain this large cash reserve on hand, it 
proceeded to make various investments which had no relation to its 
storage business.  In 1934, it purchased mining stock which it sold in 
1935 at a profit of US $47,995.29.  x x x
  </p>
  <p> All these things may reasonably have appealed to the Board as 
incompatible with a purpose to strengthen the financial position of the 
taxpayer and to provide for needed alteration."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The records further reveal that from May 1951 when petitioner purchased 
the U.S.A. Treasury shares, until 1962 when it finally liquidated the 
same, it (petitioner) never had the occasion to use the said shares in 
aiding or financing its importation.  This militates against the purpose
 enunciated earlier by petitioner that the shares were purchased to 
finance its importation business.  To justify an accumulation of 
earnings and profits for the reasonably anticipated future needs, such 
accumulation must be used within a reasonable time after the close of 
the taxable year.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
</p><p>
Petitioner advanced the argument that the U.S.A. Treasury shares were 
held for a few more years from 1957, in view of a plan to buy a lot and 
construct a building of their own; that at that time (1957), the Company
 was not yet qualified to own real property in the Philippines, hence it
 (petitioner) had to wait until sixty percent (60%) of the stocks of the
 Company would be owned by Filipino citizens before making definite 
plans.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
</p><p>
These arguments of petitioner indicate that it considers the U.S.A. 
Treasury shares not only for the purpose of aiding or financing its 
importation but likewise for the purpose of buying a lot and 
constructing a building thereon in the near future, but conditioned upon
 the completion of the 60% citizenship requirement of stock ownership of
 the Company in order to qualify it to purchase and own a lot.  The time
 when the company would be able to establish itself to meet the said 
requirement and the decision to pursue the same are dependent upon 
various future contingencies.  Whether these contingencies would unfold 
favorably to the Company and if so, whether the Company would decide 
later to utilize the U.S.A. Treasury shares according to its plan, 
remains to be seen.  From these assertions of petitioner, We cannot 
gather anything definite or certain.  This, We cannot approve.
</p><p>
In order to determine whether profits are accumulated for the reasonable
 needs of the business as to avoid the surtax upon shareholders, the 
controlling intention of the taxpayer is that which is manifested at the
 time of accumulation not subsequently declared intentions which are 
merely the product of afterthought.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
  A speculative and indefinite purpose will not suffice.  The mere 
recognition of a future problem and the discussion of possible and 
alternative solutions is not sufficient.  Definiteness of plan coupled 
with action taken towards its consummation are essential.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Court of Tax Appeals correctly made the following ruling:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "As to the statement of Mr. Hawkins in Exh. "B" regarding the 
expansion program of the petitioner by purchasing a lot and building of 
its own, we find no justifiable reason for the retention in 1957 or 
thereafter of the US Treasury Bonds which were purchased in 1951. </p>

</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Moreover, if there was any thought for the purchase of a lot and 
building for the needs of petitioner's business, the corporation may not
 with impunity permit its earnings to pile up merely because at some 
future time certain outlays would have to be made.  Profits may only be 
accumulated for the reasonable needs of the business, and implicit in 
this is further requirement of a reasonable time."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Viewed on the foregoing analysis and tested under the "immediacy 
doctrine," We are convinced that the Court of Tax Appeals is correct in 
finding that the investment made by petitioner in the U.S.A. Treasury 
shares in 1951 was an accumulation of profits in excess of the 
reasonable needs of petitioner's business.
</p><p>
Finally, petitioner asserts that the surplus profits allegedly 
accumulated in the form of U.S.A. Treasury shares in 1951 by it 
(petitioner) should not be subject to the surtax in 1957.  In other 
words, petitioner claims that the surtax of 25% should be based on the 
surplus accumulated in 1951 and not in 1957.
</p><p>
This is devoid of merit.
</p><p>
The rule is now settled in Our jurisprudence that undistributed earnings
 or profits of prior years are taken into consideration in determining 
unreasonable accumulation for purposes of the 25% surtax.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  The case of Basilan Estates, Inc. vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  further strengthens this rule, and We quote:
</p><p>
"Petitioner questions why the examiner covered the period from 1948-1953
 when the taxable year on review was 1953.  The surplus of P347,507.01 
was taken by the examiner from the balance sheet of the petitioner for 
1953.  To check the figure arrived at, the examiner traced the 
accumulation process from 1947 until 1953, and petitioner's figure stood
 out to be correct.  There was no error in the process applied, for 
previous accumulations should be considered in determining unreasonable 
accumulation for the year concerned.  'In determining whether 
accumulations of earnings or profits in a particular year are within the
 reasonable needs of a corporation, it is necessary to take into account
 prior accumulations, since accumulations prior to the year involved may
 have been sufficient to cover the business needs and additional 
accumulations during the year involved would not reasonably be 
necessary.'"
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision of the Court of Tax 
Appeals is AFFIRMED <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span>, with costs against petitioner.
SO ORDERED.
