incorporated and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as
"<span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Trading Incorporated" with an
authorized capital stock of P100,000, P20,000 of which had been subscribed and

Rogelio Santos, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> Robles.</p>

<p class="BODY">The common defense of all the accused was as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The acquisition of the electrical items was an emergency measure
necessitated by the brownout at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mactan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place> on the night of <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incoming flights had to be diverted as the
runway and taxiway lights necessary for a proper landing were all out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jesus <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, CAA
Director, directed <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> officials to implement a
plan to install commercial power at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mactan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>
which at that time depended on the <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> Electric
Company and the Philippine Air Force for its power source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, Cash Disbursement Ceilings
(CDC) in the total amount of P310,000.00 were released.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the <span class="SpellE">CDCs</span> would expire on <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1975</st1:date>, it was necessary to
make it appear in the vouchers, supporting documents, reports of inspection,
and certificates of delivery that the items requisitioned were delivered and
inspected on or before <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">CDCs</span> had to be
utilized before the end of the fiscal year as otherwise they would revert to
the general fund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the
emergency nature of the purchase, there was no time to advertise and the
Bidding Committee had to adopt the more expeditious mode of procurement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, the prices paid by the government
were reasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jimenez testified that he approved the vouchers after verifying
that all the supporting documents were in order and duly certified by the
proper officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He disclaimed
responsibility in determining the reputability of the supplier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted he knew Dario, <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> and Robles but denied that they were in his office
at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mactan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to follow up the transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Montayre</span> contended that his
participation in the transaction was limited to requisitioning the electrical
items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not a member of the
Bidding Committee and so had nothing to do with the canvassing of the prices,
the determination of the winning bidder, and the verification of reputability
of the supplier.</p>

<p class="BODY">Villa, a member of the Bidding Committee, argued that he did not
participate in the canvass of the <span class="SpellE">requistioned</span>
items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As chief of the logistics
section, it was his duty to determine the items needed for the airport but not
the availability of funds for their acquisition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He processed the vouchers before <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1975</st1:date>, because the funds
needed for the items requisitioned would not be available if not disbursed
before that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did this upon <span class="SpellE">Montayre's</span> direction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span> testified that she made a
canvass of the items requisitioned independent of the Bidding Committee, to use
as a basis for determining the reasonableness of the prices quoted by
suppliers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She acted pursuant to the
National Accounting and Auditing Rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She added that she went to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to make the canvass because there was no supplier in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
that could furnish the needed items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
had no responsibility to determine who were qualified to participate in the
bidding as she was not a member of the Bidding Committee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pre-audited and initialed the vouchers
after verifying all supporting documents and certifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also said she signed the inspection
reports ahead of the actual delivery of the items because the <span class="SpellE">CDCs</span> would expire on <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision dated July 28, 1988, the First Division of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> found all the accused guilty beyond

purchases of supplies and equipment at CAA <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span>,
regardless of the source or the reputability of the suppliers.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> observed that there
was an overcharge in the four vouchers between the prices quoted by <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> as reflected in the Abstract of Bids and the amounts
actually paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The overcharge, totaling
P27, 100, was meant to represent the cost of installation, but there was no
justification for including this item in the vouchers and no proof either that <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> undertook the installation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, this work appeared to have
been undertaken by <span class="SpellE">Montayre</span> and personnel from the
Bureau of Air Transportation.</p>

<blockquote>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> held:</blockquote>

<blockquote>From all facts and circumstances, admitted or undisputed, as well
as those inferences, deductions, and conclusions logically and reasonably
proceeding <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, We are drawn into the
conclusion that accused Arturo S. Jimenez, Rodolfo E. <span class="SpellE">Montayre</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> G. Villa, Josefina S. <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span>
and Hereto C. <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>, indeed, had conspired with <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> David, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, Fernando Dario and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span>
Robles in a dastardly scheme to defraud the government.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>When accused Jimenez, <span class="SpellE">Montayre</span>, Villa, <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> signed,
approved and/or executed the documents that facilitated the consummation of the
transaction in question, in conspiracy with David, <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>,
Dario and Robles, in direct violation of existing rules and regulations
promulgated by competent authority, they have become criminally liable under
Section 3, paragraph (a), of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They not only persuaded, induced, or
influenced each other as public officers to commit such flagrant violations,
but also allowed themselves to be so persuaded, induced or influenced to
railroad the transaction in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They had wittingly allowed the questioned purchase from <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Enterprises, an entity which is not a reputable
manufacturer or a duly registered and licensed distributor of the equipment
purchased, the same being engaged in the business only of "paper products
and printed matters."</blockquote>

<blockquote>By the questioned transaction, <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span>
Enterprises was also given unwarranted benefits, advantage, or preference, to
the exclusion of more established and/or reputable establishments manufacturing
or dealing in the kind of equipment purchased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was manifest partiality, evident bad faith, and inexcusable
negligence in accepting the bid of <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Enterprises
and approving the same within a period of only one day, in accomplishing the
purchase order and general vouchers in payment of the requisitioned equipment
within a period of one week, and delivering the corresponding warrants or
checks in payment of the same, through a<i> </i>CAA employee, even before
delivery of said equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3,
paragraph (3) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, was thereby violated.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>By combining, confederating, and conspiring with <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, Dario, and Robles to promote or facilitate efforts
that led to the violation of Section 3, paragraph (h) of Republic Act No. 3019,
for which <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, Dario, and Robles were convicted, accused
Jimenez, <span class="SpellE">Montayre</span>, Villa, <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> rendered themselves equally liable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finally, there can be<i> </i>no doubt at all that Jimenez, <span class="SpellE">Montayre</span>, Villa, <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> are liable under Section 3, paragraph (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) since they participated in or were responsible for the
approval of a manifestly unlawful, inequitable, or irregular transaction, by
which actuations interest for personal gain shall be presumed against them.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> case was
pending, the Court of Appeals, in a decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1988</st1:date>, reversed the
judgment of conviction rendered by the Circuit Criminal Court, on the ground of
insufficient evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision was

petitions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1989</st1:date>, we resolved to consolidate these
cases upon motion of the Solicitor General, who was directed to file a
Consolidated Comment on all the cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The common issues raised in these petitions are:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
decision of acquittal of the Court of Appeals promulgated 6 months before the
decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> bars their conviction
pursuant to the doctrine of "the law of the case."</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
testimonies of prosecution witnesses, which were discredited by the Court of
Appeals as biased, merit belief by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not there
was conspiracy among the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that since their cases in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> were merely an offshoot of Criminal Case No.
CCC-XIV-1457 in the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City, which was reversed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 24142, the
decision of the Court of Appeals has become the "law of the case"
which cannot now be overturned by any court and should be applied in the case
at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, they should also be
acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine has been defined as "that principle under which
determinations of questions of law will generally be held to govern a case
throughout all its subsequent stages where such determination has already been
made on a prior appeal to a court of last resort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is merely a rule of procedure and does not
go to the power of the court, and will not be adhered to where its application
will result in an unjust decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
relates entirely to questions of law, and is confined in its operation to
subsequent proceedings in the same case."</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Jarantilla</span> v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
we held:</p>

<blockquote>"Law of the case" has been defined as the opinion
delivered on a<i> </i><u>former appeal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More specifically, it means that whatever is once irrevocably
established, as the <u>controlling legal rule of<i> </i>decision</u> between
the same parties <u>in the same case</u> continues to be the law of the case,
whether correct on general principles or not, so long as the facts on which
such decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the case before the
court (21 C.J.S. 330) (Italics supplied).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It need not be stated that the Supreme Court being the court of last
resort, is the final arbiter of all legal questions properly brought before it
and that its <u>decision</u> in any given case constitutes the law of <u>that
particular case</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (Emphasis supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a rule of general application that the
decision of an appellate court in a case is the law of the case on the points
presented throughout all the subsequent proceedings in the case in both the
trial and the appellate courts, and no question necessarily involved and
decided on that appeal will be considered on a second appeal or writ of error
in the same case, provided the facts and issues are substantially the same as
those on which the first question rested and, according to some authorities,
provided the decision is on the merits.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In light of these definitions, we find that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> did not err in holding as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The decision of the Court of Appeals reversing the judgment of the
Circuit Criminal Court in Case No. CCC-XIV-1457, was not, however, a
determination of a question of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
present case is not merely a stage or subsequent proceedings of that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although related, they are entirely distinct
and separate cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in both cases,
the transaction involved, the charges laid, and the persons alluded to as
co-conspirators are one and the same there is definitely no identity of parties
between the two cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The persons
accused in one differ from those in the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is, therefore, no way whereby the doctrine of the law of the case
would apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If ever the findings of the
Court of Appeals in the case decided by it would be considered operative as the
"law of the case," the same would he confined in its operations
solely to the case and to those accused therein.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also invoke <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>, pointing out that in Criminal Case No.
CCC-XIV-1457 and the case at bar, there was identity of the transaction
involved, the witnesses and documentary evidence presented, and the offenses
charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of acquittal in CA G.R. No. 24142 does not
constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
so as to bar a judgment of conviction in Criminal Case No. 5915.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the requisites of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> is that there must be substantial
identity of parties,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
which is not present in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners claim that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
"relied very heavily, if not mainly” on and has merely adopted the
findings of facts of the Circuit Criminal Court in arriving at its judgment of
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the reversal of the
decision of the Circuit Criminal Court, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
decision has also lost its basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is also unacceptable.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> did consider
the decision of the Circuit Criminal Court in finding the petitioners guilty,
this was not the sole reason for their conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the conclusions of that court, the
<span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> made its own findings of fact based on
the testimony of witnesses and documentary evidence submitted to it during the
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the major part of its
decision dwelt on its own analysis of such evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also invoke the decision of the Court of Appeals
rejecting the charge of conspiracy and contend that its finding that David, <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, Dario and Robles did not conspire among themselves
or with the herein petitioners precluded the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
from arriving at a contrary conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">This defense is also untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held that although "a conspiracy is <span style="font-size: 11pt;">in
</span>its nature a joint offense . . . it does not follow that one person only
cannot be convicted of <span style="font-size: 11pt;">conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>So long as the acquittal or death of a
co-conspirator does not remove the bases for a charge of conspiracy, one
defendant may be found guilty of the offense."</p>

<p class="BODY">Notably, the judgment of acquittal of the Court of Appeals
invoked by the herein petitioners was based on the insufficiency of the
evidence of guilt of the accused therein and not on a finding that no offense
had been committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners complain that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
erred in giving credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses who had
earlier been disbelieved by the Court of Appeals as biased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer to this is that the findings of
fact of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in the cases before us are
binding on this Court in the absence of a showing that they come under the
established exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also worth
noting that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, being a trial court,
was in a position to observe the demeanor of the witnesses, unlike the Court of
Appeals which had to rely only, in the words of the Solicitor General, "on
a mute transcript of stenographic notes."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is asserted that the omission to ascertain the reputability of
the supplier would result only in administrative and not criminal liability, as
held by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not
think so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only administrative but
also criminal liability under the aforementioned paragraphs (a) and (e), Section
3, of R.A. 3019 was incurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
failure to ascertain the reputability of <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span>
Enterprises constituted a violation of the rules and regulations promulgated by
competent authority and comes under paragraph (a).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The manifest partiality that resulted in
unwarranted benefits to <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> was in contravention of
paragraph (e).</p>

<p class="BODY">Also invoked is our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Bayot</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

<blockquote>Petitioner herein, Reynaldo R. <span class="SpellE">Bayot</span>,
together with his co-accused Lorenzo Ga. Cesar, was one of the those charged
and convicted in a joint decision by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of public
documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both were sentenced to a
total of 577 years imprisonment by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
on exactly the same evidence which this Court had pronounced as "woefully
inadequate" and "too conjectural and presumptive to establish personal
culpability." (Cesar v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 134 SCRA
105).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for review filed by
Lorenzo Ga. Cesar was granted by this Court and in the decision rendered on <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1985</st1:date> in G.R. Nos.
L-54719-50, 134 SCRA 105, the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, reversed the decision
of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and acquitted Lorenzo Ga.
Cesar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge and the evidence
submitted against Lorenzo Ga. Cesar being one and the same against the herein
petitioner Reynaldo R. <span class="SpellE">Bayot</span>, the Court should do no
less with respect to the latter.</blockquote>

it was this Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> that reversed the decision convicting
the accused of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> through falsification of public
documents because it had not been proved that Cesar signed the questioned
vouchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This served as<i> </i>the
basis for acquitting <span class="SpellE">Bayot</span> in his own petition for
review as they were<b> </b>charged under identical <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
and convicted in a<i> </i>joint decision based on the same evidence presented
before <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the first three accused were convicted by the
Circuit Criminal Court and later acquitted by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second batch of accused, the petitioners
herein, were convicted directly by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, we cannot rule on the decision of the Court of Appeals

which is the case we can review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so

been appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
confined only to the examination of the proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
because it is its decision that has been elevated to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the records of that case, to repeat, we
are satisfied that there was a conspiracy among some of the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The failure to show that the petitioners profited from the

it is the commission of that act as defined by the law, not the character or

in consonance with the announced purpose for which Republic Act 3019 was
enacted, which is the repression of certain <u>acts</u> of public officers and

<p class="BODY">The petitioners stress that the investigating fiscal who
conducted the preliminary investigation cleared them of liability (while <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> Fernandez maintained there was conspiracy) and

That case, in fact, argues against them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Quizo</span>, it was the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>
himself who moved for the dismissal of the information with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> which denied the same and which denial we set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigating fiscal being

the prosecution of petitioner in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>

review, revise or reverse the findings of the Court of Appeals in relation to
which the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, a special court with special

<p class="BODY">In that case, <span class="SpellE">Pajaro</span>, as
officer-in-charge of the Office of the City Treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
City, was charged before the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> with
violation of R.A. 3019 for having given undue advantage and benefits to a
delinquent taxpayer by allowing it to pay in installments instead of collecting
the taxes due within the period fixed in the Local Tax Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the case was pending, Llamas filed a
petition for <i><u>mandamus</u></i> to compel <span class="SpellE">Pajaro</span>
to collect the delinquent's tax liabilities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court dismissed the suit and on appeal was upheld by the Court
of Appeals on the ground that no prejudice had been caused to the city, which
in fact stood to gain more from the promissory note than the amount awarded by
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> filed the information
against <span class="SpellE">Pajaro</span> but later recommended its dismissal,
which the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citing the Court of Appeals decision, <span class="SpellE">Pajaro</span> moved for reconsideration, which the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> also denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This prompted the petition for <i><u>certiorari</u> </i>and prohibition,
where we ruled in favor of <span class="SpellE">Pajaro</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Pajaro</span> Case is not applicable
because, as correctly observed by the Solicitor General, one and the same act
of the same party was the subject of separate cases before the Court of Appeals

No. CCC-XIV-1457.</p>

where this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>At the same time, the too frequent rotation of Justices hearing

the Court of Appeals reviews and decides cases on the basis of the records and
does not conduct trials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reducing
temporary changes in its divisions to the barest minimum, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> also reduces the possibility of one Justice
who hears all the witnesses, influencing the findings of the Justices who did
not have the same opportunity.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In that case, we set aside the decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and ordered a<i> </i>new trial not solely on
the basis of the "too frequent rotation of justices" but also because
"in addition to the newly-discovered evidence, there (were) serious
allegations which call(ed) for a more thorough examination."</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, temporary vacancies in a division of a collegiate
court are to be expected and unavoidable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The "frequent rotation of justices" decried by the petitioners
was not deliberately done to prejudice them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must also be noted that there was no categorical statement in <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> that "frequent rotation of justices"
would result <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>nullity</u> of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now proceed to the liabilities of the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners submit that their acts of requisitioning the items,
approving and signing documents relative to the transaction and issuing the
checks in payment of the items requisitioned were made in good faith to beat
the expiry date of the <span class="SpellE">CDCs</span> on <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1975</st1:date>, and allow their utilization before
their reversion to the general fund.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree that the issuance of and signatures on the reports of
inspection, certificates of delivery and general vouchers, all before June 30,
1975, prior to the actual delivery of the requisitioned items, were innocent
and justified by the emergency nature of the purchase and the need to beat the
expiry dates of the <span class="SpellE">CDCs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we cannot come to terms with, however,
is the glaring fact that the winning bidder, <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span>
Enterprises, which was represented by <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, Robles
and Dario, deals only in paper products and printed matter and merely procured
the electrical items it supplied to CAA <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> from
UTESCO, one of the losing bidders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
transaction reveals that unwarranted advantage through manifest partiality were
accorded <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> notwithstanding its lack of
reputability as a supplier of electrical equipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Who and what made this possible?</p>

<p class="BODY">A close scrutiny of the circumstances of this case clearly
indicates that Jimenez and <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span> were indeed
involved in a scheme <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dario, <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> and Robles were CAA
Manila employees and were on leave during the period of the questioned
transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were seen by
prosecution witnesses at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mactan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place> in the company of Jimenez,
who admitted he knew the three.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Robles
and <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> are incorporators of <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span>
Trading, Inc., which was the <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Enterprises at the
time the transaction was consummated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was a sole proprietorship registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, wife of <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, and engaged
only in the business of dealing in "paper products and printed
matter."</p>

<p class="BODY">When the requisition of the items was made, <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span>
went to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> pursuant to a travel
order issued by Jimenez to canvass prices of the articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not explained why she delivered an
advertisement form to <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Enterprises, which was a
supplier only of paper products and printed matter but not of the needed
electrical items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Curiously, <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> submitted the lowest quotation for the items
requisitioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the contract was
awarded to it, <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> merely procured the items
requisitioned from UTESCO, a losing bidder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arturo Jimenez, Airport General Manager, had the responsibility,
as head of office, to see to it that the purchases made were from reputable
suppliers pursuant to the Unnumbered Presidential Memorandum dated <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of discharging this responsibility,
Jimenez approved the award to <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Enterprises,
which was represented by <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, Robles and Dario.</p>

<p class="BODY">Josefina <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span>, who was sent by
Jimenez to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> to make a
canvass, <span class="SpellE">inexpicably</span> delivered an advertisement for <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Enterprises, which was not a reputable supplier of
the needed items.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her Travel Report,
she certified that she made a canvass from reputable suppliers.</p>

<p class="BODY">These acts and omissions of Jimenez and <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span>
violated paragraph (a) of Section 3 of R.A. 3019 in relation to the Unnumbered
Presidential Memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
persuaded, induced or influenced, and persuaded, induced or influenced each
other, to award the purchase of electrical items to an entity which was not
even a supplier of electrical items in disregard of the Presidential Memorandum
directing that procurement of supplies by government offices should be from
reputable suppliers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rocen</span>
was not a "reputable supplier" as it was dealing only in paper
products and printed matter at the time of the transaction in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph (e) was likewise violated by Jimenez and <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span> because, with manifest partiality in the discharge
of their official and administrative functions, they gave unwarranted benefits,
advantage or preference to <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Enterprises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances of this case are sufficient to establish
conspiracy between Jimenez and <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span> in violating
the pertinent provisions of R.A. 3019 adverted to above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Direct evidence is not necessary to prove
such conspiracy, for as we held in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>A resort to circumstantial evidence is in the very nature of
things, a necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crimes are usually
committed in secret and under conditions where concealment is highly probable;
and to require direct testimony would in many cases result in freeing criminals
and would deny proper protection to society.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(20 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 261).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We believe, however, that <span class="SpellE">Montayre</span> and
Villa are not criminally liable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Montayre</span> was convicted as a conspirator
for having signed the reports of inspection, certificates of delivery, and
general vouchers before delivery of the items requisitioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, these were innocent acts
in view of the emergency nature of the purchase and the need to beat the expiry
date of the <span class="SpellE">CDCs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No criminal intent can be imputed to his having made the requisition
because the same was necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
no responsibility in determining the reputability of the supplier and did not
take part in making the canvass and awarding the purchase to <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Villa was likewise convicted as involved in the conspiracy for
having signed invoices, reports of inspection, certificates of delivery and
general vouchers before delivery of the items requisitioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is absolved of this charge like <span class="SpellE">Montayre</span>, for the same reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Villa, moreover, did not take part in the
canvassing of supplies.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that he was a member of the Bidding Committee and he
signed the Abstract of Bids and the approval of the lowest bid to <span class="SpellE">Rocen</span> Enterprises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, this act cannot be considered criminal as he relied in fact on
the canvass made and sealed bids procured by <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span>
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such reliance may have constituted negligence
but certainly not the gross inexcusable negligence punishable by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the offenses involved, the Court finds that only
paragraphs (a) and (e) of Section 3, R.A. 3019, in relation to this Unnumbered
Presidential Memorandum dated April 22, 1971, were violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no violation of paragraph (h) of R.A. 3019 as proof of
financial or pecuniary interest in the transaction on the petitioners’ part did
not follow from the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> finding that there
was overpricing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) was also not violated
because the Bidding Committee did not exercise <u>discretion</u> in the award
of the contract<sub> </sub>for purchase of the equipment, which had to be given
to the lowest bidder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> is AFFIRMED insofar as petitioners Jimenez
and <span class="SpellE">Sucalit</span> are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners Villa and <span class="SpellE">Montayre</span>
