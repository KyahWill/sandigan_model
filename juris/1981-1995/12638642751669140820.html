<p class="BODY">Some four years later, in April 1972, the parties entered into
another contract -- an Agency Manager's Contract -- and to implement his end of
it <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span> organized an agency or office to which he
gave the name M. <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span> and Associates, while
concurrently fulfilling his commitments under the first contract with the
Company.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In May, 1979, the Company terminated the Agency a Manager's
Contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After vainly seeking a
reconsideration, <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span> sued the Company in a civil
action and this, he was later to claim, prompted the latter to terminate also
his engagement under the first contract and to stop payment of his commissions
starting April 1, 1980.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Basiao</span> thereafter filed with the then
Ministry of Labor a complaint<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
against the Company and its president.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Without contesting the termination of the first contract, the complaint
sought to recover commissions allegedly unpaid <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>,
plus attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents
disputed the Ministry's jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">Basiao's</span>
claim, asserting that he was not the Company's employee, but an independent
contractor and that the Company had no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">obligation
to him for unpaid commissions under the terms and conditions of his contract.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter to whom the case was assigned found for <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He ruled
that the underwriting agreement had established an employer-employee
relationship between him and the Company, and this conferred jurisdiction on
the Ministry of Labor to adjudicate his claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said official's decision directed payment of his unpaid commissions
"* * equivalent to the balance of the first year's premium remaining
unpaid, at the time of his termination, of all the insurance policies solicited
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">by</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">* * </span>(him) in favor of the respondent company * *" plus 10%
attorney's fees.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This decision was, on appeal by the Company, affirmed by the
National Labor Relations Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the present petition for <i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>and prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The chief issue here is one of jurisdiction:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether, as <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span>
asserts, he had become the Company's employee by virtue of the contract invoked
by him, thereby placing his claim for unpaid commissions within the original
and exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter under the provisions of Section
217 of the Labor Code<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
or, contrarily, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>the Company
would have it, that under said contract <span class="SpellE">Basiao's</span>
status was that of an independent contractor whose claim was thus cognizable,
not by the Labor Arbiter in a labor case, but by the regular courts in an
ordinary civil action.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Company's thesis, that no employer-employee relation in the
legal and generally accepted sense existed between it and <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span>,
is drawn from the terms of the contract they had entered into, which, either
expressly or by necessary implication, made <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span>
the master of his own time and selling methods, left to his judgment the time,
place and means of soliciting insurance, set no accomplishment quotas and
compensated him on the basis of results obtained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was not bound to observe any schedule <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>working hours or report to any
regular station; he could seek and work on his prospects anywhere and at
anytime he chose to, and was free to adopt the selling methods he deemed most
effective.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Without denying that the
above were indeed the expressed or implicit conditions of <span class="SpellE">Basiao's</span>
contract with the Company, the respondents contend that they do not constitute
the decisive determinant of the nature of his engagement, invoking precedents
to the effect that the critical feature distinguishing the status of an
employee from that of an independent contractor is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">control</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, </span>that
is, whether or not the party who engages the services of another has the power
to control the latter's conduct in rendering such services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuing the argument, the respondents draw
attention to the provisions of <span class="SpellE">Basiao's</span> contract
obliging him to "* * observe and conform to all rules and regulations
which the Company may from time to time prescribe * *," as well as to the
fact that the Company prescribed the qualifications of applicants for
insurance, processed their applications and determined the amounts of insurance
cover to be issued as indicative of the control which made <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span>,
in legal contemplation, an employee of the Company.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the "control test" expressed in the following
pronouncement of the Court in the 1956 case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Viana</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Alejo</span> Al-<span class="SpellE">Lagadan</span></u>:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"* * <span class="SpellE">Indetermining</span> the existence of
employer-employee relationship, the following elements are generally
considered, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the selection
and engagement of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power of
dismissal; and (4) the power to control the employees’ conduct -- although the
latter is the most important element (35 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.
445). * *,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">has</span> been
followed and applied in later cases, some fairly recent.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, it is without question a valid test of the character of a contract or
agreement to render service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should,
however, be obvious that not every form of control that the hiring party
reserves to himself over the conduct of the party hired in relation to the
services rendered may be accorded the effect of establishing an
employer-employee relationship between them in the legal or technical sense of
the term.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A line must be drawn
somewhere, if the recognized distinction between an employee and an individual
contractor is not to vanish altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Realistically, it would be a rare contract of service that gives <span class="SpellE">untrammelled</span> freedom to the party hired and eschews any
intervention whatsoever in his performance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span>the engagement.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Logically, the line should be drawn between rules that merely
serve as guidelines towards the achievement of the mutually desired result
without dictating the means or methods to be employed in attaining it, and
those that control or fix the methodology and bind or restrict the party hired
to the use of such means.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first,
which aim only to promote the result, create no employer-employee relationship
unlike the second, which address both the result and the means used to achieve
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The distinction acquires particular
relevance in the case of an enterprise affected with public interest, as is the
business of insurance, and is on that account subject to regulation by the
State with respect, not only to the relations between insurer and insured but
also to the internal affairs of the insurance company.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>Rules and regulations governing the
conduct of the business are provided for in the Insurance Code and enforced by
the Insurance Commissioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is,
therefore, usual and expected for an insurance company to promulgate a set of
rules to guide its commission agents in selling its policies that they may not
run afoul of the law and what it requires or prohibits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of such a character are the rules which
prescribe the qualifications of persons who may be insured, subject insurance
applications to processing and approval by the Company, and also reserve to the
Company the determination of the premiums to be paid and the schedules of
payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>None of these really invades
the agent's contractual prerogative to adopt his own selling methods or to sell
insurance at his own time and convenience, hence cannot justifiably be said to
establish an employer-employee relationship between him and the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dearth of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">authority
</span>holding persons similarly placed as respondent <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span>
to be independent contractors, instead of employees of the parties for whom
they worked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Mafinco</u></span><u>
Trading Corporation </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Ople</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court ruled that a person engaged to sell soft drinks for another, using a
truck supplied by the latter, but with the right to employ his own workers,
sell according to his own methods subject only to prearranged routes, observing
no working hours fixed by the other party and obliged to secure his own licenses
and defray his own selling expenses, all in consideration of a peddler’s
discount given by the other party for at least 250 cases of soft drinks sold
daily, was not an employee but an independent contractor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Investment Planning Corporation of the Philippines vs.
Social Security </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">System</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
a case almost on all fours with the present one, this Court held that there was
no employer-employee relationship between a commission agent and an investment
company, but that the former was an independent contractor where said agent and
others similarly placed were:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) paid
compensation in the form of commissions based on percentages of their sales,
any balance of commissions earned being payable to their legal representatives
in the event of death or resignation; (b) required to put up performance bonds;
(c) subject to a set of rules and regulations governing the performance of
their duties under the agreement with the company and termination of their
services for certain causes; (d) not required to report for work at any time,
nor to devote their time exclusively to working for the company nor to submit a
record of their activities, and who, finally, shouldered their own selling and
transportation expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">More recently, in <u>Sara vs. NLRC</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that one who had been engaged by a rice miller to buy and sell rice
and <span class="SpellE">palay</span> without compensation except a certain
percentage of what he was able to buy or sell, did work at his own pleasure
without any supervision or control on the part of his principal and relied on
his own resources in the performance of his work, was a plain commission agent,
an independent contractor and not an employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents limit themselves to pointing out that <span class="SpellE">Basiao's</span> contract with the Company bound him to observe and
conform to such rules and regulations as the latter might from time to time
prescribe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No showing has been made that
any such rules or regulations were in fact promulgated, much less that any
rules existed or were issued which effectively controlled or restricted his
choice of methods <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">-- or the methods
themselves -- of selling insurance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Absent
such showing, the Court will not speculate that any exceptions or
qualifications were imposed on the express provision of the contract leaving <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span> "* * free to exercise his own judgment as to
the time, place and means of soliciting insurance."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter's decision makes reference to <span class="SpellE">Basiao's</span> claim of having been connected with the Company
for twenty-five years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever this is
meant to imply, the obvious reply would be that what is germane here is <span class="SpellE">Basiao's</span> status under the contract of <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1968</st1:date>, not the length of his relationship
with the Company.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, therefore, rules that under the contract invoked by
him, <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span> was not an employee of the petitioner,
but a commission agent, an independent contractor whose claim for unpaid
commissions should have been litigated in an ordinary civil action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter erred in taking cognizance
of, and adjudicating, said claim, being without jurisdiction to do so, as did
the respondent NLRC in affirming the Arbiter's decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion renders it unnecessary and
premature to consider <span class="SpellE">Basiao's</span> claim for commissions
on its merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed Resolution of the National Labor
Relations Commission is set aside, and the complaint of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Basiao</span> in RAB Case No.
