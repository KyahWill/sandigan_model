				<BR><STRONG>BARREDO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Motion for reconsideration filed by respondent Consolidated
Tobacco Industries of the Philippines, Inc. (CTIP) of the decision in this case
promulgated on September 12, 1974 insofar only as said decision refrains from
ruling on the matter of the refund to said respondent of the storage charges
alleged to have been advanced by it in order to secure the release of the
tobacco sold to it at the public auction sale thereof after having been seized
and confiscated by the government, the same having been illegally imported, as
ruled in the very decision in this case, and directs that said matter be
prosecuted administratively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
prayed that such directive be withdrawn and that the Court itself decide the
issue of whether or not <span class="SpellE">movant</span> is entitled to said
refund.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the comment on said motion as well as further representations
made by the Solicitor General in relation thereto, it is expressly stated that
the Commissioner of Customs has already "taken the unyielding position
that the claim for refund is without legal basis in view (allegedly) of the
explicit provisions of Section 2605 of the Tariff and Customs Code", to
use the very words of the comment dated November 13, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from this, it appears that the Bureau
of Customs and the Department of Finance do not seem to see eye to eye on the
matter at issue, as may be gleaned from the fact that notwithstanding the more
favorable posture of the Secretary of Finance, as indicated in his 1<sup>st</sup>
<span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> of October 31, 1974, copy of which is
attached to the counter-comment of respondent dated November 22, 1974, the
genuineness of which has never been questioned, the Bureau of Customs is
viewing the matter differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the Bureau of Customs does not only prefer that the matter in issue be
prosecuted by respondent administratively but has practically announced that if
such were done, respondent’s claim for refund would be definitely denied by
them.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, should respondent pursue
the administrative course directed in Our decision, it is a foregone conclusion
that it would not have any chance, since the mind of those who are supposed to
pass upon his claim, at least in the first instance, is already made up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, there is more than
sufficient ground to believe that the administrative proceeding would result in
denial of due process to respondent, considering that the authorities who will
act as judges, at least in the first instance, can no longer be expected to be
entirely impartial.</p>

<p class="BODY">“Elementary due process requires a hearing before an impartial
and disinterested tribunal.”<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Geotina</span> vs. Gonzales, 41 SCRA 66.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reiterating the same cardinal point in <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Gironella</span>, 65 SCRA 245, We held that:</p>

<p class="BODY">“It cannot be denied that elementary due process requires that a
case be heard by a tribunal that is impartial and disinterested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the accused has been the victim of an
unfair and partial trial, this court will certainly not hesitate to order a new
trial in the interest of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There is also a long line of decisions

from the memoranda of the parties, it is obvious that anyway the basic point in
dispute here is purely legal – apart from the obvious possibility that the
dispute will ultimately have to be brought to this Court – We have no
alternative but to consider the directive in Our decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are now persuaded that it would be in the
best interest of justice, if this Court were to resolve respondent’s claim for
refund aforementioned here and now on the basis of all that appears in the
records before Us, there being no indication after all that there are still
other relevant facts not yet brought to Our attention relevant to the matter in
dispute. </p>

<p class="BODY">Additional to the foregoing, it is likewise incontrovertible that
notwithstanding compliance by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> with all the
require­ments of the above-quoted letter, <span class="SpellE">movant</span> was
unable to secure delivery of the tobacco purchased by it in view of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of several court proceedings filed by petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>, wherein such
delivery was judicially enjoined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the last of those injunc­tions was lifted, and before another one could be
obtained by said petitioner, <span class="SpellE">movant</span> demanded delivery
of the tobacco but the Consolidated Terminals, Inc. (or Luzon Stevedoring Co.,
Inc.) in whose warehouses the tobacco was stored refused to release the same
without its being paid the storage fees due as of then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apprehensive that a new injunction might be
secured by <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span>,
which would further delay its getting delivery of the tobacco, and because the
Bureau of Customs could not immediately make the corresponding payment, <span class="SpellE">movant</span> paid the Consolidated Terminals, Inc. the storage
fees demanded in the amount of P823,768.20 on September 13, 1967, under an
express understanding, according to <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, with the
Bureau of Customs, thru then Collector of Customs, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>,
that the same would be refunded to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in Our decision, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the main case here, the Solicitor General sought authority from the Court to
effect "the refund to CTIP (<span class="SpellE">movant</span>) — of an
amount equal to cover the storage charges for the period or time normally
consumed in a regular importation, i.e., excluding the storage charges brought
about by the delay incident to the institution of the seizure proceedings,
since in any case this amount would be chargeable to the importer; here we are
anticipating the remote possibility (remote in view of the pronouncements of
this Honorable Court in Cesar <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> et al. vs.
Manuel Barcelona, et al., G.R. No. L-19597, prom. <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1962</st1:date>; Collector of Customs vs. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, G.R. No. L-21383, prom. <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1964</st1:date> and <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> vs. Court of Tax Appeals, et al., G.R. No. L-25181, <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1967</st1:date>) that petitioner will
obtain a reversal of the decision of the Court of Tax Appeals now under
review." And, it is precisely the matter referred to in that motion of the
Solicitor General that the Court had directed in the decision herein to be
prosecuted administratively, but which We now feel ought to be already resolved
here in view <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> of the
unyielding negative position of the Bureau of Customs, by reason of which <span class="SpellE">movant</span> is not certain it will be afforded due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is expected that this resolution should
put an end to all the aspects of the subject tobacco importation without
further unnecessary loss of time and effort prejudicial to all concerned,
particularly the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing premises, the fundamental issue to be resolved
boils down to what is the proper construction that should be given to Section
2605 of the Tariff and Customs Code which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2605.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disposition
of Proceeds. - The following charges shall be paid from the proceeds of the
sale in the order named:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="">a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Expenses
of appraisal, advertisement and sale.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duties except in the case of abandoned and
forfeited articles.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taxes
and other charges due the Government.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">d.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Government
storage charges.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">e.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> and private storage charges.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">f.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Freight, <span class="SpellE">lighterage</span>
or general average, on the voyage of importation, of which due notice shall
have been given to the Collector."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">in the light of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
terms and conditions under which <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> bid to
purchase the tobacco in question was accepted and approved by the customs
authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">As can be seen, among the items, apart from customs duties etc.,
that are deductible from the proceeds of any public auction sale of goods
confiscated by the Bureau of Customs is that for "<span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
and private storage fees," meaning evidently, that should any such <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> and/or storage fees corresponding to the goods
sold be due, the same should be paid out of the amount that the winning bidder
has paid, as accepted by the customs authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in connection with the tobacco herein
involved, in the letter of the Collector of Customs dated <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1970</st1:date> addressed to the Solicitor
General, it was expressly admitted that "Under Section 2605-e of the same
Code (the Customs and Tariff Code) expenses for the storage is deductible from
the proceeds from the sale of the tobacco." According to the Solicitor
General in his motion for leave referred to in our decision, "the same
view is expressed by Acting Commissioner of Customs in his letter to the
undersigned counsel dated <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1971</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1971" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1971</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are of the considered opinion that the section of the Customs
and Tariff Code cited cannot have any other intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so because until after goods
sold by the Bureau of Customs in an auction sale shall have been delivered
either actually or constructively to the winning bidder, ownership thereof
remains with that office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is the
unequivocal provision of Article 1477 of the Civil Code which says, "The
ownership of the thing sold shall be transferred to the vendee upon the actual
or constructive delivery thereof." Accordingly, it is but logical and
proper that, unless otherwise expressly stipulated, all expenses incurred for
the preservation and keeping or storage of the goods sold should be borne by
the Bureau until their actual or constructive delivery to the buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Relatedly</span>,
Condition No. 8 of the Notice of Sale provides that "Storage fees shall be
imposed on article awarded but not claimed within ten (10) days from the date
of approval of the sale." To Our mind, this provision, indicates that
responsibility for storage fees would pass to the buyer only upon the
occurrence of the contingency so stated and not earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Movant</span> did claim
the tobacco it had purchased within the ten-day period stipulated the Bureau of
Customs was the one not ready to comply.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government's reliance on Article 1476 of the Civil Code is
obviously inapposite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tobacco here
in question was not delivered to <span class="SpellE">movant</span> until <st1:date year="1967" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1967</st1:date> in view of court
injunctions, the last of which was dissolved only on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While of course it cannot be said that the delay was due to the fault of
the Bureau of Customs, much less, however, could any blame be attributed to the
<span class="SpellE">movant</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as
between these parties, there can be no doubt that responsibility for any
expenses or damages arising during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the injunction should be the liability of the owner of the goods who is under
obligation to warrant its title and right to sell and deliver the same to the
buyer free from any adverse claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, it was precisely for fear that the storage charges for which
the Bureau would be liable would be bigger that on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1965</st1:date>, Acting Collector Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> addressed the following self-explanatory letter to
the holder of the tobacco in question:</p>

<blockquote>"The Storekeeper</blockquote>

<blockquote>Customs Bounded Warehouse No. 81</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city></blockquote>

<blockquote>Sir:</blockquote>

<blockquote>In connection with the 600 hogsheads Virginia Leaf Tobacco involved
in Manila Seizure Identification No. 6669, which are presently stored in Customs
Bounded Warehouse No. 81 and which, pursuant to Section 2607 of the Tariff and
Customs Code, were sold to, and fully paid for by, the Consolidated Tobacco
Industries of the Philippines, Inc. after its bid was approved by the Cabinet
Committee on Public Bidding of Tobacco, please be informed that the Supreme
Court's order of July 3, 1963 against the delivery of the property issued sub­sequent
to the said purchaser's having earlier complied with the condition of award,
was super­seded by another order of the Supreme Court, per its Resolution of
April 8, 1965, which among others reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'RESOLVED, that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by it be
considered dissolved and of no further effect.'</p>

<blockquote>In view thereof and in line with the advice of the Solicitor
General in his 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> to this Office dated
April 22, 1965 and again in his 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> to
the Commissioner of Customs dated May 17, 1965, immediate release of the said
property to the Consolidated Tobacco Industries of the Philippines, Inc. should
be effected to above of further accumulation of storage charges and to
forestall any untoward incident that may take place effecting the property
before the Government is relieved of its obligation to deliver the same to the
aforesaid awardees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whatever storage charges are due in favor of the operator of the
aforementioned warehouse should be forwarded to this Bureau for settlement
pursuant to law.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">VVery</span> truly
yours,</blockquote>

<blockquote>((SGD.) PEDRO PACIS</blockquote>

Customs"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">(Pp. 483-484, Record.)</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot accept the contention in the Government's Memorandum of
March 31, 1976 that Condition No. 5 in the Notice of Sale to the effect that
"The above-mentioned articles (the tobacco) are offered for sale 'AS IS'
and the Bureau of Customs gives no warranty as to their condition"
relieves the Bureau of Customs of liability for the storage fees in
dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We understand said Condition
No 5, it refers to the physical condition of the tobacco and not to the legal
situation in which it was at the time of the sale, as could be implied from the
right of inspection to prospective bidders under Condition No. 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no bearing at all on the obligation of
the Bureau of Customs, as seller, under Article 1495 of the Civil Code "to
transfer the ownership and deliver, as well as warrant the thing which is
object of the sale." This warranty is as to the right to sell and capacity
to deliver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, applying
Condition No. 5 literally, there is reason to hold that, had the tobacco here
in issue suffered any deterioration after the sale, but before its delayed
actual release to <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, the latter could be
entitled to indemnity for any damage resulting from such deterioration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 1170, Civil Code.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In its aforementioned Memorandum, the Government contends that assuming
it is liable, it should refund to <span class="SpellE">movant</span> only
P47,382.36 corresponding to the period from June 25, 1962, when the tobacco was
stored to June 26, 1963 when the bid was finally approved by the Bureau of
Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That contention is devoid of
legal justification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law on
sales, once the object and the price are agreed upon, it becomes the
inescapable obligation of the seller to immediately deliver the object to the
buyer, unless a period for such delivery has been otherwise stipulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, the bid of <span class="SpellE">movant</span> was approved by the Bureau of Customs subject to the
condition that the tobacco in question was to be "released in favor of
CTIP (<span class="SpellE">movant</span>) upon the posting of a surety bond in
the amount of P1,000,000.00 to guarantee <span class="SpellE">CTIP's</span>
undertaking to export locally grown tobacco." (Letter of June <span style="">26, </span>1963 of Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span>, Chairman, Special Bidding Committee) That this
condition was duly complied with does not appear to be <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such compliance notwithstanding, release
was delayed, not only because of any court injunction but due also to seeming
difference of opinion at the time between the Collector and the Commissioner of
Customs as to who between them was supposed to order such release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See pp. 26-27, Annex A of the Petition.)
Surely, this circumstance cannot be taken against <span class="SpellE">movant</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government contends also that it would not be equitable to
make the Bureau of Customs liable for the refund demanded by <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, since the auction sale netted only P1.5 M, whereas
if the importation were allowed in 1961, the Government would have realized not
less than P3 M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument is not
persuasive, if only because the Court has precisely found the importation to be
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot see how any
consideration of inequity can be predicated on the hypothesis that something
judicially declared illegal was legal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Quite the other way around, the stand of the Government is what appears
to be inequitable, for whereas, the amount of P1.5 M paid by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> fully covers all the items enumerated in Section
2605, including the amount paid by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> for private
storage fees, still the Government refuses to refund <span class="SpellE">movant</span>,
notwithstanding that the provision just cited expressly ordains that the said
amount for storage fees is deductible from the accepted bid price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the Government is trying to
unjustly enrich itself at the expense of <span class="SpellE">movant</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, the decision of this Court
in the above-entitled case of September 12, 1974 is hereby modified only in the
sense that the administrative remedy therein suggested for the refund of
storage fees above discussed is hereby declared unnecessary and the Collector
of Customs and/or the Commissioner of Customs are hereby ordered to refund to <span class="SpellE">movant</span> Consolidated Tobacco Industries of the Philippines,
Inc. (CTIP) the amount of Eight Hundred Twenty-Three Thousand Seven Hundred
Sixty-Eight Pesos and Twenty Centavos (P823,768.29) paid by said <span class="SpellE">movant</span> to Luzon Stevedoring Corporation on September 13,
1967, without interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all other

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">Sir:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">This is in reply to your letter
dated March 24, 1966, requesting advice on the stand of this Office regarding
the release of the 600 hogsheads Virginia leaf tobacco by Collector Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span> to the Conso­lidated Tobacco Industries of the Philip­pines,
Inc. (CTIP) for purposes of comment to be submitted to the Supreme Court on the
petition to lift the preliminary injunction filed by the CTIP.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">After a careful examination of the
records of the case involving this commodity, we found the following:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1963" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1963</st1:date>, the Collector of Customs, thru the Chairman
of the Special Bidding Committee, Jose <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span>, had
accepted the bid offer of the CTIP to purchase the said tobacco for the sum of
P1,500,00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of such acceptance,
the CITP paid the sum of P1,500,00 and had exported 6 kilos of local Virginia
tobacco for every kilo of the 600 hogsheads in question in compliance with the
conditions set forth in the public bidding;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the auction sale conducted by the Bureau
regarding said tobacco, was approved by a Cabinet Committee (composed of
Secretary of Justice, Juan R. <span class="SpellE">Liwag</span>, Chairman,
Secretaries Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span>, Deputy Auditor
General Jesus <span class="SpellE">Yriarte</span> and Governor Andres Castillo,
as members), under a 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated June 24,
1963;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The validity and regularity of the forfeiture
and sale in public bidding, were passed upon and upheld by the Supreme Court in
the case of Collector of Customs <i>vs</i>. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>,
G.R. No. L-21389, promulgated <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="7">July 17,
 1964</st1:date>;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1965" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1965</st1:date>, the then Solicitor<span style=""> </span>General Arturo A. <span class="SpellE">Alafriz</span>, rendered an opinion "agreeing to the delivery
of the tobacco to the CTIP as justified under Section 2607 of the Tariff and
Customs Code, and then finally, on <st1:date year="1965" day="17" month="5">May
 17, 1965</st1:date>, the Solicitor General, again rendered an opinion favoring
the release in this wise.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"Finally, in a resolution of
the Supreme Court on <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1965</st1:date>,
in the same case, the Court considered dissolved the writ of preliminary
injunction previously issued by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
of now therefore, there exists no legal impediment to said release,
notwithstanding the appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> to the Court of Tax Appeals with respect to the
legality of the seizure and forfeiture proceedings against the tobacco and not
on the disposition thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had not the
Supreme Court issued the injunction in the <span class="SpellE">Arca</span> Case
in June, 1963, the Collector of Customs could have released the leaf tobacco in
question even during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the seizure and
forfeiture proceedings, subject of course to any existing valid liens, for he
is so authorized by the aforesaid Section 2607 to use his discretion in making
such a disposition, if the circumstances presently surrounding the said leaf
tobacco warrant the exercise of his discretion under the law."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.75in; text-indent: -0.25in;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="5">May
 18, 1965</st1:date>, the Collector of Customs issued the Order of Release
wherein he stated as follows:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">"In view thereof and in line
with the advice of the Solicitor General in his 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
to this Office dated April 22, 1965 and again in his 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
to the Commissioner of Customs dated May 17, 1965, immediate release of the
said property to the Consolidated Tobacco Industries of the Philippines Inc.
should be effected to shove off further accumulation of storage charges and to
forestall any untoward incident that may take place affecting the property
before the Government is relieved of its obligations to deliver the same to the
aforesaid awardees."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">As stated in your letter of March
24, 1966, it is your opinion that the <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> case
in the Court of First Instance of Manila docketed as Civil Case No. 61109,
entitled "Republic of the Philippines <i>vs</i>. Consolidated Tobacco
Industries of the Philippines", had been filed primarily to clarify as to
who has the authority to release the tobacco, and not for any other
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the given circumstances,
unless your Office as counsel for the government finds other legal impediments
in the release thereof, this Office is constrained to concur in the action by
the Collector of Customs of Manila.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">The Office has taken this position
because it is conscious of the fact that any unnecessary delay in the
disposition of the case will only expose the subject commodity to the danger of
deterioration thus risking the possibility of losing not only P1,500,000 as the
agreed price for the tobacco but also the storage charges due thereon <span style="">in the amount of </span>P4,000
a month since May 18, 1965.</p>

truly yours,</p>
