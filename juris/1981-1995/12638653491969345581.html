which affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the original
decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XX, dated December 28, 1984,
in Civil Case No. 39650, entitled "David <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>,
et al. vs. Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> de <span class="SpellE">Bais</span>,"
and set aside the partial modification thereof by the same trial court in its
order of May 7, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present litigation started thirty-one (31) years ago in the
then Court of First Instance of Manila when private respondents filed a
complaint for a sum of money against petitioner Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="3">March
 19, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their
complaint, private respondents, consisting of David <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>
and one hundred eighty (180) other sugar cane planters in <span class="SpellE">Bais</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, relied on Section 1 of Republic Act
No. 809, otherwise known as the Sugar Act of 1952, which in part provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of written milling agreements between the majority of planters and the
millers of sugar-cane in any milling district in the Philippines, the unrefined
sugar produced in that district from the milling by any sugar central of the
sugar-cane of any sugar-cane planter or plantation owner, as well as all
by-products and derivatives thereof, shall be divided between them as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sixty per centum for the planter, and forty per centum for the
central in any milling district the maximum actual production of which is not
more than four hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, That the provisions of this
section shall not apply to sugar centrals with an actual production of less
than one hundred fifty thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sixty-two and one-half per centum for the planter, and thirty-seven
and one-half <span class="SpellE">percentum</span> for the central in any milling
district the maximum actual production of which exceeds four hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> but does not exceed six hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sixty-five per centum for the planter, and thirty-five per centum
for the central in any milling district the maximum actual production of which
exceeds six hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> but does not
exceed nine hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sixty-seven and one-half per centum for the planter, and thirty-two
and one-half per centum for the central in any milling district the maximum
actual production of which exceeds nine hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>
but does not exceed one million two hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>Seventy per centum for the planter, and thirty per centum for the
central in any milling district the maximum actual production of which exceeds
one million two hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>By actual production is meant the total production of the mill for
the crop year immediately preceding."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the respondent court are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As alleged in the complaint, the plaintiffs-appellants were all
sugar cane planters <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>the
milling district of <span class="SpellE">Bais</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Oriental, who have been milling their sugarcane with appellant Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> de <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> since 1952, <u>without
any written</u> milling contracts or agreements between plaintiffs-appellants
and defendant-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further,
plaintiffs-appellants averred that prior to the enactment of the Sugar Act of
I952 (RA 809) as planters, they only had a 60% share in the sugar produced and
milled with appellant Central while the latter had 40%.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the enactment of R.A. 809, however, the
percentage of the share of the planters was gradually increased depending upon
the actual sugar production for each crop year and on whether or not the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">majority</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span>of the planters <u>had executed milling agreements</u> with
appellant Central.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
plaintiffs-appellants who have been milling their sugarcane with the appellant
Central from 1952-53 to 1958-59, <u>without any written milling contracts</u>
sought to compel the latter to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">give </span>to
them the increased participation as provided for in R.A. 809 alleging that they
constituted the majority of the sugarcane planters who milled with the
appellant Central during these crop years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant-appellant denied in its Answer all the material
allegations in the complaint and averred that the plaintiffs-appellants who
milled with the Central <u>did not constitute the majority</u> of the sugarcane
planters without written milling contracts arguing that it had written milling
contracts with the majority of its planters during the crop years in question,
thus, Sec. 1 of R.A. 809 could not apply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant-appellant likewise argued that R.A. 809 was unconstitutional
on the ground that it not only deprived the appellant Central of its properties
without due process of law but it also impaired the obligation of contracts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As an affirmative defense, appellant Central averred, among
others, that when the milling agreements executed in 1919 between the Central
and its adherent planters expired in 1949, defendant-appellant and the majority
of the planters in the milling district entered into a new milling contract to
be effective for ten (10) years commencing from 1949.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The new contract provided that the <u>subscribing
planters</u> receive as their share 62% of the unrefined sugar and molasses
resulting from the milling of their cane and they have certain obligations
which are not assumed by the non-subscribing planters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract also provided that the appellant
Central shall not grant to other planters, not signatories thereof, terms and
conditions more advantageous than those provided for in the said contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with the aforesaid restriction,
appellant Central has laid down the policy of granting to the planters <u>who
did not sign the milling agreement, only 60%</u> of the unrefined sugar
produced from their cane.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiffs-appellants therefore, who had been continuously delivering their
sugarcane for milling with full knowledge of the aforesaid restrictions imposed
in the contract and without protest, have thereby impliedly, if not expressly
accepted the conditions under which their sugarcane had been milled by the
appellant Central and have thus entered into a valid contract that they cannot
now demand for a bigger participation than that provided for in the said
contract." (Emphasis in the original text).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, upon
motion of herein petitioner central, the trial court suspended the proceedings
in an order dated August 25, 1970, on the ground that the issues in the present

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to respondent Court of Appeals the decision dated
December 28, 1984 and the order dated May 7, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents likewise appealed from
the order of May 7, 1985 insofar as said order partially modified the trial
court's decision of December 28, 1984, particularly on the question of interest
and on the ground that said order is contrary to law and the evidence
presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both appeals were docketed as
and adjudicated in CA-G.R. CV No. 07759.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 20, 1989, respondent court promulgated its decision
setting aside the May 7, 1985 order of the trial court and reinstated the
decision dated December 28, 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellate court approved the findings of the court below that the majority of
the planters who milled their sugar cane with petitioner in the crop years
involved did not have written milling contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it sustained the ruling that one
hundred per cent (100%) of the computed increased participation of the planters
should be paid to the latter, it being understood that under Section 9 of Republic
Act No. 809 sixty per centum (60%) thereof belongs to the laborers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It adopted the rule that after paying the
entire amount to the planters, they are in turn "directed to pay 60% of
the increased participation to their laborers under the supervision of the
Ministry (now Department) of Labor." Respondent court also ordered the
payment of interest at the rate of twelve per cent (12%) per annum, on the
basis of the rates charged by the Philippine National Bank on its regular
loans.</p>

<p class="BODY">An initial discussion of the fourth assignment of error is
necessary, it being a threshold issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On this score, petitioner claims that the Court of Appeals erred in
assuming that only those who actually affixed their signatures on the milling
agreements shall be considered contract planters or planters with milling
contracts; and, further, in declaring that the heirs of planters who signed
milling agreements can be counted as planters with milling contracts only if
they have already received their respective shares in their respective
inheritance, otherwise, they shall be counted only as one.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals, in so holding, explicated as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The lower court likewise was correct in observing and
concluding that of the 79 milling contracts presented by the defendant-appellant,
fifteen (15) thereof should be considered only singly and not by the numbers of
the planters which are named in the said contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason behind this is that the numerous
signatories are but heirs, legatees or successors-in-interest of a deceased
planter, and which could only be counted as one planter per contract, whose
plantation remained <u>whole</u> as before his death, <span class="SpellE">unsubdivided</span>
among his heirs, legatees or successors-in?interest, and, which in fact,
continues to be reflected in the books of the appellant Central as <u>one</u>
plantation just as it appeared in its records before the death of the original
owner-planter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Associacion</span> (sic) de <span class="SpellE">Agricultores</span>

<p class="BODY">Nothing in the quoted provision can be said to indicate that
direct payment to the laborers is required.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, under Section 1 of the law, the increased participation clearly
pertains to the planters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
construction of Republic Act No. 809 was applied in the case of <u>Ernesto</u>,
<u>et</u> <u>al</u>. <u>vs</u>. <u>The</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,
<u>et</u> <u>al</u>.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
where the planters, after receipt of the increased participation, were in turn
ordered to pay their respective laborers sixty per centum (60%) of such
difference as will be paid to them by the central, and the then Minister of
Labor was directed to supervise the corresponding payments to the
laborers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The correctness of this
procedure is evident since the planters are in a better position to distribute
the proportionate shares in the increased participation to their respective
laborers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The planters are correctly
assumed to know the amounts to be paid to each of their laborers by simply
examining their company records.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are, however, of the considered opinion that respondent court
erred in awarding interest on the basis of the lending rates imposed by the
Philippine National Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such an award
is bereft of statutory and jurisprudential basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the proper interest rate
to be imposed should be the legal rate of six per cent (6%) per annum provided
for in Article 2209 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This express provision of the law cannot be disregarded, since it
categorically declares that “(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)f the obligation
consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the debtor incurs in delay, the
indemnity for damages, there being no stipulation to the contrary, shall be the
payment of interest agreed upon, and in the absence of stipulation, the legal
interest, which is six per cent per annum.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The rate of interest should not be twelve per cent (12%) as
provided in the <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1985</st1:date>
order of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well
settled that the rate of interest of twelve per cent (12%) under Central Bank
Circular No. 416 is applicable only to loans or renewals thereof or forbearance
of money, goods, or credits or judgments in connection therewith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any other judgment, as in the present case,
is not covered thereby.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither may equity be validly invoked nor aptly relied upon in
this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Equity is available only in
the absence of law and not as its replacement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Equity is justice outside legality, which simply means that it cannot
supplant, although it may, as it often happens, supplement the law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, liberal interpretation in favor of private respondents is not in point
because no such interpretation is, in fact, necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law is clear that it is the legal interest
that shall be paid and an unwarranted deviation <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
would entail judicial legislation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, this objectionable result is anathema to our deeply rooted
doctrine of separation of powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that interest is due from the moment there is delay
on the part of the obligor to perform his obligation, that is, from the time it
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>judicially or <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> demanded.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, under Article 2213 of the Civil Code, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)<span class="SpellE">nterest</span> cannot be recovered upon <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>
claims or damages, except when the demand can be established with reasonable
certainty." <span class="SpellE">Unliquidated</span> damages or claims, it
is said, are those which are not or cannot be known until definitely
ascertained, assessed and determined by the courts after presentation of proof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, however we hold that the claim of private
respondents is for a definite sum of money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What they are claiming are specific percentages definitely provided
under the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is merely a matter of
mathematically computing the exact money value thereof, inasmuch as the annual
sugar production and the amount of molasses and <span class="SpellE">bagasse</span>,
derived from the production during the crop years involved, are undisputed and
are in fact based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>the records
of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Irremissibly, therefore,
the claim cannot be considered <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But even assuming <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">ex</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>argumenti</u></span> </span>that
it is <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>, the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">will </span>nevertheless fall under the exception in Article 2213
because the demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> can be established with
reasonable certainty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>absence of the law expressly
declaring that demand <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>not
necessary, the interest must be computed from the time of extrajudicial demand
which, as held by respondent court in this case, was established to have been
made in 1952 to comply with Republic Act No. 809<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
which was enacted in that year.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of attorney's fees, it is an accepted doctrine that
the award thereof as an item of damages is the exception rather than the rule, and
counsel's fees are not to be awarded every time a party wins a suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The power of the court to award attorney's
fees under Article 2208 of the Civil Code demands factual, legal and equitable
justification, without which the award is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a
</span>conclusion without a premise, its basis being improperly left to
speculation and conjecture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In all
events, the court must explicitly state in the text of the decision, and not
only in the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion thereof, the legal
reason for the award of attorney's fees.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is undeniable and evident that both the respondent appellate
court and the trial court completely violated the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
doctrinal rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In awarding attorney's
fees as damages, no justification <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is
advanced either in the decision of the trial court or of respondent appellate
court which affirmed the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
for this reason alone, the award must be deleted and any advertence we would
make herein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>petitioner's
alleged bad faith or good faith, as discussed in the exchanges of the parties
but disregarded in the aforesaid decisions of both lower courts, would be
