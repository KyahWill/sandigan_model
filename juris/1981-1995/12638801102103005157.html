				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>A letter-complaint was filed against the respondent who was
designated as Special Sheriff in Civil Case No. 59396 entitled “Vicente <span
class=SpellE>Ampa</span>, represented by his Attorney-in-fact <span
class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span> v. Vicente <span
class=SpellE>Cristi</span>, Jr., et al.” The charges against the respondent include:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1) grave misconduct; (2) gross negligence in
the performance of duties; and (3) disobedience to the written as well as
verbal orders of the Court.</p>

<p class=BODY>The complainant is the counsel for the defendant in Civil Case
No. 59396, an action for delivery of personal property wherein a writ of <span
class=SpellE>replevin</span> was initially issued by the trial court against
the Caterpillar bulldozer of the complainant’s client.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The said writ was executed by the respondent
acting as Special Sheriff.</p>

<p class=BODY>Upon motion by the complainant to quash the writ of <span
class=SpellE>replevin</span> and the filing of a counter-bond as required under
Sec. 5, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, the trial court, on <st1:date Year="1990"
Day="30" Month="5">May 30, 1990</st1:date>, ordered the return of the
Caterpillar bulldozer to Vicente <span class=SpellE>Cristi</span>, Jr.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The trial court’s order was never implemented
owing to the fact that the subject property which was deposited by the
respondent at the <span class=SpellE>Pasig</span> Capitol <span class=SpellE>Motorpool</span>
Compound was released by the Officer-in-Charge of the said <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span>
compound in favor of the plaintiff, not the defendant, in Civil Case No. 59396,
contrary to court orders.</p>

<p class=BODY>For failure of the respondent as the court officer entrusted with
the custody of the subject property to keep the same safely, as required, the
present administrative case was brought before the Office of the Court
Administrator which submitted the same for our consideration.</p>

<p class=BODY>Respondent Special Sheriff denies all the charges against him
averring that he placed the subject bulldozer in the <span class=SpellE>Pasig</span>
Capitol <span class=SpellE>Motorpool</span> Compound in the honest belief that
no other place is as safe to keep such valuable equipment; that he exercised
all safeguards to protect the subject property and cautioned the
Officer-in-Charge of the <span class=SpellE>Motorpool</span> Compound to
release the bulldozer under his care only when ordered by the court, and that
the loss of the subject property could not be attributed to him but to the said
Officer-in-Charge who released the same without his knowledge and consent.</p>

<p class=BODY>In our Resolution dated <st1:date Year="1990" Day="26" Month="11">November
 26, 1990</st1:date>, we referred this matter to the Executive Judge of the
Regional Trial Court of <span class=SpellE>Pasig</span>, Metro Manila whose
investigation disclosed the following factual findings:</p>

<blockquote>“It appears that when Special Sheriff Alberto Santos and plaintiff <span
class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span> asked <span
class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz the officer-in-charge of the DPWH <span
class=SpellE>Motorpool</span> in <span class=SpellE>Pasig</span>, Metro Manila
- to allow them to make use of the said <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span> as
a temporary shelter for the bulldozer they will get from <span class=SpellE>Marikina</span>
thru a writ of <span class=SpellE>replevin</span>, <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz refused their request, for the latter believed that the <span
class=SpellE>motorpool</span> owned by the Government was not suitable for any
private vehicle or property to be garaged there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He later on agreed, however, after Special
Sheriff Alberto Santos explained to him that the bulldozer is owned by
plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span>, and
the latter pleaded to <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz and told him that
the bulldozer would be placed in the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span> for
five (5) days only, because they will secure a court order to allow them to
take the bulldozer to the province.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(TSN, testimony of <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz, February 22,
1991, pp. 4-6, 22-23)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Pursuant to the said writ of <span class=SpellE>replevin</span>
dated May 11, 1990, Special Sheriff Alberto Santos and plaintiff <span
class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span> got the bulldozer
from defendant Vicente <span class=SpellE>Cristi</span>, Jr. and placed it
inside the DPWH <span class=SpellE>Motorpool</span> between 6:00 and 7:00 in
the evening of the same date; but <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz would
not officially receive the bulldozer from defendant Vicente <span class=SpellE>Cristi</span>,
Jr. and refused to sign any receipt <span class=SpellE>therefor</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although Special Sheriff Alberto Santos
pleaded to him to sign a receipt for the said bulldozer, <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz hedged, saying there was no need for said receipt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Despite such refusal of <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz to issue any receipt for the bulldozer, however, Special Sheriff Alberto
Santos left the said equipment in the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These facts were duly admitted by the said
special sheriff in his testimony (TSN, February 26, 1991, pp. 4, and 13).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“After more than five (5) days elapsed and the bulldozer was not
taken out of the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span>, <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz went to see Special Sheriff Alberto Santos in his office and asked him to
locate plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span>
so that he may take the bulldo<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>z</span>er,
for he (Diaz) would use the space occupied by the bulldozer because sixty-one
(61) pieces of pipes would be placed in the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span>
to be used in a DPWH project; but Special Sheriff Alberto Santos told him that
he also could not find <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span>
and said that he will tell <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span> <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>about </span>it should he meet him (TSN,
Testimony of <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz, February 22, 1991, pp. 6-7,
and 36).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was partly confirmed by
Special Sheriff Alberto Santos who testified that <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz came to his office looking for <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pornel</span> and was asking as to when the bulldozer would be
taken out of the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span> compound (TSN, February
26, 1991, p. 6)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“It appears further that from the time that the bulldozer was
placed in the <span class=SpellE>Motorpool</span> compound on May 11, 1990 and
up to the time that the said equipment was taken by plaintiff <span
class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span> in the evening of
June 2, 1990, Special Sheriff Alberto Santos never visited the bulldozer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was testified to by <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz, the officer-in-charge of the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span> (TSN,
February 22, 1991, p. 8) <span class=GramE>This</span> was also confirmed by
Special Sheriff Alberto Santos who admitted that he never visited the bulldozer
in the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span>, for he could very well see it from
the window of his office.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He admitted
further that the last <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>time he </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>saw </span>the bulldozer inside the <span
class=SpellE>motorpool</span> was in the afternoon of June 1, 1990 (a Friday)
before the close of office hours; that he did not look out of the window to
check if the bulldozer was in the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span> on June
4, 5 and 6, 1990; and that he came to <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>know
for the first time </span>that the bulldozer <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt'>was </span>released on June 2, 1990 by <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz to plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span>
in the morning of June 7, 1990 - when the defendant Vicente <span class=SpellE>Cristi</span>,
Jr. came to his office to ask for the release of said bulldozer to him pursuant
to the Order of the Court dated May 30, 1990.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(TSN, February 26, 1991, pp. 6, 8-9 &amp; 15)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The evidence also shows that Special Sheriff Alberto Santos did
not furnish <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz with copies of the Court
Order dated May 10, 1990 and the Writ of <span class=SpellE>Replevin</span>
dated May 11, 1990 - both of which ordered the said sheriff to take the
possession of the bulldozer from defendant Vicente <span class=SpellE>Cristi</span>,
Jr. and to keep it in his custody.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This
was admitted by the above named sheriff in his testimony, although he claims
that he showed the said order and writ together with the summons to <span
class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz (TSN, February 26, 1991, p. 8).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz
maintains, on <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>the </span>other hand,
that Special Sheriff Alberto Santos told him that he is an employee of the
Court; and that the said sheriff and <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pornel</span> told him that they have an Order from the Court to
take the bulldozer from <span class=SpellE>Marikina</span>, but they did not
show the order to him and he did not see it (TSN, February 22, 1991, pp. 7 and
21).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Special Sheriff Alberto Santos asserts that he told <span
class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz not to release the bulldozer to anyone - in
compliance with the order of the Court dated <st1:date Year="1990" Day="16"
Month="5">May 16, 1990</st1:date> directing him to withhold delivery of the
bulldozer until pending “Urgent Motion <span class=GramE>To</span> Quash Writ
of <span class=SpellE>Replevin</span>” has been resolved (TSN, February 26,
1991, p. 4).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Such assertion, however, is
denied by <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz who testified that during the
whole time that the bulldozer was in the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span> he
does not remember any time when Special Sheriff Alberto Santos visited it, and
that he (Diaz) did not receive any Order of the Court about the said bulldozer
(TSN, February 22, 1991, pp. 7-8)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Finally, Special Sheriff Alberto Santos maintains in his testimony
that <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz should not have released the
bulldozer to plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span>,
because before the said bulldozer was placed in the <span class=SpellE>Motorpool</span>,
he (Santos) told <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz that the bulldozer is
the subject matter of a <span class=SpellE>replevin</span> case wherein the
true ownership thereof would be determined; that nobody could take the
bulldozer unless he personally delivers to <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz an Order from the Court; that in compliance with the Order of the Court
dated May 16, 1990, he also told <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz not to
release the bulldozer to anyone; and that he never told <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz that plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span>
is the owner of the bulldozer or that he could release the said bulldozer to
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(TSN, February 26, 1991, pp. 3<span
class=GramE>,4</span>, 9-10).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These
declarations of Special Sheriff Alberto Santos, however, are denied by <span
class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz who, in his testimony, said that Special
Sheriff Alberto Santos introduced <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pornel</span> to him as the owner of the bulldozer (TSN, February
22, 1991, pp. 6,14 and 26); that he was not made to understand (by Special
Sheriff Alberto Santos and plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span
class=SpellE>Pornel</span>) that they were depositing the bulldozer in his
premises by order of the court or that it could not be removed <span
class=SpellE>therefrom</span> without a court order (Ibid. p. 37); and that
Special Sheriff Alberto Santos did not warn him that if the bulldozer would be
lost, he (<span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz) will be responsible <span
class=SpellE>therefor</span> (Ibid, pp. 34 &amp; 36)” (Report, pp. 5-7)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>From the foregoing findings, the Executive Judge who conducted
the investigation reached the following conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'>x</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt'> </span><span class=SpellE>x</span> it is the
conclusion of the undersigned investigator that Special Sheriff Alberto Santos
failed to comply with the duty and responsibility required of him under Sec. 4
of Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, earlier quoted above.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He placed the bulldozer subject matter of the
writ of <span class=SpellE>replevin</span> at the DPWH <span class=SpellE>Motorpool</span>
without requiring its officer-in-­charge, <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz, to officially receive the said bulldozer or to sign a receipt <span
class=SpellE>therefor</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He failed
to make <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz fully understand that the
ownership of the bulldozer is yet to be determined by the Court and that said
bulldozer cannot be removed from the <span class=SpellE>motorpool</span>
without any order from the said Court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The said respondent failed to take the necessary steps in order that <span
class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz, as officer­-in-charge of the DPWH <span
class=SpellE>Motorpool</span>, would be liable for the loss or damage of the
bulldozer should he release it without the said Court Order.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He failed to give <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span>
Diaz a copy of the Court Order dated May 16, 1990 directing him (sheriff) to
withhold delivery of the bulldozer to anyone, pending resolution of defendant’s
“Urgent Motion To Quash Writ of <span class=SpellE>Replevin</span>”, and he
also failed to show to <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz the Order of the
Court dated May 30, 1990 which ordered him to return the bulldozer to defendant
Vicente <span class=SpellE>Cristi</span>, Jr.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Neither did he inform <span class=SpellE>Nunilo</span> Diaz that
although plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Alwin</span> <span class=SpellE>Pornel</span>
had filed a motion for reconsideration of said Order dated <st1:date Year="1990"
Day="30" Month="5">May 30, 1990</st1:date>, the motion would still be heard on <st1:date
Year="1990" Day="4" Month="6">June 4, 1990</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All these acts of Special Sheriff Alberto
Santos constitute gross negligence in the performance of his duties in the
execution of the writ of <span class=SpellE>replevin</span> issued in Civil
Case No. 59396, which resulted in the loss or unlawful release of the bulldozer
subject matter of the writ by the officer-in-­charge of the DPWH <span
class=SpellE>Motorpool</span> - to whom he left the said<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

or responsibility of said official involving the custody thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

</span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Orders of the Court.<span

<p class=BODY>After a thorough examination of the records of this case, we see
no cogent reason to disregard the factual findings of the Investigating

Investigating Judge’s conclusion that <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt'>the

reasonable amount of respondent’s salary.</p>

processes and writs originating from his court and the branches thereof, and
those that may be delegated in him from other courts (see SC Administrative

officer is expected to all the more act with utmost care and diligence whenever
he is assigned to work in a special or acting capacity so much so that in the
discharge of his duties in such special acting capacity, he must do so with
prudence, caution and attention which careful men usually exercise in the
