<p class="BODY">On the merits now, the People present this account of the alleged
factual backdrop of this case:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1985</st1:date>
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30</st1:time> in the evening, Maj. <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, Regional Chief, <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> Region IV at <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>,
Laguna, received information from an informer that one alias 'Ben' was selling
'marijuana' somewhere at <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Looc</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maj. <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span> immediately organized a team for a 'buy-bust'
operation, composed of Sgt. Gilberto <span class="SpellE">Gumawid</span>, <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> agent <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Yee and
CIC Edgar <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Together with the informer, the team proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Looc</span> (TSN, 10-23-­85, pp. 5-7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon arrival, the team members took their respective
positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Gumawid</span>
and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span> posted themselves in a place about
(20) twenty meters from where alias 'Ben' was (Alias 'Ben' turned out later to
be appellant <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Agent Yee posed as
buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Together with the informer, Yee
approached appellant <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The informer introduced agent Yee to <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span> as one who wanted to buy marijuana after which the
informer left (TSN, 10-23-85, pp. 7-11).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After a while, <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span> also left.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moments later, <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span>
returned accompanied by one alias 'Fritz' (who turned out later to be appellant
<span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> Fernandez).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant Fernandez handed Agent Yee <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>tin foil containing dried crushed marijuana leaves and, in
turn, Agent Yee handed to him the marked ten peso bill (TSN, 10-23-85, pp.
13-15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Right after the sale was
consummated, Agent Yee gave signal to his two other companions who approached
them to effect the arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sensing them,
appellant Fernandez drew a gun from his waist but Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Gumawid</span>
wrested it away from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking
advantage of the situation, appellant <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span> ran
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They recovered from the pocket of
Fernandez the marked ten peso bill used to pay (for) the marijuana (TSN,
10-23-85, pp. 15-17).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, the apprehending team brought appellant Fernandez
to the police headquarters where he was investigated by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> <span class="SpellE">Ansioco</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The confiscated marijuana was brought to the National Bureau
of Investigation for chemical examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In her report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'M') which was confirmed
by the Supervising Forensic Chemist, Leonora C. <span class="SpellE">Vallado</span>
and Rosa Zamora <span class="SpellE">Manalad</span>, Chief of the Forensic
Chemist Section, forensic chemist Ma. Lourdes Duncan found the specimens
positive for marijuana, a prohibited drug (TSN, 12-11-85, pp. 14-19)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Traversing the presentation of the prosecution, the version of
accused <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span> was synthesized by the court below in
its decision, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The night of <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1985</st1:date>, after having garaged or retired his tricycle, he was told
by a nephew that he was to be arrested by NARCOM agents that night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He called <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span>
Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Quiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Herce</span>
to his house at <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Looc</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, Laguna, to confer with them on what to do
regarding the impending arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
two came, he told them that he and Fernandez were to be arrested by NARCOM
agents instigated by Andres <span class="SpellE">Narvaja</span>, a NARCOM agent
whose brothers Vic and Felix <span class="SpellE">Narvaja</span> they have
earlier charged for frustrated homicide.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"They decided to refer their problem to the <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span> Police Station, so they all rode (on) the tricycle
of <span class="SpellE">Quiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Herce</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While on their way to town, their tricycle
was blocked by a <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He and <span class="SpellE">Quiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Herce</span> ran away leaving behind <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span>
Fernandez who was <span class="SpellE">sitted</span> (sic) inside the side
car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed he never left <span class="SpellE">Brgay</span>. <span class="SpellE">Looc</span> from the time this
incident happened on <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1985</st1:date>,
till <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1985</st1:date>,
during which time he continuously drove a tricycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was arrested only on <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1985</st1:date>, by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Cansanay</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Afuang</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span>, in his assignment of
errors in this appeal, submits that the lower court committed reversible error
(1) when it convicted the accused on the strength of the testimonies of S/Sgt.
Edgar <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span> and Rosa Zamora <span class="SpellE">Manalad</span>,
and (2) when it imposed the maximum penalty of life imprisonment on the basis
of a not altogether convincing evidence founded on the testimonies of the two
(2) witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As the conviction of the accused was anchored on the testimony of
a lone eyewitness and corroborated in part by documentary evidence
authenticated by another, a meticulous review of the evidence and the
conclusions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is called for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Courts must be extra

unusually severe penalties for drug offenses.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">A reading of the appellant's brief, the assigned errors wherein
are tenaciously assailed by the Solicitor General, shows the debility of the
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Primarily, appellant claims
that S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Edgard</span> <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span>
and Rosa Zamora-<span class="SpellE">Manalad</span> are not the best witnesses to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and that their
testimonies would at best be secondary, if not hearsay, considering that there
are others more qualified and convincing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
</span>testify.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This submission is bereft of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The matter of presentation of its witnesses
by the prosecution is not for the accused or, except in a limited sense, for
the trial court to control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Discretion
belongs to the city or provincial fiscal as to how the prosecution should
present its case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He has the right to
choose whom he would present as witness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, if the defense believes that there are other witnesses who could have
exculpated the accused, it should have called for them, even by compulsory
process.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Next, appellant faults the prosecution for not filing a charge
for illegal possession of firearm and/or ammunition against accused <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> Fernandez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to say, as aptly argued by the Solicitor General, that the
filing of a complaint for illegal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">possession
of firearms is entirely immaterial and irrelevant in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is a matter that may be taken up at the
proper juncture and not as an incident of the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, appellant stresses the fact that Rosa Zamora-<span class="SpellE">Manalad</span>, Chief of the Forensic Chemist Section of the
National Bureau of Investigation, merely confirmed the report of one Ma.
Lourdes Fernandez-Duncan, a senior toxicologist, and did not personally examine
whether or not the specimen is positive for marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly observed by the Solicitor
General and borne out by the records, while it is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">true that Ma. Lourdes Duncan performed the chemical </span>analysis,
her report was submitted to Leonora C. <span class="SpellE">Vallado</span>,
Supervising Chemist of the Forensic Division of said bureau, who likewise
conducted a separate examination on the same specimen before affixing her
signature of confirmation on the report.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rosa Zamora­-<span class="SpellE">Manalad</span> never testified in this
case, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was
</span>erroneously stated in the decision of the trial court and in appellant's
brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite apparent that appellant's brief has made out a weak
case for the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may,
however, our inquiry does not end there nor should we necessarily sustain the
conviction decreed by the lower court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We are guided by the cardinal and long standing rule in this
jurisdiction, the plethora of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cases
whereon renders citations unnecessary, that to merit conviction the prosecution
must rely on </span>the strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of
the evidence presented by the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An accused must always be deemed innocent until the contrary is proved
beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A more careful scrutiny of the testimony of S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span> reveals not mere minor contradictions but a lacuna
in the evidence fatal to a finding of guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although he was supposedly at a distance of about twenty (20) meters
away, <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span> attested to the following facts:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You stated that you positioned yourself
together with Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Gumawid</span> while agent Yee must
contact <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben, where was your informant at that
time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was with <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Yee, sir.</blockquote>

was the role of this informant?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was the one who contacted <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben so that Ben can sell marijuana to <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Yee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As you stated of (sic) that distance of 20
meters, you can see Yee, was there an instance before the contact of Yee and <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben where your informer leave (sic) the place, or
leave away (sic) from Agent Yee?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened when informant leave (sic)
Agent Yee?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The informant left agent Yee as he has
introduced Yee to <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben to buy marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Was the
sale consummated at that very moment?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes your honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT: <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>How
did Yee consume (sic) that sale?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yee handed the money, then <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben gave the marijuana to him."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span>, however, later corrected
himself:</p>

<blockquote>"A<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As soon as
the informant introduced Yee to <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben, there was a
conversation that took place, I was a little far and so we did not hear the
conversation, but from what we gathered from their action, that we saw, there
might have been an agreement to sale (sic), <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben
left the place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT: <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>After Yee was
introduced to <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben by the informant, the
informant left?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, your honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span>
Ben left?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meaning to say <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span>
Ben left Yee in that place?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where did <span class="SpellE">Alyas</span>
Ben go?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alyas</span> Ben walked
along the street and I lost sight of him when he turned one of those alleys,
your honor.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

what happened?</blockquote>

If S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span> was really an eyewitness, he could
not have been mistaken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in the

<p class="BODY">Now, the question that irresistibly demands an answer is how the
illicit transaction was really consummated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the vacillating testimony of the supposed eyewitness, this remains
in the realm of dubiety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, it goes
without saying that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">conviction of
the accused must satisfy the test of moral certainty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the same witness stated that after the sale was

finished.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">On top of these, S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Groyon</span> stated

<u>marijuana</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>pocket</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>latter</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only after a leading question came from the

<u>from</u> <u>accused</u> <u>Fernandez</u> <u>was</u> <u>the</u> <u>money</u> <u>and</u>
<u>not</u> <u>the</u> <u>marijuana</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing inconsistencies from the very lips of the star
witness of the prosecution convince us that conscience should not allow the
fate of both accused to rest on the uncorroborated and unreliable testimony of
so mercurial a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">A rule of unquestioned respectability in criminal jurisprudence
is that if the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts and circumstances
are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent with the
innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his guilt, then the
evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is not sufficient to
support a conviction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
With the testimony of the lone eyewitness of the prosecution having been
irreparably punctured by irreconcilable discordance and shredded by inexpiable
doubts, through causes of his own making, it is all too clear that the
prosecution has failed to discharge the <u>onus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>probandi</u></span>
for conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now return to what we clarified at the outset with respect to
accused <span class="SpellE">Josefino</span> Fernandez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While, in effect, he committed an act of
defiance of the law by escaping, we are not without other prior incidents where
such undesirable conduct, which should not be condoned, has sometimes been
ascribed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>sense of
desperation of those who believe they are guiltless but fear that they cannot
prove their innocence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While we
castigate and reprove his jumping bail and remaining at large up to now, we
have to concede, however, that our disquisition in this case is applicable and
favorable to him, hence he is affected by and shall benefit from the acquittal
that we hand down in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appealed decision is REVERSED and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">SET ASIDE </span>and both accused are hereby
