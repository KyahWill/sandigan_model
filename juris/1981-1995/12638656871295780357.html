<blockquote>On August 7, 1987, Police Major <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
A. Sanchez, Chief of the Anti-Narcotics Unit (ANU) of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City Police Station sent a team of ANU agents composed of Policemen <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Marte</span> and Police Aide Francisco Garcia, Jr. to conduct
surveillance and buy-bust operation on suspected marijuana pushers along 11th
Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, acting on the report of a
confidential informant that marijuana was being peddled on said street.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon reaching the designated place on the afternoon of the
aforesaid date, policeman <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> left his
companions at a certain distance and proceeded with the confidential informant
to the place where accused <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>, alias <span class="SpellE">Papay</span>, was . . . <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> was introduced to <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>
by the confidential informant . . . <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> made it
appear that he was a regular user of marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> was able to convince <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> [to sell him marijuana] and gave him a marked P10.00
bill but was made to wait by <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> who left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a while <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>
returned and handed to <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> four (4) sticks of
suspected marijuana cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> opened the four (4) sticks to determine that they
are really marijuana, and thereafter, made the pre-arranged signal to his
companions who arrived and together they checked <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>
and arrested him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Postrado</span>
and his companions then conducted <span style="">a </span>spot
interrogation of <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> to find out where <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> got the marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> pointed to the house of the other
accused <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> Belen, alias <span class="SpellE">Adoy</span>,
which was about twenty?five (25) meters away from the place where <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> was apprehended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The anti-narcotics team, together with <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>,
proceeded to the house of Belen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> knocked at the door and called for Belen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somebody opened the door and they saw Belen
seated in front of crushed marijuana leaves placed on a spread-out newspaper,
segregating the seeds or those parts which couldn't be useful when hand-rolled
into cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Belen was arrested and
upon being frisked, the marked P10.00 bill was found in the right front pocket
of his pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The P10.00 bill was the
same P10.00 which <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> gave to <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> in consideration for the four (4) sticks of
marijuana cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also confiscated
in the house of Belen were thirty-five (35) sheets of cigarette rolling paper
and five (5) empty small plastic bags.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The P10.00 bill was marked with the letters "RRP" which
are the initials of <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> and its serial number
CL281211 were listed down before the same was handed to <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Both accused were then brought to the police headquarters for
investigation where they verbally admitted the charges imputed against them but
refused to reduce the same into writing after having been duly apprised of
their constitutional rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The four (4) sticks of cigarettes and 9.6 grams of crushed, dried
leaves of suspected marijuana, after being marked for identification purposes
with the letters WLT, the initials of police investigator Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Tomondong</span>, were sent
to the NBI Forensic Chemistry Section for examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miss Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Pizzaro</span>,

passengers along 11th Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> and companions
arrived in a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and took him for a
ride; along the way his hands were handcuffed and <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span>
asked him whether he knew anybody selling marijuana; the policemen tried to
force him to divulge the name of the person selling marijuana but he repeatedly
refused to do so until they mentioned the name <span class="SpellE">Adoy</span>,
his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> Belen; he then told them he
knew Belen as well as his residence; he pointed the house of Belen when they
were about three houses or about thirty meters away from said house; <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Marte</span> left him in
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and proceeded to the house of Belen and
kicked the door; before the incident he already knew <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span>
because the latter frequented the facade of <span class="SpellE">Ericson</span>
Drug Store along 11th Avenue; Belen was ordered to come down from his house and
both accused were handcuffed together; he did not see the policemen carry
anything with them when they went out of the house of Belen; they were brought
to the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Hall then to <span class="SpellE">Dagat-Dagatan</span>
reclamation area where they were to be salvaged but later brought to the police
headquarters; he denied any knowledge of the four sticks (4) of marijuana and
marijuana flowering tops as the first time he saw said items was in the police
headquarters; he likewise denied receiving the P10.00 bill but <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> insisted in giving it to him,: he does not know of
any reason why <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> would charge him this
offense.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The last defense witness
was the accused <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> Belen whose testimony was
summarized by the trial court thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>On August 17, 1987 at about 2:45 p.m. while he was taking his snack
inside his house at 11th Avenue, somebody knocked at the door:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they introduced themselves as policemen and
were going to arrest him for possession of marijuana; he denied such possession
and asked them if they had a warrant of arrest which they failed to present; he
then heard a loud noise and <span style="">saw </span><span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> coming to his house with a
policeman; <span class="SpellE">Postrado</span> poked a gun at him at the time he
entered his house: when the policemen found nothing in his house, he was
handcuffed and brought to the police headquarters:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he denied that the marijuana leaves were
taken from his house:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the first
time he saw the said marijuana was inside the courtroom:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he likewise denied that the P10.00 bill was
confiscated from him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Trial Court Decision, p. 4.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the trial court ruled that the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">warrantless</span></span><span style=""> search made on the house of Belen was
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marked P10.00 bill and the
thirty-five (35) sheets of cigarette rolling paper seized <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
were excluded for being inadmissible as evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Belen was acquitted, the trial court,

Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant assails the

trapping and capturing the law breakers in the execution of their criminal
plan:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whereas, in instigation, the

be acquitted.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In any case, the alleged inconsistencies just discussed, which
were proven to be not so, as well as the other inconsistencies mentioned in the
appellant's brief, are neither substantial nor of such nature as to cast a
grievous doubt on the credibility of the prosecution <span style="">witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The established rule
of evidence is that inconsistencies in the testimony of prosecution witnesses
with respect to minor details and collateral matters do not affect either the
substance of their declaration, their veracity or the weight of their testimony

witnesses, if only in minor details, reinforce rather than weaken their
credibility, for it is usual that witnesses to a stirring event should see
differently some details of </span>a startling occurrence [People v. De <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-<span style="">21419, <span class="SpellE">Septemberr</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In fine, the Court, after
a thorough examination of the entire record of the case, finds no substantial
reason to depart from the established rule that the Supreme Court regards with
respect and will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court on the
credibility </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">witnesses, unless certain facts of substance
and value have been overlooked which if considered might affect the result of
the case [People v. <span class="SpellE">Sinaon</span>, G.R. No. L-15613, </span><st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1966</st1:date>, 17 SCRA 260:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People v. <span class="SpellE">Abonada</span>,

169 SCRA 530.] Moreover, the principal prosecution witnesses in this case,
whose credibility the trial court sustained, are law enforcers who are presumed
by law to have regularly performed their duty in the absence of proof to the
contrary [Rule 131, Sec. 5(m), Rules of Court:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People v. <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>, G.R. No. 76893, February 27,
1989, 170 SCRA 681.] It is presumed that they could have had no other motive to
testify the way they did except to enforce the laws, particularly the Dangerous
Drugs Act, as is their bounden duty [People v. <st1:place>Yap</st1:place>. G.R.
Nos. 87088-89, <st1:date year="1990" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1990</st1:date>.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Having sustained the findings of the trial court on the
credibility of the prosecution witnesses, the defense put up by the accused,
denial cannot be accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has
consistently held that denial, like alibi, is inherently a weak defense and
cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution
witnesses that the accused committed the crime [People v. Chavez, G.R. No.
L-38603, September 30, 1982, 117 SCRA 221; <span style="">People v. Torres, G.R. No. 76711, September 26, 1988, </span>165 SCRA

<p class="BODY">The Court, after a careful study of the case, including its
entire record, finds the evidence presented by the prosecution, upon which the
trial court based its judgment of conviction, to be overwhelmingly against the
pretended innocence of the appellant and has proved to a moral certainty the
latter's guilt of the crime of selling prohibited drugs.</p>
