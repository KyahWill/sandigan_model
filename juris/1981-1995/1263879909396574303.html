subject to the conditions that he would assign all payments to be received from
the Bureau of Public Works of the GSIS to the bank, furnish a surety bond, and
the surety to deposit P10,000.00 to the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total accommodation granted to <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> was P100,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">In due course the Court of Appeals rendered the decision adverted
to above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In disposing of the assigned
errors, it patiently examined and analyzed the facts and made an extensive,
exhaustive and well-reasoned disquisition thereon which We deem necessary to
quote:</p>

<blockquote>"The assignment of error maybe (sic) reduced into one single
question, - what is the obligation of Luzon under the surety bonds, or, stated
otherwise, what obligation had been guaranteed by Luzon under the terms of the
surety bonds?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the contention of
the plaintiff that the surety bonds, Exhibits D and E, guaranteed the payment
of the loans or the debt of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> to the plaintiff
to the extent of P100<span style="">,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Luzon, however, contends that what it
guaranteed was the performance of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> of <span style="">his </span>obligation under the Deed of
Assignment, Exhibit C, and not other agreements between <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
and the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention was upheld
by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, we believe is
the correct construction of the surety bonds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the surety bonds, <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> and Luzon
bound themselves to the plaintiff in the sum of P100,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It recited that the principal, <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>, and Luzon bound themselves jointly and severally
to the PNB under the following conditions:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that ‘in consideration of a certain loan, <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
executed a Deed of Assignment in favor of the PNB on all payments to be
received by him from the Bureau of Public Works in connection with a contract
of August 6, 1956’; that the PNB required the principal to give a good and
sufficient bond to secure the full and faithful performance on his part of said
agreement; and that, ‘if the principal shall well and truly perform and fulfill
all the undertakings, covenants, terms and conditions, and agreements
stipulated in said agreement, this obligation shall be null and void’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, what are the undertakings, covenants,
terms, conditions, and agreements stipulated in the said agreement or Deed of
Assignment?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The undertakings of the
principal <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>, under the Deed of Assignment,
Exhibit C, were to assign, transfer, and convey to the plaintiff bank all
payments to be received by <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> from the Bureau of
Public Works; that <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> acknowledged that such <span style="">sums </span>assigned and received by the
plaintiff would belong to the PNB, and if any conversion should be made by the
assignor or his representative, he would be criminally liable; that the PNB
could collect and receive all sums and monies, and payments, and the bank was
authorized to endorse for deposit or for encashment all checks or money orders,
or negotiable instruments that it might receive in connection with the
assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the Deed of
Assignment nor in the bonds did Luzon guarantee that <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
would pay his indebtedness to the plaintiff and that upon <span class="SpellE">Depusoy's</span>
default, Luzon would be liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
terms of the agreement are clear, there can be no room for construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the intention of the parties, and
particularly of Luzon, was to guarantee the payment of the debt of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> to the plaintiff, the bonds would have recited in
its preamble that the principal was indebted to the PNB and that the PNB
required the principal to give a good and sufficient bond to secure the
faithful performance on his part of the terms of the promissory notes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of doing so, it recited that in
consideration of a certain loan, the principal had executed a Deed of
Assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recital of the loan in
the amount of P40,000.00, Exhibit D and P60,000.00, Exhibit E, is merely a
statement of the cause or consideration of the Deed of Assignment and not a
statement of the obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Deed of
Assignment necessarily was executed for a consideration, otherwise, it would be
null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obligation recited in
the surety bonds, Exhibits D and E, is not the loan, but the Deed of
Assignment; and that precisely was what was guaranteed by <st1:place>Luzon</st1:place>
in the bonds, Exhibits D and E, as shown by the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(TSN, pp.
27-29 June 1, 1959)</blockquote>

<blockquote>In support of his contention that the surety bond was intended to
guarantee the loan, the appellant gave the following grounds or reasons:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of the Board of Directors of
the plaintiff approving the loan or credit accommodation to <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
required that <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> should put up a bond executed
by the Luzon Surety Company, Inc., Exhibits K-3, K-4 and K-5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolutions of the Board of Directors
were unilateral acts of the plaintiff and were conditions imposed upon the
debtor, <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Luzon was not a party to these resolutions and under the rule of <span class="SpellE">res</span> inter <span class="SpellE">alios</span> <span class="SpellE">acta</span>, they cannot bind or prejudice Luzon in the absence of
evidence that the terms of the resolutions had been brought to the attention of
Luzon and that it had acceded thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that the bond stated is that the PNB required the principal to give
a good and sufficient bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be
no other consideration for the execution of the bonds other than stated thereon
in the absence of allegation that they did not express <span style="">the true </span>intention of the parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant contends that the promissory notes
and the building contract mentioned in the Deed of Assignment became part and
parcel of the Deed of Assignment under the principle of incorporation by
reference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree that the Deed of
Assignment became part and parcel of the bond, but to say that all promissory
notes, overdrafts, and any other kind of documents which the PNB might require
the assignor to execute to evidence the aforementioned obligation were also
incorporated by reference to the surety bond and became obligation of Luzon is
to include in the assignment, covenants and obligations beyond the
contemplation of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant relies on the last paragraph of the Deed of Assignment which
reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'This assignment shall be
irrevocable and subject to the terms and conditions of the promissory notes,
overdrafts, and any other kind of document which the PNB can require or may
require the assignor to execute to evidence the above-mentioned obligation'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is argued that under this stipulation, Luzon guaranteed the
payment of the promissory notes which are the subject of this action and also
the building contract between <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>, its principal,
and the Bureau of Public Works.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
a very far-fetched construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
paragraph does not impose any obligation upon <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that was required of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
was to execute such documents which might be required by the PNB to evidence
the Deed of Assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The words of the
phrase 'subject to' are words of qualification and not of contract (Cox vs. Vat
149, 110 pp. 96-148 CCH 147) and means subject to, meaning under the control,
power or dominion or subordinate to and not being words of contract imposing
upon defendant no contractual obligation (40 Words &amp; Phrases 386-389).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was evidently intended is the Deed of
Assignment when it stated 'subject to the terms and conditions of the
promissory notes and overdrafts' was that any amount received by the PNB would
be applied to the payment of the promissory notes and overdrafts in accordance
with their terms and conditions as they fell due because the Deed of Assignment
was executed not for the purpose of making the PNB the owner of all the monies
received from the GSIS, but as a security for the payment of the debt <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
arising from the credit accommodation granted to him by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that this was the intention is evident
from the fact that upon receipt of the treasury warrants and checks from the
GSIS, the appellant applied the same to the payment of the debt of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> which was due with interest and the remainder was
credited to <span class="SpellE">Depusoy's</span> current account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This balance was subject to the free disposal
of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, out of the over P1 million received by the Loans &amp; Discounts
Department of the appellant, almost P800,000.00 were credited to the current account
of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> and only a little over P200,000.00 was
applied to his debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant contends
that since in the Deed of Assignment, <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
undertook to assign, transfer, and convey to PNB all payments to be received by
him from his contract with the Bureau of Public Works, Luzon had thereby
guaranteed the faithful performance by <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> of his
building contract with the Bureau of Public Works, and <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
having defaulted in his building contract by reason of which the Bureau of
Public Works rescinded the building contract, the PNB did not receive from the
GSIS the full contract price of over P2 million.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This indeed is a very far-fetched
construction of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
transferred or assigned by <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> to the PNB were
all payments to be received by him under the contract with the Bureau of Public
Works.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, what was to be
received by <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> depends upon his performance
under the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as he
faithfully performed the contract, he would receive from the GSIS the amount
due him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the moment he defaulted
and failed to comply with the terms of the contract, he would receive nothing
and he could not assign what he did not have.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To argue that under the terms of the Deed of Assignment, Luzon also
guaranteed the faithful performance of the building contract of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> with the Bureau of Public Works is fanciful and
wishful thinking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) Appellant also
contends that under Exhibits F and I, it can be seen that what was really
intended to be guaranteed by the surety agreement was the payment of the
loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We quote Exhibits F and I.</blockquote>

honor to inform you that we are agreeable to the extension of further credit to

<blockquote>At first glance, from the statement in Exhibit F, which reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'This bond also covers the new accommodation
given our principal', and in Exhibit I, that 'we are agreeable to the extension
of further credit to or principal to the extent of the amount of the said
bond', it would appear that Luzon was referring to the obligation of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> to pay the loan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But particular attention must be paid to the statement in Exhibit F that
'all of the terms and conditions of our above-mentioned bonds shall remain the
same except the period of expiration <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span>
mentioned'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was really agreed by
Luzon was the extension of the duration of the surety bond, for under the terms
of the bonds they expired six months from their respective dates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any statement in Exhibit I that may be
construed as referring to the debt of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> was
made only by an Asst. Manager who evidently was not familiar with the terms of
the surety bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that
the surety bond was executed by CS Rodriguez, General Manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it cannot prevail over the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Santiago, Manager of the Loans
&amp; Discounts Department, that what was guaranteed by the surety bond was the
Deed of Assignment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is also contended that if what was intended to be guaranteed by
Luzon is the Deed of Assignment, the surety bond guaranteed nothing, because
with the execution of the Deed of Assignment, nothing thereafter remained to be
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not true, for the terms of
the Deed of Assignment, <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> authorized the PNB to
receive all monies due from the Bureau of Public Works and to endorse for
deposit all instruments of credit that might be issued in connection with the
payments therein assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under this
stipulation, Luzon guaranteed that all the monies due <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
under his building contract with the Bureau <span style="">of </span>Public Works should be paid to the PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that all the checks and warrants
issued by the GSIS were to be made payable to the PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But under the arrangement between the PNB,
GSIS, and the Bureau of Public Works, and <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>, it
was<i> </i><span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> who received the warrants or
checks either from the Bureau of Public Works or from the GSIS, and <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> delivered the same to the PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PNB did not take the trouble of going to
the GSIS or the Bureau of Public Works to get the checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One reason because the PNB did not know when
any amount would be due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
nothing then that could prevent an arrangement thereafter between <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> and the GSIS, or the Bureau of Public Works to make
the checks payable to <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> from forging the signature of the PNB and appropriating
the money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would be a violation of
the Deed of Assignment for which Luzon would be liable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is not disputed that no payment was made directly to <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> after the Deed of Assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All amounts due to <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
were paid to the PNB for the account of <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that in accordance with Exhibit M,
only P1,063,408.91 were received by the Loans and Discounts Department of the
plaintiff bank, and that of the total amount of P1,309,461.89 paid by the GSIS,
P246,062.98 were paid for the importation of construction materials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the so-called 10% retention fund, there
is no evidence that the Bureau of Public Works had retained any amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case what was assigned was ‘all
payments to be received’ under the building contract, and the 10% retention was
not to be received by <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> until certain
conditions had been met.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In its eight assignment of error, the appellant contends that the
lower court in not admitting proof of the amount actually received by the PNB
and the letter of the GSIS, Exhibit Q (sic).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from the purely technical reason for their rejection, their
admission cannot affect the result.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibit Q is a letter of the General Manager of the GSIS to plaintiff
advising plaintiff of the rescission of the building contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibits Q, P, P-1 and P-2 are statements of
the amounts received by plaintiff's foreign department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence that the GSIS had paid
any amount to <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span> in violation of the Deed of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><u>La</u> <u><span style="">Insular</span></u><span style=""> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Machuca</u></span> </span><u>Go</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Tanco</span></u></span><u><span style="">,</span></u><span style=""> <u>e</u></span><u><span style="">t</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">al.</span></u><span style="">, <u>supra.</u>,
this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is undoubtedly true that the law looks upon the contract
of <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span> with a jealous eye, and the rule is
settled that the obligations of the surety cannot be extended by implication
beyond its specified limits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Article 1827 of the Civil Code so discloses (<span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aloc</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Cho</span> Jan Ling, 27
Phil. Rep., 427); and with this doctrine the common law is accordant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was said by Justice Story in Miller vs.
Stewart (9 Wheat, 680; 6 L. ed., 189):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'Nothing can be clearer,
both upon principles and authority, than the doctrine that the liability of a
surety is not to be extended, by implication, beyond the terms of his
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent and in the
manner, and under the circumstances pointed out in his obligation, he is bound,
and no farther."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier adverted to, there is merit in the third assigned
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The paragraph immediately
preceding the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion of the decision of
respondent Court of Appeals reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"We agree with the appellant that the trial court erred in not
sentencing <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Depusoy</span>
to pay attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the amount due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is expressly provided for in the
promissory notes, and as it does not appear to be unreasonable, the stipulation
of the parties should be given effect."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
questioned decision should then be modified in the sense that the "10%
interest” indicated therein should be considered and understood as and for
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the above modification, the Decision of
the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals of 12
December 1970 in C.A.-G.R. No. 36615-R is AFFIRMED, with costs against
petitioner.</p>
