<p class="BODY">The prosecution narrated the tragic incident as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On February 26, 1976 at about 2:45 o'clock in the afternoon,
while the deceased Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>, his wife <span class="SpellE">Purificacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nidea-Torrero</span>,
mother-in-law Maria <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span>, friend <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> and a child <span class="SpellE">Francia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tresvalles</span>, were passing
by the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Muit</span>
at barrio <span class="SpellE">Tamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tinambac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, on their way
home from a picnic, the accused invited them to his house to take a rest (pp.
42, 44 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="9">Sept.
 6, 1976</st1:date>; p. 130 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="9">Sept. 9, 1976</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time <span class="SpellE">Muit</span>
was alone as his wife and children were not around (pp. 5 &amp; 24, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="10">Oct. 24,
 1977</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once the group was
inside his house, accused <span class="SpellE">Muit</span> who is a retired PC
lieutenant remarked that his invitation showed that he had no ill-feel­ing
against the <span class="SpellE">Torreros</span> and that he knew the latter had
no ill-feeling also against him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">(p. </span>5,
<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Sept. 6, 1976; p. 131, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
Sept. 9, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As they engaged in some
amenities, a group of <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> members and PC
authorities in charge of the sanitation and cleanli­ness program on that
particular day, which was Community Day, paid them a visit, and after a short
talk, said group left (p. 57, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Sept. 6,
1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deceased <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>
conducted the group on their way out and upon his return, accused <span class="SpellE">Muit</span> requested him to take a seat (p.58, <i>id</i>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused then confronted Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>
why <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the latter </span>always visits his
wife even during nighttime and why he often invites her out. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> replied that
being the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> zone auditor, he had to confer
with the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> wife on <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
matters as the latter was the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> zone president
(pp. 135-136, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="9">Sept. 9, 1976</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused then asked why <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> even gave food and money
to his (<span class="SpellE">accused's</span>) children if he had no bad
intention at all on his wife (<i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Torrero's</span> wife answered that they did it out
of pity because there were times when they would see the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
children in need of food and money (<i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused, however, angrily stood up and
countered, 'Why should you give when your husband had also a family to
support?' (p. 138, <i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To avoid
any trouble, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> likewise stood up
and said, 'If that is the way we talked about this will end to nothing, so it
is better that I should leave' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(p. </span>139,
<i>id.</i>), and he proceeded to move out of the house (<i>id.</i>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>When <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> was already outside the
house of the accused and while walking along the pathway, the accused followed
him and on reaching the door the accused shouted, 'Wait because we have not yet
finished'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that instant, the accused
raised his left hand to­wards <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> and with his
right hand, he pulled out his .45 caliber pistol and aimed it at the deceased
(pp. 140­-141, <i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Angrily, he
fired his gun at <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> who was just 3 1/2 meters
away, hitting the latter at the lower left side below the nape (pp. 22-24,
&amp; 44, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Sept. 6 &amp; 9, 1976; Necrop­sy
Report, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A', Rec.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On being hit by the bullet, <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> spun from his left to the right, with his two hands
inclined to the right, his face writhing in pain, his left elbow raised
parallel to his armpit and his right hand placed on his breast (pp. 65-66, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="9">Sept. 6, 1976</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon hearing the gunshot, witness <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span>
immediately grab­bed and held the accused from be­hind with an embrace, and
said, '<span class="SpellE">Manoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>, why
are you like that?' (pp. 63-64, <i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But as soon as <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> embraced the accused
from behind, a second shot was fired, this time hitting the elevated left hand
of <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>, with the bullet penetrating through the
breast <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(pp. </span>11-12, &amp; 88, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">id.;</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt"> </span>Necropsy Report, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A',
Rec.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>
fell on his knees, bent forward with face downward and body in a prone position
his left elbow supporting him on his left lap while his right hand extended to
the ground <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(p. </span>145, <span class="SpellE">tns</span>., Sept. 9, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> on the other hand tightened
his grip around the accused as he tried to wrestle with him (p. 67, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Sept. 6, 1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The wife of <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>, who was shocked by
the first shot thereupon rushed towards her fallen husband (p. 143, 145-146, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Sept. 9, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the accused on seeing Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> rushed
towards the deceased, aimed his gun at her (p. 68, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
Sept. 6, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, witness <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> quickly grabbed the right forearm of the accused
that held the gun and jerked it upward so that the third shot was fired towards
the sky, thus missing its target (<i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> then said, '<span class="SpellE">Manoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>, that is enough' (<i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> thereafter
moved the accused away and brought him near a coconut tree (<i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>, on
the other hand, hugged her husband and cried for help, even as blood was oozing
out from the deceased's body and mouth <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(pp.
</span>67, 146-147, <i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly
thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> died (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'B', Rec.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Near the coconut tree, the accused tried to free himself from the
hold of <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">He even </span>pointed his gun
at <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> and said, 'Set me free Benny or I will
shoot you.' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(p. </span>69, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Sept. 6, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> could no longer hold the accused
as the latter kept on struggling, he let him go and said, 'Alright <span class="SpellE">Kuya</span> <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span>, shoot me, after all
I have no fault' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(pp. </span>69-70, <i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Slowly, the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">put down his arm, his eyes at static condition (<i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He (appel­lant) then started to move away,
and as he did, he made a short last look at his victim, after which, he
continued on his way (<i>id.</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The evidence discloses
that the accused </span>surrendered himself and turned in the pistol he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">had used to the Detachment Commander of the <span class="SpellE">Tamban</span> </span>Police Patrol Base soon after the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the other hand, the
defense presented this </span>version:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> At
about 2:45 p.m., 26 February 1976, the late Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>,
accompanied by his wife, <span class="SpellE">Purificacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Nidea-Torrero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span>, Frances <span class="SpellE">Tresvalles</span>, and
his mother, Maria <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span>, had come from a picnic
(it was a Sunday), when they passed by the house of <span class="SpellE">Muit</span>
(in barrio <span class="SpellE">Tamban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tinambac</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Muit</span> was at the
door of his house, because he was about to leave to visit his farm and had
tucked his 45-caliber pistol in his front waistline, under his T-shirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Muit</span> invited <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> and his companions to drop by.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The invi­tation was accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Muit</span> was alone in
his house, because his wife and children were in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
at that time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the usual amenities between host and guests, another group,
which was conducting an inspection of the houses in the zone in connect­ion
with community activities, arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
second group soon left, and <span class="SpellE">Muit</span> and the group of <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> resumed their conversation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> was carrying a bolo which was
slung in its scabbard and was hanging from his right shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was left-handed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the conversation was resumed, <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>
took offense at what <span class="SpellE">Muit</span> brought up and, in a huff,
stood up and walked toward the door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Muit</span> followed him, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">asking
<span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> not to leave, then a shot was fired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other shots - the number is <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> - were fired and <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>
fell.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> embraced <span class="SpellE">Muit</span>
from behind before or after -- this is also controversial -- the second shot.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> suffered from 3 gunshot
wounds:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) on the left arm; 2) on the
chest, the fatal one, the bullet entering from the front and exiting at the
back; and 3) a superficial one on the nape.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These wounds were inflicted by shots fired from the .45-caliber pistol
licensed in the name of <span class="SpellE">Muit</span> as a retired PC second
lieutenant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first shot, deliberately
fired by <span class="SpellE">Muit</span>, hit <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span>
on the left arm; the second shot, fired while the gun was still held by <span class="SpellE">Muit</span>, hit <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> on the chest;
while the third wound was obviously inflicted last, although none of the
witnesses could tell the precise moment of its infliction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was, however, the opi­nion of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Froyalde</span> (TSN-trial of 6 Sept. 1976, p. 23) that this wound
was inflicted when <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> was already lying on the
ground.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The bolo of <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> was already drawn
from its scabbard when the sketch of the scene was drawn by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Darilay</span>, minutes after the shooting, and was also shown in
the photographs taken of the body of <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> where it
fell (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 1, 1-B &amp; 1-C).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">was also confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> (TSN-trial of 6
Sept. 1976, p. 79), and by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> (TSN-trial of
9 Sept. 1976, p. 159).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Muit</span> did not get near the body of <span class="SpellE">Torrero</span> after the latter fell, but immediately proceeded to
the PC detachment to surrender himself and his gun.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:

principal witness (<span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span>)

Evangelista was to testify on the alleged illicit relations between prosecution

Mrs. Evangelista, formerly the victim's wife, who remarried after she was
widowed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Trial Court denied
reopening on the ground that even assuming such liaison, it had happened in
1977 whereas <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> had submitted himself as
government witness as early as March 4,1976, besides the fact that it would not
prove bias on the part of <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span>, who was an

<p class="BODY">The appealed Decision sufficiently meets that standard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the Trial Court is substantiated

purchase of railroad ties; that he had witnessed the shooting incident from a

immediately after; that he never mentioned the incident to the authorities, nor
did he approach the accused after the incident, is unnatural behavior and does
not inspire belief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having gone

casts doubt as to their presence near the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their version was unconvincing compared to
the forthright testimonies of the prosecution wit­nesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the appraisal by a Trial Court of
the credibility of witnesses is entitled to the greatest respect in the absence
of established exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense faults the Trial Court for having violated the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> right to remain silent in that the Court took
against the latter his failure to report to the Detachment Commander at the
time of his surrender his plea of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What the Trial Judge did, however, was merely to draw an inference from
the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> failure to volunteer that information,
which would have been the most natural reaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It
should also be noted that the accused was neither under investigation nor
interrogation so that his right against self-incrimination was never
endangered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged bias of the Trial Judge against the accused is
without basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span>
questions propounded by him during the trial were intended to test the
credibility of witnesses and to extract the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the Trial Judge had ordered the accused
transferred to <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span> after conviction is no manifestation
of bias considering that this Tribunal had upheld said action in its Resolution

<p class="BODY">3. The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> plea of self-defense and

that the first shot, which he had deliberately fired, hit the victim on his
left arm; that the fatal second shot which hit the victim on his chest, was
fired accidentally as a direct consequence of <span class="SpellE">Gubatan's</span>
embracing the accused from behind; while the third shot hit the victim at the
nape of the neck when the victim was already prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">That was not the sequence of the occurrence as established by the
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim did not try to hack
the accused with his (victim's) bolo that hung from his right shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no reason for him to physically

victim's side out of its scabbard is no proof that the victim had used it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must have dropped as the accused fell to
the ground after having been hit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What
is established by the evidence is that the victim was hit by a bullet at the
nape or back portion of the neck at the first shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim <span class="SpellE">spinned</span>
around from left to right involuntarily, at which point he was hit by the
second shot on the left arm and on his chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The third shot did not hit its mark as it was deflected upward by <span class="SpellE">Gubatan</span> who jerked the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
hand skyward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, therefore, the
accused had treacherously shot the victim at the back thereby disproving the
element of unlawful aggression on the victim's part, which the defense seeks to
establish as an essential element of self-defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
