respective two-storey houses were only two to three meters apart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused started to court Stephanie in
early 1984, but she refused to be his girlfriend [TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1987</st1:date>, p. 2.]</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the prosecution, on <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1984</st1:date><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a>, at about
<st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning,
Stephanie was awakened from her sleep and felt the presence of someone inside
her bedroom (a room she shared with her mother) located on the second floor of
the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was about to scream when
the accused covered her mouth with his right hand and pointed a knife at
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite her resistance, the accused
succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having accomplished what he came for, the
accused stood up, put on his briefs and left through the <span class="SpellE">ungrilled</span>
window of the room from which three slats of glass jalousies had been earlier
removed by him to gain entry into the room [TSN, May 20, 1985, pp. 4-8; TSN,
June 11, 1985, pp. 14-25.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately thereafter, Stephanie transferred to her younger
brothersâ€™ room and cried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not
tell anyone about the incident until August 26, 1984 when her mother came home
from work for the week.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(During the

day.) Stephanie and her mother reported the incident to the police and she,
thereafter, submitted herself to a medical examination by Dr. Alberto M. Reyes
of the National Bureau of Investigation [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1985</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pp. </span>8-16;

5-11.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Reyes testified and submitted a report concluding that
although there were genital findings compatible with sexual intercourse with a
man on or about the alleged date of commission, there was no evident sign of <span class="SpellE">extragenital</span> physical injuries noted on Stephanie at the
time of examination [Exhibit "D".]</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense sought to establish the innocence
of the accused by proving that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>and
Stephanie were sweethearts and that, by mutual consent, they developed a
sexually intimate relationship. </p>

<p class="BODY">Accused claimed that soon after Stephanie accepted his offer of
love on <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stephanie suggested to Bernard that since her
mother infrequently went home from work, they should see each other in her
bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stephanie told him that she
would remove three slats of the <span class="SpellE">ungrilled</span> jalousie
window <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so </span>that he could enter
the room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused agreed to the
plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on four subsequent
occasions, the accused climbed into Stephanie's room at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, and the couple would spend about <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an hour </span>talking and caressing each
other [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1985</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1984</st1:date>,
the accused and Stephanie had sexual intercourse for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On two more occasions, August 13 and 15, the
accused returned to her room and the young lovers made love [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1985</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pp. </span>22-24; TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1985</st1:date>, pp. 9-10.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In the early morning of the 18th of August, as Bernard once again
entered her room, Stephanie warned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">him
that her maid was </span>sleeping in the room with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
he was about </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">leave, the </span>maid
woke up and turned on the lights of the room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The maid asked him what he was doing and he revealed that he was there
at Stephanie's invitation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused
then hurriedly left the room [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="10">October

<p class="BODY">In the review of the evidence presented in the case, this Court
was guided by three established principles, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) an accusation for rape can be made with
facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the person accused,
though innocent to disprove; (2) in view of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons
are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with
extreme caution; and, (3) the evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for
</span>the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be
allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense

<p class="BODY">For while it is undeniable that rape is a most detestable crime
and therefore, its perpetrators should be severely and impartially punished,
the testimony of the alleged victim should not be accorded unquestioning
acceptance by the courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidentiary rule is that in crimes against chastity "when the conviction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">depends on </span>any vital point upon her
(the alleged victim's) uncorroborated testimony, it should not be accepted
unless her sincerity and candor are free from suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A little insight into human nature is of most
value in judging matters of this kind" [People v. <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>.

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing principles and after a painstaking
study of the evidence on record, the Court finds that the prosecution has
failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="NUM">A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The uncorroborated
testimony of the alleged victim as to the manner by which the accused allegedly
overpowered and violated her through force and intimidation does not inspire
belief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stephanie testified that soon after she detected his presence in
the room, the accused covered her mouth with his right hand to prevent her from
screaming or shouting for help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused held in his left hand a knife and poked it at her waist, instilling
fear in her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused allegedly
twisted her right hand behind her back and forced her down the bed by pulling
her feet with his left hand, and pressed the weight of his body against
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, she struggled by
kicking his legs and moving her body (torso) from side to side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused however held down her feet with
his left hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also with the use of his
left hand, the accused stripped off her pajama pants and panty, as well as his
briefs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But because of the effort she
made to try to free herself, the accused was unable to strip off her pajama
top.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, despite her efforts
at swaying her torso from side to side and keeping her legs together, the
accused succeeded in parting her thighs with his legs and feet and penetrated
her without the aid of his hands [TSN, May 20, 1985, pp<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">. </span>4-20; June 11, 1985, pp. 13-23; June 13, 1985, pp. 3-25.]</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that Stephanie categorically declared <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>several occasions that the accused
never took away his right hand from her mouth, thus preventing her from
screaming for help nor loosened the grip of his left hand on his knife poised
at her right side until after he had raped her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">[<u>See</u> </span>TSN, June 11, 1985. pp. 21-25; TSN, June 13, 1985.
pp. 9-16. 22-25.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Testimony to be believed must not only proceed from a credible
witness, but must itself be credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
better test has yet been found to determine the value of the testimony of a
witness than its conformity to the knowledge and common experience of mankind
[People v. <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>, G.R. No. L-20153. <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1967</st1:date>, 20 SCRA 451; People v.
<span class="SpellE">Peruelo</span>, G.R. No. 50631, <st1:date year="1981" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1981</st1:date>, 105 SCRA 226.] Considering the
degree of resistance the alleged victim purportedly made <u>and</u> the very
peculiar position assumed by the accused all throughout the incident, i.e. his
body pressed down on the left side of her body, his right hand covering her
mouth and his left hand holding a knife at her side (notably the same hand
which was used to unclothe her, to remove his briefs and to hold her feet
down), the Court finds incredible the claim that the accused was able to
penetrate her as she described [People v. <span class="SpellE">Apari</span>, G.R.
No. L-28323, <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1982</st1:date>.
114 SCRA 620; People v. <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span>, G.R. No. 74352, <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1989</st1:date>.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unless the accused were an adept
contortionist of extraordinary strength and virility, which he was not shown to
be, or the alleged victim were paralyzed with fear, which her testimonies on
direct and cross examination refute, Stephanie's version of the incident fails
the test of common knowledge and experience.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Stephanie's admission that she did not use her
unrestrained left arm and hand either to pull the hair of the accused or to box
him when he mounted her [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="6">June 13,
 1985</st1:date>, pp. 10-19] betrays a significant inconsistency in her
testimony. </p>

<p class="BODY">Stephanie testified that the accused neither held nor pinned down
her left arm and hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet she admitted
that she only used her left arm and hand to ward off the accused as he was
pressing her down on the bed and removing her pan<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">t</span>s and panty (TSN, June 13, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">1985, </span>pp. 10-19.] She claimed that she ceased using her left arm
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">hand </span>to fight the accused
because <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">she feared </span>that he would
harm her with his knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this
explanation is not consistent with her claim that she unwaveringly struggled
and fought the accused by kicking his feet and legs, and by swaying her torso
from side to side, even as he penetrated her and notwithstanding the knife
pointed at her side [TSN, May 20, 1985, pp. 4-7; TSN, June 13, 1985, pp. 6-19,
23-24.] At any rate, this ine<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">x</span>plicable
inconsistency casts serious doubt on the veracity of the alleged victim's
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, Stephanie's conduct after the alleged rape incident does
not correspond with the normal reaction of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">a </span>victim of this hideous crime.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the one hand, Stephanie testified that because the accused
threatened her, she did not shout or scream for help even after the accused,
left her room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She merely left her room
and transferred to her younger brothers' room and cried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not attempt to get in touch with her
mother while the latter was away at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">work;
she reasoned </span>that she was afraid to leave her house because the accused
warned her not to reveal what had happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither did she bother to tell her uncle, Arnold Perez, who was then
staying with her family, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">her </span>brothers
and close friends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only time she
informed anyone of the incident was when her mother arrived from work a week
later [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1985</st1:date>,
pp. 3-11.]</p>

<p class="BODY">But on the other hand, she admitted that on the evening following
the day she was allegedly raped, she slept once again in her bedroom <u>alone</u>
[TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1985</st1:date>, pp.
27-31.]</p>

<p class="BODY">If indeed Stephanie were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a
</span>victim of rape through force and intimidation, why would she continue to
sleep alone in the very same room where she was forcibly violated?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The normal reaction of a thirteen (13) year
old victim, especially one who had not confided to anyone that she was raped,
would have been to avoid that room which would remind her of the disturbing
incident and trigger overwhelming fright and confusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On rebuttal, Stephanie and her maid <span class="SpellE">Joela</span>
<span class="SpellE">Almonte</span> testified that the accused returned to
Stephanie's room in the early morning of <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1984</st1:date>; but this time <span class="SpellE">Joela</span>
or "Ella" (who had just arrived from the province the day before) was
also in the room.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Joela</span> testified that she was awakened
by the presence of somebody else in the room and switched on the lights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She saw the accused inside the room standing
by the window while Stephanie was sitting in a corner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Joela</span> demanded to
know what he was doing there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she
went downstairs to get help from the uncle of Stephanie but he was not in the
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the accused hurriedly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cl</span>imbed out of the room through the
same window he had used on <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="8">August 19,
 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Joela</span> returned to the room, she found Stephanie
crying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, both of them fell
back to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next day, when
Stephanie's mother arrived, she told her what happened [TSN, <span class="SpellE">Joela</span> <span class="SpellE">Almonte</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1987</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="NUM">B. For its part, the defense presented as witnesses Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldana</span>, mother of the
accused, and Mrs. Josefina <span class="SpellE">Guadarama</span>, a friend of the
<span class="SpellE">Aldana</span> family and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">an acquaintance </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Mrs.
Ofelia Hutchison.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both ladies </span>testified
that on <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1985</st1:date>, they
went <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to </span>the house of Mrs.
Hutchison with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>primary
purpose of convincing the latter to withdraw the case against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Hutchison however refused to agree and
revealed that she was mad at the parents of the accused, specifically his father,
and had in fact made it appear that the accused threatened Stephanie with a
knife so as to make the charge graver [TSN, E. <span class="SpellE">Aldana</span>,
February 11, 1986, pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">9</span>-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">14; TSN, J. </span><span class="SpellE">Guadarama</span>;
December 8, 1986, pp. 5-8.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court regarded their testimonies an implied admission
of guilt [RTC Decision, pp. 17-18; Records, pp. 49-50.] The Court must
disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This presumption does not
arise in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">It </span>is clear from the testimonies of
these two witnesses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that they </span>had
sought to persuade Mrs. Hutchison to withdraw the case because they knew that
the youngsters were sweethearts and they believed that the accused was innocent
of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, their testimonies were not refuted by the
prosecution, not even by Mrs. Hutchison when she was presented on rebuttal
[TSN, O, Hutchison, <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1987</st1:date>.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Gorobat</span> was also presented
as a defense witness to bolster the testimony of the accused that Stephanie
came to visit him in the early mornings of October 17 and 19, 1984, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 o'clock</st1:time>, after her mother had filed a
complaint against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused
stated that Stephanie went to his house and confided to him that it was her
mother who forced her to say that he had raped her (TSN, October 7, 1985, pp.
25-27.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On direct and cross examination, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Gorobat</span>
testified that while passing through the alleyway outside the <span class="SpellE">Aldana</span> house on the aforementioned dates, he saw Stephanie
and Bernard seated side by side in the latter's terrace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further claimed that when the accused saw
him, the former <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">waved </span>at him to
go away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was candid enough to admit
that he did not hear them conversing [TSN, <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1986</st1:date>, pp. 2-14.]</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no cogent reason to doubt the sincerity of the
witness, the Court finds that the foregoing testimony renders more doubtful the
veracity of Stephanie's claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A victim
of rape would not voluntarily meet with her alleged rapist, much less sit
beside him in his terrace unescorted at <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, to support the theory that the youngsters were
sweethearts, that they had met on several occasions in her room, and that they
were keeping their relationship a secret because Stephanie feared the anger of
her mother, the defense submitted in evidence two pictures and various letters
and notes sent by Stephanie to Bernard.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top:12.0pt">The accused testified that when they
were still friends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stephanie had sent
him two pictures of herself on <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="4">April
 21, 1982</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="1">January 23,

<p class="BODY">In April 1984, when the accused started writing love letters to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">her, </span>Stephanie, using her nickname
"Apple", wrote him a letter dated April 15, 1984, the contents of
which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">While the Court generally desists from disturbing the findings of
the trial court, considering that the latter is in a better position to pass
upon the matter of credibility of witnesses, the Court will not hesitate to
take exception to this rule in order to keep faith with the principle that
every criminal conviction must be supported by proof beyond reasonable doubt
