Regional Trial Court of Roxas City, Branch 18, in Civil Case No. V-5146
entitled "Natividad Bito-on Deita, et al. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">vs. </span>Graciano Bernas." As disclosed by the records and the
evidence of both parties, the facts involved in the controversy are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Natividad Bito-on Deita is the owner of Lots Nos. 794, 801, 840
and 848 of the Cadastral Survey of Panay, Capiz, with a total area of 5,831
square meters.  Out of liberality,
Natividad entrusted the lots by way of "dugo" to her brother, Benigno
Bito-on, so that he could use the fruits thereof to defray the cost of
financing his children's schooling in Manila.  Prior to April 1978, these agricultural lots had been leased by one
Anselmo Billones but following the latter's death and consequent termination of
the lease, petitioner Graciano Bernas took over and worked on the land.  Benigno and Bernas worked out a
production-sharing arrangement whereby the first provided for all the expenses
and the second worked the land, and after harvest, the two (2) deducted said
expenses and divided the balance of the harvest between the two of them.  The owner, Natividad, played no part in this
arrangement as she was not privy to the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1985, the lots were returned by Benigno to his sister
Natividad, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">all </span>his children had by
then finished their schooling.  When
Natividad and her husband sought to take over possession of the lots, Bernas
refused to relinquish, claiming that he was an agricultural leasehold lessee
instituted on the land by Benigno and, as such, he is entitled to security of
tenure under the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Faced with this opposition from Bernas, Natividad filed an action
with the Regional Trial Court for Recovery of Possession, Ownership and
Injunction with Damages.  After trial,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> held in favor of the defendant (Bernas) and
dismissed the complaint, ruling that from the record and the evidence
presented, notably the testimony of the plaintiff's own brother Benigno, Bernas
was indeed a leasehold tenant under the provisions of Republic Act No. 1199 and
an agricultural leasehold lessee under Republic Act No. 3844, having been so
instituted by the usufructuary of the land (Benigno).  As such, according to the trial court, his tenurial rights cannot
be disturbed save for causes provided by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved, the plaintiff (Natividad) appealed to the Court of
Appeals, contending that the "dugo" arrangement between her and her
brother Benigno was not in the nature of a usufruct (as held by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>), but actually a contract of <u>commodatum</u>.  This being the case, Benigno, the bailee in
the <u>commodatum</u>, could neither lend nor lease the properties loaned, to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>third
person, as such relationship <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(of </span>bailor-bailee)
is one of personal character.  This
time, her contentions were sustained, with the respondent appel­late court
reversing the trial court's decision, ruling that having only derived his
rights from the usufructuary/bailee, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bernas
had no better right to the </span>property than the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who admittedly was entrusted with the
property only for a limited period.  Further, according to the appellate court, there being no privity of
contract </span>between Natividad and Bernas, the former cannot be expected to
be bound by or to honor the relationship or tie between Benigno and the latter
(Bernas).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition by Bernas.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue for resolution by the Court is concisely stated by the
respondent appellate court as follows:   whether the agricultural leasehold established by Benigno Bito-on
in favor of Graciano Bernas is binding upon the owner of the land, Natividad
Bito-on, who disclaims any knowledge of, or participation in the same.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In ruling for the private respondent (Natividad), the respondent
appellate court held that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Indeed, no evidence has been adduced to clarify the nature of
the 'dugo' transaction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">between
plaintiff and her brother Benigno </span>Bito-on.  What seems apparent is that Benigno Bito-on was gratuitously
allowed to utilize the land to help him in financing the schooling of his
children.  Whether the transaction is
one of usufruct, which right may be leased or alienated, or one of <u>commodatum</u>,
which is purely personal in character, the beneficiary has the obligation to
return the property upon the expiration of the period stipulated, or
accomplishment of the purpose for which it was constituted (Art. 612, Art.
1946, Civil Code).  Accordingly, it is
believed that one who derives his right from the usufructuary/bailee, cannot
refuse to return the property upon the expiration of the contract.  In this case, Benigno Bito-on returned the
property lent to him on May 13, 1985 to the owners, the plaintiff herein.  We do not see how the defendant can have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>better
right to the property than Benigno Bito-on, who admittedly possessed the land <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">for a limited period.  There is no privity of contract between the
owner of the land and the cultivator."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At this point, it is appropriate to point out that, contrary to
the appreciation of the respondent appellate court, the general law on property
and contracts, embodied in the Civil Code of the Philippines, finds no
principal application in the present conflict.  <u>Generalibus</u> <u>specialia</u> <u>derogant</u>.  The environmental facts of the case at bar
indicate that this is not a mere case of recovery of ownership or possession of
property.  Had this been so, then the
Court would have peremptorily dismissed the present petition.  The fact, however, that cultivated
agricultural land is involved suffices for the Court to pause and review the
legislation directly relevant and applicable at the time this controversy
arose.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, it would appear that Republic Act No. 1199,
invoked by the trial court, had already been rendered inoperative by the
passage of Republic Act No. 3844, as amended, otherwise known as the
Agricultural Land Reform Code (Code, for brevity).  The former, also known as the Agricultural Tenancy Act of the
Philippines and approved in August 1954 had sought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>establish <u>a system of agricultural tenancy relations between
the tenant and the landholder</u>, defining two (2) systems of agricultural
tenancy:   the share and the leasehold
tenancy.  At this point, however,
further discussion of the foregoing would appear futile, for the Code, enacted
in August 1963, had expressly declared agricultural share tenancy to be
contrary to public policy and abolished the same.  As for leasehold tenancy relations entered into prior to the
effectivity of the Code, the rights and obligations arising therefrom were
deemed to continue to exist until modified by the parties thereto in accordance
with the provisions of the Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> Thus,
for all intents and purposes, Republic Act No. 3844 is <u>the</u> governing
statute in the petition at bar.  The
pertinent provisions thereof state as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 5.  Establishment
of Agricultural Lease­hold Relations. - The agricultural leasehold relation
shall be established by operation of law in accordance with Section four of
this Code and, in other cases, either orally or in writing, expressly or
impliedly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 6.  Parties to

limited to the person who furnishes the landholding, either as owner, civil law
lessee, usufructuary, <u>or legal possessor, and the person who personally
cultivates the same</u>.  (emphasis
supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 7.  <u>Tenure of
Agricultural Leasehold Relation.  The
Agricultural Leasehold Relation once established shall confer upon the
agricultural lessee the right to continue working on the landholding until such
leasehold relationship is extinguished.  The agricultural lessee shall be entitled to security of tenure on his
landholding and cannot be ejected therefrom unless authorized by the Court for
causes herein provided</u>.  (emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 8.  Extinguishment of Agricultural Leasehold Relation.  The agricultural leasehold relation
established under this Code shall be extinguished by:</blockquote>

alienation or transfer of the legal possession of the landholding.  In case the agricultural lessor sells,
alienates or transfers the legal possession of the landholding, the purchaser
or transferee thereof shall be subrogated to the rights and substituted to the
obligations of the agricultural lessor."</blockquote>

lessee shall be entitled to disturbance compensation equivalent to five years
rental on his landholding in addition to his rights under Sections twenty-five
and thirty-four, except when the land owned and leased by the agricultural
lessor is not more than five hectares, in which case instead of disturbance
compensation the lessee may be entitled to an advanced notice of at least one
agricultural year before ejectment proceedings are filed against him:  <u>Provided</u>, further, That should the
landholder not cultivate the land himself for three years or fail to

That if the nonpayment of the rental shall be due to crop failure to the extent

non-payment shall not be a ground for dispossession, although the obligation to
pay the rental due that parti­cular crop year, is not thereby extinguished; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>(7)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the lessee employed a sub-lessee on his

<blockquote>"Sec. 37.  Burden of
Proof. - The burden of proof to show the existence of a lawful cause for the
ejectment of an agricultural lessee shall rest upon the agricultural
lessor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute, as it is admitted by the parties in this
case, that Benigno Bito-on was granted possession of the property in question
by reason of the liberality of his sister, Natividad (the private
respondent).  In short, he (Benigno) was
the LEGAL POSSESSOR of the property and, as such, he had the authority and
capacity to enter into an agricultural leasehold relation with Bernas.  Consequently, there is no need to dwell on
the contentions of the private respondent that her brother Benigno was not a
usufructuary of the property but actually a bailee in <u>commodatum</u>.  Whatever was the true nature of his
designation, he (Benigno) was the LEGAL POSSESSOR of the property and the law
expressly grants him, as legal possessor, authority and capacity to institute
an agricultural leasehold lessee on the property he legally possessed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In turn, having been instituted by Benigno as an agricultural
leasehold lessee, Bernas is vested by law with the rights accruing thereto,
including the right to continue working the landholding until such lease is
legally extinguished, and the right to be protected in his tenure i.e., not to
be ejected from the land, save for the causes provided by law, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>appropriately determined by the
courts.  In this connection, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>no clear indication in the record
that the circumstances or conditions envisioned in Section 36 of Republic Act
No. 3844, as amended, for termination of the agricultural lease relation, have
supervened, and therefore Bernas' right to the possession of the property
remains indisputable.  This conclusion is
buttressed by Sec. 37 of the Code which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 37.  Burden of
Proof. - The burden of proof to show the existence of a lawful cause for the
ejectment of an agricultural lessee shall rest upon the agricultural
lessor."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to any suggestion that the agricultural lease of Bernas may
have terminated because the landowner (Natividad) has decided to cultivate the
land herself, we submit that this Court is not in <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>position to settle this issue in this case, not only because
of insufficient evidence to determine whether or not the grounds provided by
law for termination of the agricultural leasehold relation are present but,
more importantly, because the issue of termination of the agri­cultural
leasehold relationship by reason of the landowner's alleged decision to till
the land herself, was not squarely raised nor adequately litigated in the trial
court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It will be noted that while Natividad in her complaint with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
alleged, among others, that "on 20 May 1985, the plaintiffs spouses were
already in the process of taking over the land by employing a tractor operator
to commence plowing the land," this allegation was denied by Bernas in his
answer.  But the main thrust of
Natividad's complaint was that she had no privity with Bernas and that the
latter should vacate the land because Benigno (from whom Bernas had received
his right to possess) had himself ceased to have any rights to the land.  Faced with these allegations, the court <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span><u>quo</u>
in its pre-trial order dated 9 September 1985 formulated the issues in this
case, without objection from the parties, as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top:.1in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
.1in;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"ISSUES<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is defendant an agricultural leasehold lessee
of the parcels of land described in the Complaint?</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the parties are entitled to damages
claims by them in their respective pleadings."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, the parties went to trial on the merits on the basis of
the foregoing issues.  Private
respondent did not object to the above issues as formulated; neither can it be
plausibly contended now that the first issue (i.e. whether Bernas is an
agricultural leasehold lessee) embraces the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">issue </span>of whether Natividad has validly terminated the
agricultural leasehold because of a decision to cultivate the land herself,
since under sec. 36(1) of the Code (before its amendment by Section 7 of Rep.
Act No. 6389), the land?owner's right to take over possession of his land
for personal cultivation <u>ASSUMES</u> that it is under a valid and subsisting
agricultural leasehold and he must obtain an order from the court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>disposses the agricultural leasehold
lessee who otherwise is entitled to continued use and possession of the
landholding.  In other words, if
Natividad had really intended to raise as an issue that she had validly
terminated Bernas' agricultural leasehold, she or her counsel could have
expressly included among the issues for determination, the question of whether
or not she had complied with the requirements of the law for dispossessing the
agricultural leasehold lessee because she, as landowner, had decided to
personally cultivate the landholding.  But she did not.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in its decision dated 20 October 1987 (later
appealed to the Court of Appeals) held (consistent with the formulated issues
in the case) that -<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bernas, as an agricultural leasehold lessee, subsequently arise, then and only
then can the private respondent (land owner) initiate a <u>separate</u> <u>action</u>
to dispossess the lessee, and in that separate action, she must allege and
prove compliance with Sec. 36(1) of the Code which consist of, among others, a
one year advance notice to the agricultural leasehold lessee (the land involved
being less than 5 hectares) and readiness to pay him the damages required also
by the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of whether <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>not
Bernas planted crops or used the land in a manner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">contrary </span>to what was agreed upon between Natividad and Benigno,
and thereby constituting a ground for terminating the leasehold relationship
under Sec. 36, par. 3 of Rep. Act No. 3844 likewise cannot be passed upon by
this Court since the issue was never raised before the courts below.  Furthermore, there is no showing that
Natividad and Benigno agreed that only certain types of crops could be planted
on the land.  What is clear is, that the
"dugo" arrangement was made so that Benigno could use the produce of
the land to provide for the schooling of his children.  The alleged conversion by Bernas of the land
to riceland was made necessary for the land to produce more and thus meet the
needs of Benigno.  It was consistent
with the purpose of making the land more productive that Benigno installed an
agricultural lessee.  It may be recalled
that when Natividad called on Benigno to testify as a witness, he stated that
the produce of the land was given to him by Bernas to defray the expenses of
his children (p. 3, trial court decision).  The inevitable conclusion is therefore <u>not</u> that there was use of
the land different from the purpose for which it was allegedly intended by
Natividad and Benigno but rather that the installation of the agricultural
lessee was made necessary so that the land could produce more to better serve
the needs of the beneficiary (Benigno).</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, it can be stated that the agricultural leasehold
relationship in this case was created between Benigno as agricultural
lessor-legal possessor, on the one hand, and Bernas as agricultural leasehold
lessee, on the other.  The agricultural
leashold relationship was <u>not</u> between Natividad and Bernas.  As Sec. 6 of the Code states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 6.  Parties to
Agricultural Leasehold Relations - The agricultural leasehold relations shall
be <u>limited</u> to the person who furnishes the landholding, either as owner,
civil law lessee, usufructuary, or <u>legal possessor, and the person who
personally cultivates the same</u>." (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There was, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as admitted </span>by all, no privity or tie between Natividad and
Bernas.  Therefore, even if Bernas had
improperly used the lots as ricelands, it was Benigno who could have objected
thereto since it was his (the legal possessor's) landholding that was being
"improperly" used.  But he
(Benigno) did not.  It is not for
Natividad (as landowner) to now complain that Bernas used the land "for a
purpose other than what had been previously agreed upon." Bernas had no
agreement with <u>her</u> as to the purpose for which the land was to be
used.  That they were converted into
ricelands (also for agricultural production) can only mean that the same (conversion)
was approved by Benigno (the undisputed agricultural lessor-legal
possessor).  It is thus clear that sec.
36, par 3 of the Code cannot be used to eject Bernas.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court must, in our view, keep in mind the policy of the State
embodied in the fundamental law and in several special statutes, of promoting
economic and social stability in the countryside by vesting the <u>actual</u> <u>tillers</u>
<u>and</u> <u>cultivators</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the
soil, with rights to the continued use and enjoyment of their landholdings
until they are validly dispossessed in accordance with law.  At this stage in the country's land reform
program, the agricultural lessee's right to security of tenure must be
"firmed-up" and not negated by inferences from facts not clearly
established in the record nor litigated in the courts below.  Hand in hand with diffusion of <u>ownership</u>
over agricultural lands, it is sound public policy to encourage and endorse a
diffusion of agricultural land <u>use</u> in favor of the <u>actual</u> <u>tillers</u>
<u>and</u> <u>cultivators</u> of the soil.  It is one effective way in the development of a strong and independent
middle-class in society.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In confirmation we believe of the foregoing views, Section 36 of
Rep. Act No. 3844 (the Code) was expressly amended by Section 7 of Rep. Act.
No. 6389 which replaced paragraph 1, Section 36 of the Code providing for
personal cultivation by the landowner as a ground for ejectment or
dispossession of the agricultural leasehold lessee with the following
provision:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 7.  Section 36 (1) of
the same Code is hereby amended to read as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The landholding is declared by the department
head upon recommendation of the National Planning Commission to be suited for
residential, commercial, industrial or some other urban purposes:  Provided, That the agricultural lessee shall
be entitled to disturbance compensation equivalent to five times the average of
the gross harvest of his landholding during the last five preceding calendar
years;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">While </span>it is true
that in the case of <u>Ancheta vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 200 SCRA 407, the
Court stated that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is well settled that RA 6389, which removed personal
cultivation <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>a ground for
ejectment of tenant/lessee, cannot be given retroactive effect in the absence
of statutory provision for retroactivity or a clear implication of the law to
that effect."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">however, Rep. Act No. 6389 was approved <u>on
</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">10 </span>September 1971</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

The complaint in this case was filed <u>on 21 June 1985</u> or long after the
approval of Rep. Act No. 6389.  By
reason of the provision therein <u>eliminating</u> personal cultivation by the
landowner as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>ground for
ejectment or dispossession of the agricultural leasehold lessee, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">any issue </span>of whether or not the Court
of Appeals decision should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nonetheless
be affirmed because the landowner had shown her intention or decided to
personally cultivate the land (assuming without admitting that the issue was
properly raised before the trial court), had in fact become moot and academic
(even before it was hypothetically raised).  The issue had been resolved by legislation </span>unmistakably against
the landowner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may of course be argued that "she (Natividad) <u>did not
authorize</u> her brother (Benigno) to install a tenant thereon." (TSN, 13
February 1986, p. 6).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if there was a <u>lack of authorization</u> (from Natividad)
for Benigno to install a tenant, it still follows, in our view, that Benigno as
legal possessor of the landholding, could install an agricultural lessee on the
landholding.  For, as defined in Section
166 (3) of the Code, an agricultural lessor is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>na<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">t</span>ural or juridical person <u>who, either as owner, civil law
lessee, usufructuary or legal possessor</u> lets or grants to another the
cultivation and use of his land for a price certain.  Nothing in said section, it will be noted, requires that the
civil law lessee, usufructuary or legal possessor should have the prior
authorization of the landowner in order to let or grant to another the
cultivation or use of the landholding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another question comes up:  did Natividad expressly prohibit Benigno from installing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>tenant on
the land?  Nothing in the evidence shows
that Benigno was expressly prohibited by Natividad from installing a tenant on
the landholding.  And even if there was
an express prohibition on the part of Natividad (landowner) for Benigno not to
install an agricultural leasehold lessee, it is to be noted that any such
arrangement (prohibition) was solely between Natividad and Benigno.  There is no evidence to show that Bernas was
aware or informed of any such arrangement between Natividad and Benigno.  Neither was such arrangement (prohibition),
if any, recorded in the registry of deeds to serve as notice to third persons
(as Bernas) and to the whole world for that matter.  Consequently, if there was indeed such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>prohibition (which is not borne out
by the records) imposed by Natividad on Benigno, a violation thereof may give
rise to a cause of action for Natividad against Benigno but Bernas is no less
an agricultural leasehold lessee, for the law (Section 166 (2) of the Code)
defines an agricultural lessee as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>person who by himself and with the help
available from within his immediate farm household cultivates the land
belonging to or possessed by another (in this case Benigno) with the latter's
consent for purposes of production for a price certain in money or in produce
or both.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Ponce vs. Guevarra</u>, L-19629 and L-19672-92, 31 March 1954
(10 SCRA 649) provides dramatic support to the <u>security of tenure</u> of
Bernas in the case at bar.  In the Ponce
case, the owner (Ponce) had leased his agricultural land to Donato (the lessee)
for a stipulated period with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>provision in the lease contract <u>prohibiting</u> Donato from
sub-leasing the land without the written consent of the owner (Ponce).  Notwith­standing this "<u>express</u> <u>prohibition</u>",
Donato sub-leased the land without the consent of Ponce (the owner).  When the lease contract expired, Donato
returned the land to Ponce but the sub-lessees (tenants) refused to vacate,
claiming security of tenure under the tenancy laws then enforced.  One of the contentions of Ponce (the owner)
in seeking to disposses the sub-lessees (tenants) was that these tenants
entered into possession of the land under a violation of the lease contract by
Donato (the lessee).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Over-ruling the above contention, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is true that the subleasing of said land to respondents
herein (tenants) without the written consent of the petitioner (owner),
constituted a violation of the original contract of lease.  The breach of contract was committed,
however, by Donato (the lessee), x.x.x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Of course, in the same Ponce case, the
Court observed that Ponce renewed his lease contract for another year with
Donato, knowing at the time of such renewal that the land had been sub-leased
to the tenants, thereby injecting the principle of estoppel against Ponce
vis-a-vis the tenants.  But, as we view
it, the <u>ratio decidendi</u> in the Court's decision is to the effect that
the sub-lessees (tenants) were entitled to security of tenure on the land they
were cultivating, notwithstanding the undisputed fact that they became
sub-lessees (tenants) of the land as a result of a violation by the lessee
(Donato) of an express provision in the lease contract prohibiting him from
sub-leasing the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">What more in the case of Bernas whose right to security of tenure
as an agricultural leasehold lessee is conferred and protected categorically,
positively and clearly by the provisions of the Code (Republic Act. 3844)?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of course possible to contrue Sec. 6 of the Code which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 6.  Parties to
Agricultural Leasehold Relations. - The agricultural leasehold relation shall
be limited to the person who furnishes the landholding, either as owner, civil
law lessee, usufructuary, <u>or legal possessor, and the person who personally
cultivates the same</u>.  (emphasis supplied)."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x it assumes that there is already an existing
agricultural leasehold relation, i.e. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>tenant or agricultural lessee already
works the land.  As may be gleaned from
the epigraph of Sec. 6, it merely states who are "Parties to Agricultural
Leasehold Relations," which means that there is already a leasehold tenant
on the land.  But this is precisely what
We are still asked to determine in these proceedings." (dissenting opinion,
p. 11)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It would appear from the above interpretation of Sec. 6 of the
Code that in the absence of a judicial determination or declaration of an
agricultural leasehold relation, such relation does not or cannot even
exist.  We view this posture as
incorrect <u>for an agricultural leasehold relationship exists by operation of
law</u> when there is a concurrence of an agricultural lessor and an
agricultural lessee.  As clearly stated
in Section 5 of the Code:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>5.  Establishment of Agricultural Leasehold
Relations. - The agricultural leasehold relation shall be established by
operation of law in accordance with Section four of this Code and, in other
cases, either orally or in writing, expressly or impliedly."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In other words, in the case at bar, from
the moment Benigno, as legal possessor (and, therefore, an agicultural lessor)
granted the cultivation and use of the landholding to Bernas in exchange or
consideration for a sharing in the harvest, an agricultural leasehold
relationship emerged between them "by operation of law".</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the transfer from Natividad to Benigno was
gratuitous, we believe, is of no consequence as far as the nature and status of
Benigno's possession of the landholding is concerned.  <u>He became the legal possessor thereof from the viewpoint of
the Code</u>.  And as legal possessor,
he had the right and authority, also under the Code, to install or institute an
agricultural leasehold lessee on his landholding, which was exactly what he
did, i.e. install Bernas as an agricultural leasehold lessee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument that Benigno's (and consequently, Bernas')
possession was meant to last for a limited period only, may appeal to logic,
but it finds no support in the Code which has its own underlying public policy
to promote.  For Section 7 of the Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 7.  <u>Tenure of
Agricultural Leasehold Relation.  The
Agricultural Leasehold Relation once established shall confer upon the
agricultural lessee the right to continue working on the landholding until such
leasehold relationship is extinguished.  The agricultural lessee shall be entitled to security of tenure on his
landholding and cannot be ejected therefrom unless authorized by the Court for
causes herein provided</u>.  (emphasis
supplied)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">while Section 10 of the Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 10.  Agricultural
Leasehold Relation Not Extinguished by Expiration of Period, etc. - The
agricultural leasehold relation under this Code <u>shall not be extinguished</u>
by mere expiration of the term or period in a leasehold contract nor by the
sale, alienation <u>or transfer of the legal possession of the landholding</u>.  In case the agricultural lessor sells,
alienates <u>or transfers the legal possession of the landholding</u>, the
purchaser or <u>transferee thereof shall be subrogated to the rights and
substituted to the obligations of the agricultural lessor</u>." (emphasis
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">and Section 36 of the Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Possession of Landholding; Exceptions. - <u>Notwithstanding
any agreement <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>to the period
or future surrender of the land</u>, an agricultural lessee shall continue in
the enjoyment and possession of his landholding x x x." (emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the return of legal possession from Benigno to Natividad
cannot prejudice the rights of Bernas as an agricultural leasehold lessee.  The grounds for ejectment of an agricultural
leasehold lessee are provided for by law.  The enumeration is <u>exclusive</u> and no other grounds can justify
termination of the lease.  The policy
and letter of the law are clear on this point.</p>

<p class="BODY">The relatively small area of the agricultural landholding
involved (a little over half a hectare) would appear, in our view, to be of no
consequence in this case.  Here, the
issue is not how much area <u>may be retained in ownership by the land owner</u>
Natividad but the issue is whether Bernas is a duly constituted agricultural
leasehold lessee of the agricultural landholding (<u>regardless of its area</u>)
and entitled to security of tenure therein.  And, as abundantly shown, the Code is definitely and clearly on his side
of this issue.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be pointed out that the report and recommendation of
the investigating officer of the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) finding that
Bernas is not an agricultural leasehold lessee should deserve little
consideration.  It should be stressed,
in this connection, that said report and recommendation is <u>congenitally</u> <u>defective</u>
because -</p>

<p class="NUM">a.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>It was based <u>solely</u>
on the evidence presented by Natividad, Bernas did not participate in said
investigation.</p>

<p class="NUM">b.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the findings in the
report are not supported by law or jurisprudence but are merely the opinion and
conclusions of the investigator whose knowledge of the Code and the case law
appears to be sadly inadequate.</p>

<p class="NUM">c.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>whether or not an
agricultural leasehold relation exists in any case is basically a question of
law and cannot be left to the determination or opinion of a MAR?investigator
on the basis of one-sided evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has ruled in <u>Qua v. Court of Appeals</u>, 198 SCRA
236 that --<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x as regards relations between litigants in land cases,
the findings and conclusions of the Secretary of Agrarian Reform, being
preliminary in nature, are not in any way binding on the trial courts which
must endeavor to arrive at their own independent conclusions."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The ruling finds support in the case of <u>Graza v. CA</u> (163
SCRA 39) citing Section 12 of PD No. 946 expressly stating that "The
preliminary determination of the relationship between the contending parties by
the Secretary of Agrarian Reform or his authorized representative, is not
binding upon the court, judge or hearing officer to whom the case is certified
as a proper case for trial.  Said court,
judge or hearing officer, after hearing, may confirm, reverse or modify said
preliminary determination as the evidence and substantial merits of the case
may warrant." The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in the case at bar tried the
case on the merits, receiving the evidence of <u>both</u> <u>parties</u> and
arrived at a conclusion different from that of the MAR investigator.  It is to be noted that even the Court of
Appeals (which decided for Natividad) found no use for the MAR investigator's
report and recommendation, for obvious reasons.  It is clear that the question of the existence of an agricultural
leasehold relationship is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span><u>question</u> <u>of</u> <u>law</u> which is properly within
the province of the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The certification of the President of the Agrarian Reform
Beneficiaries Association, Panay chapter "issued upon the request of Mrs.
Deita" (meaning Natividad) that Bernas is not in the masterlist of
tenants, should likewise be disregarded.  Since when, it may be noted, was the legal question of agricultural
leasehold relationship made to depend on a certification of such an
association's president?</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument that Bernas is not a lawful tenant of Natividad
based on the doctrine in the case of <u>Lastimoza v. Blanco</u> (1 SCRA 231) is
also not correct.  The cited case does
not support the desired conclusion.  In
the Lastimoza case, a certain Nestor Panada had an oral contract of tenancy
with a certain Perfecto Gallego who was then in possession of the parcel of
land.  The latter however was ejected
after the Court of First Instance ruled in a land registration proceeding that
it was Lastimoza who was the true owner of the land.  The Court in effect ruled that Gallego was an <u>unlawful</u> <u>possessor</u>
and thus Panada <u>cannot</u> be a lawful tenant.  The factual background of the Lastimoza case and the present
Bernas case are totally different; the first case cannot be applied to the
second.  When Bernas was instituted by
Benigno as an agricultural lessee, Benigno was a legal possessor of the
landholding in question.  No one can
dispute this.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The dissenting opinion states that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">"x x </span>it is not correct to say that every legal possessor,
be he a usufructuary, or a bailee, is authorized as a matter of right to employ
a tenant.  His possession can be limited
by agreement of the parties or by operation of law." (p. 13) Even assuming
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">arguendo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>that this is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>correct legal statement, there is
absolutely no showing that the possession of Benigno was limited by his
agreement with Natividad (as to prohibit him from instituting a tenant) or by
operation of law; and because there is a total failure to disprove and even
dispute that Benigno was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>legal
possessor at the time Bernas was installed by him as an agricultural lessee,
then Bernas validly became an agricultural leasehold lessee of the land and is
thus protected by the law from ejectment except for causes specified therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in relation to the dissenting opinion, it may be wise to
repeat the statement of the Court in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Jose

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BELLOSILLO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This may be a faint echo
in the wilderness but it is the quaint voice of a woman yearning for justice
from this </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">court of last
resort</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The
majority opinion would leave her alone where she is, to wallow in her own
misery, and despite her </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">long </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and winding travails - all for the love of a
brother in need - there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  There is no relief in sight for her
plight.  Her only fault was to lend her
four (4) small parcels of land to her brother so that the latter could use the
fruits thereof for the education of his children in Manila.  Now, she cannot get them back because her
brother allowed his brother-in-law, who now claims security of tenure as
tenant, to work the lands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Worse, the brother-in-law
continues to cultivate the landholdings, even converting the orchards into
ricelands as though they were his own and constructing a house of strong
materials thereon, without paying any rent!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Before seeking judicial
relief, private respondent went to the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) as
required by law,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and obtained a favorable finding that there
was no tenancy relationship between her and her brother's brother?in-law.  But the courts below disregarded this

<p class="BODY">My conscience prompts me to dissent from the majority opinion and
to vote for the affirmance of the decision of the Court of Appeals, not
necessarily on the basis of its rationale, but mainly because I do not
subscribe to the view that a usufructuary or legal possessor under Sec. 6, R.A.
3844, as amended, is automatically authorized to employ a tenant without the
consent of the landowner.  For, the
right to hire a tenant is basically a personal right of a landowner, except as
may be provided by law.  But, certainly,
nowhere in Sec. 6 of R.A. 3844 does it say that a legal possessor of a
landholding is automatically authorized to install a tenant thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Natividad Bito-on Deita owns Lots 794, 801, 840 and 848 of the
Cadastral Survey of Panay, Capiz.  Lots
794 and 801, with areas of 943 square meters (Exh. "C") and 855
square meters (Exh. "B"), respectively, are coconut lands; Lot 840,
with an area of 1,000 square meters (Exh. "D"), is planted to
bananas, while Lot 848, with an area of 1,146 square meters (Exh.
"A"), is riceland.  Lot 840
was the owner’s homelot on which stood before the family home.  Although the trial court found that the
total area of the four (4) lots, which are not contiguous, was 5,831 square
meters, a closer examination of their tax declarations (Exhs. "A" to
"D") reveals that their total productive area is only 3,844 square
meters, which can be smaller than a residential lot in a plush village in Metro
Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Natividad recovered these lots from a former tenant in
April 1978, she entrusted them to her brother, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Natividad was unaware of this arrangement as she was staying in Manila where

not until the latter's retirement and the return of the family to Panay, Capiz,
that she learned that Graciano was already working the lands, converting Lots
794, 801 and 840 into ricelands, and constructing on Lot 840 a house of
concrete hollow blocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

'DUGO' grantee or trustee returns the subject matter of 'DUGO', the
relationship is terminated x x x x  In

<p class="BODY">On 13 May 1985, his children having finished schooling in Manila,
Benigno returned possession of the property to Natividad, in faithful
compliance with their agreement.  However, Graciano refused to vacate the premises claiming at first that
he was installed thereon by Benigno, although after Benigno denied this
allegation, petitioner changed his theory by presenting Monica.  Bernales Bito-on, wife of Benigno, to

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Those who hold that
Graciano is a leasehold tenant anchor their proposition on the above provision
of Sec. 6 as they find Benigno a "legal possessor" of the lands and
so could legally install a tenant thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I strongly disagree.  When
Sec. 6 provides that the agricultural leasehold relations shall be limited to
the person who furnishes the landholding, either as owner, civil law lessee,
usufructuary, or legal possessor, and the person who personally cultivates the
same, it assumes that there <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>an
existing agricultural leasehold relation, i.e., a tenant or agricultural lessee
already works the land.  As may be
gleaned from the epigraph of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Sec. </span>6,
it merely states who are <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">"</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Parties to Agricultural Leasehold Relations</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">," </span>which means that there is
already a leasehold tenant on the land.  But this is precisely what we are still asked to determine in these
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">To better understand Sec. 6, R.A. 3844, let us refer to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">its </span>precursor, Sec. 8, R.A. 1199, as
amended, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 8.  <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Limitation</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

tenant shall be limited to the person who furnishes land, either as owner,
lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor, and to the person who actually works
the land himself with the aid of labor available from within his immediate farm
household."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Again, Sec. 8 of R.A.
1199 assumes the existence of a tenancy relation.  But, as its epigraph states, it is a "Limitation of
Relation," and the purpose is merely to limit the tenancy "to the
person who furnishes land, either as owner, lessee, usufructuary, or legal
possessor, and to the person who actually works the land himself with the aid
of labor available from within his immediate farm household." </span>Otherwise
stated, once the tenancy relation is established, the parties to that relation
are limited to the persons therein stated.  But, obviously, inherent in their right to install a tenant <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>their authority to do so;
otherwise, without such authority, they cannot install a tenant on the
landholding.  But, definitely, neither
Sec. 6 of R.A. 3844 nor Sec. 8 of R.A. 1199 automatically authorizes the
persons named therein to employ a tenant on the landholding.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">According to Santos and
Macalino, considered authorities on land reform, the reason for Sec. 6, R.A.
3844, and Sec. 8, R.A. 1199, in limiting the relationship to the lessee and the
lessor is "to discourage absenteeism on the part of the lessor and the
custom of co-tenancy" under, which "the tenant </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(lessee) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"Since the law establishes a special relationship in tenancy
with important consequences, it properly pinpoints the persons to whom said relationship

to prevent both landholder absenteeism and tenant absenteeism.  Thus, it would seem that the discretionary
powers and important duties of the landholder, like the choice of crop or seed,
cannot be left to the will or capacity of an agent or overseer, just as the

that every legal possessor, be he a usufructuary or a bailee, is authorized as
a matter of right to employ a tenant.  His possession can be limited by agreement of the parties or by
operation of law.  In the case before

<p class="BODY">As already stated, Sec. 6 simply enumerates who are the parties
to an existing contract of agricultural tenancy, which presupposes that a
tenancy already exists.  It does not
state that those who furnish the landholding, i.e., either as owner, civil, law
lessee, usufructuary, or legal possessor, are automatically authorized to
employ a tenant on the landholding.   The
reason is obvious.  The legal possession
may be restrictive.  Even the owner
himself may not be free to install a tenant, as when his ownership or
possession <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is
</span>encumbered or is subject to a lien or condition that he should not
employ a tenant thereon.  This
contemplates a situation where the property may be intended for some other
specific purpose allowable by law, such as, its conversion into a subdivision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the transfer of possession was purely
gratuitous.  It was not made for any
consideration except for the "dugo" or blood relationship between
Natividad and Benigno.  Consequently,
the generation of rights arising therefrom should be strictly construed in
favor of Natividad.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In fact, </span>for lack of consideration,
she may take back the land at any time unless she allows a reasonable time for
Benigno to harvest the produce of what he may have planted thereon as a
possessor in good faith.  There is not
even any valid obligation on her part to keep Benigno in possession, except as
herein adverted to, much less should she be deprived of such possession just
because another person <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

Natividad for the reason that Benigno, after failing to return the landholding
to Natividad, already became a deforciant, and a deforciant cannot install a
lawful tenant who </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">entitled to security
of tenure.  Incidentally, Benigno and
Graciano being brothers-in-law, their wives being sisters, and living in a
small barangay, Graciano cannot profess ignorance of the very nature of the
possession of Benigno as well as the restrictions to his possession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It may be relevant to
consider, for a better appreciation of the facts, the actual condition of the
landholdings.  As already adverted to,
Lots 794 and 801 are coconut lands with an area of 943 square meters (Exh.
"C") and 855 square meters (Exh. "B"), respectively, or a
total area of 1,798 square meters.  With
this meager area for the two (2) coconut lands, there is indeed </span>no
reason <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to have them tenanted.  The coconut lands need not be cultivated
when the coconut trees are already fruit-bearing.  Benigno only had to ensure that the fruits thereof were not stolen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lot 840 has an area of
1,000 square meters (Exh. "D") and is planted to bananas.  Like the coconut lands, </span>no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">tenant is needed to cultivate it and Benigno
only has to keep watch over it against stray animals and protect his
harvests.  If we take away from this
area of 1,000 square meters the homelot reserved for the owner, the remaining </span>portion
for production cannot be more than 800 square meters.  It can be less, depending on the size of the homelot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before Graciano converted Lots 714, 801 and 840 into ricelands,
the only riceland then was Lot 848, with an area of 1,146 square meters (Exh.
"A").  This is too small for
an economic family-size farm to sustain Benigno and his family even if he works
it himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the size of the landholdings, which have a total
productive area of only 3,844 square meters per their tax declarations, there
may not be enough produce to pay for the educational expenses of his children
if Benigno did not work the land himself.  Hiring a tenant would defeat the purpose for which the possession was
given to him.  In other words, it would
be absurd for Benigno to hire another person to cultivate the land and share
the produce thereof.  As a matter of
fact, to minimize expenses, the children of Benigno and Monica stayed with
Natividad while schooling in Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since Lots 714, 801 and 840 are planted to coconut and banana
trees, they are classified as lands planted to permanent crops.  Consequently, in order for a person to be
considered a tenant of these lands, he must have planted the crops himself
before they became fruit-bearing.  But,
in the case before us, the coconut and banana trees were already fruit-bearing
at the time Graciano commenced to work on the lands, hence, he cannot be
considered a tenant of these lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the transfer of possession of the landholding from
Natividad to Benigno should be strictly viewed as one for the cultivation alone
of Benigno, himself a farm worker, who was not authorized by Natividad to
employ a tenant.  Benigno's possession
was limited only to the enjoyment of the fruits thereof, subject to the will of
landowner Natividad.  Benigno was not
empowered to install a tenant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Benigno therefore possessed the land as a mere
possessor-cultivator.  As such, he was
required <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>personally till or
cultivate the land and use the produce thereof to defray the cost of education
of his children.  Natividad, who
entrusted her landholdings to Benigno, was still the agricultural
owner-cultivator, who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>"any
person who, providing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">capital and
management, personally cultivates his own land with the aid of his immediate

Benigno was also the cultivation of Natividad.  Indeed, the fact that the lands were free of tenants when Natividad
entrusted them </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Benigno was
indicative of her intention to maintain that condition of the landholdings and
have them tended personally by Benigno himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Accordingly, neither
Benigno nor Graciano can be a lessee-tenant who enjoys security of tenure.  Benigno could only be an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">encargado</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

than the wife of Benigno, Monica Bernales-Bito-on, who testified that she was
the civil law lessee who installed Graciano as tenant.  Interestingly, Monica is the sister of Adela
Bernales, wife of Graciano.  But why
should Monica be the civil law lessee </span>and not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Natividad constituting her brother Benigno as the possessor of the lands, it
was Monica who was entrusted with them.  That is contrary to common practice and experience.  Even the trial court itself found the
version of Graciano incredible when it held that Benigno was the legal
possessor in the concept of usufructuary.  Yet, it ignored this discrepancy - which could have destroyed the
credibility of Graciano - when in fact it could have totally negated or
disregarded Graciano's assertion of tenancy derived from Monica as civil law
lessee.  The conclusion is not

<p class="BODY">Some may have apprehensions that should Sec. 6 of R.A. 3844 be
construed as not to vest the legal possessor with automatic authority to
install tenants, it would in effect open the floodgates to their ejectment on
the mere pretext that the legal possessor was not so authorized by the
landowner.  This is more imagined than
real.  The landowner has the burden of
proving that the legal possessor was not authorized to install tenants and,
more often than not, the legal possessor is so empowered.  In civil law lease, for instance, where
there is consideration, the general rule is that the lessee can sublease the
leased holding <u>unless there is an express prohibition against subletting in
the contract itself</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in order for the lessee to be barred from subletting, the contract of
lease must expressly stipulate to that effect.  In this case, the transaction between brother and sister was not for any
material consideration nor was it intended to defeat any purpose of law.  There is not even any insinuation that
Benigno was only being used by Natividad to oust Graciano from the lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, should the majority still hold that Sec. 6 of R.A.
3844 authorizes the persons therein enumerated to institute <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a tenant </span>automatically, although I
strongly disagree, it should at most be made to apply only to transfers of
legal possession where there is material consideration, and not where such
transfers are absolutely gratuitous or purely out of benevolence because of
personal or blood relationship.  Unfortunately for Natividad, her benevolence does not seem to evoke
reciprocal benevolence from this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, I have to dissent from the
majority opinion and reiterate my vote to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">AFFIRM</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>the judgment under review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, I can only hope that, in the end, the real meaning of
justice in this case is attained.</p>
