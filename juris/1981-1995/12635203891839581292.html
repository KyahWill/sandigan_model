				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Before the Court en banc
is a motion to re­consider the decision promulgated on July 20, 1982 which set
aside the decision of respondent National Labor Relations Commission and
reinstated the decision of the National Seamen Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">To better understand the
issues raised in the motion for reconsideration, we reiterate the background
facts of the case, taken from the decision of the National Labor Relations
Commission:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It appears that on different dates in December, 1978 and
January, 1979, the Seamen entered into separate con­tracts of employment with
the Company, engaging than to work on board M/T 'Jannu' for a period of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">twelve </span>(12)
months.  After verification and approval
of their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">contracts
by the NSB, the Seamen boarded their vessel in Japan.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"On
</span>10 January 1979, the master of the vessel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">complainant </span>Rogelio H. Bisula, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">received a cable
from the Company advising him of the possibility that the vessel might be
directed </span>to call at ITF-controlled ports and at the same time informing
him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of the </span>procedure
to be followed in the computation of the special or additional compensation of
crew members while in said ports.  ('ITF' is the acronym for the International Transport Workers
Federation, a militant international labor organiza­tion with affiliates in
different ports of the world, which reputedly can tie down a vessel in a port
by preventing its loading or unloading.  This is a sanction resorted to by ITF to enforce the payment of its
wages rates for seafarers, the so-called ITF rates, if the wages of the crew
members of a vessel who have affiliated with it are below its prescribed
rates.) In the same cable of the Company, it expressed its regrets for not
clarifying earlier the procedure in computing the special compensation as it
thought that the vessel would 'trade in Caribbean ports only.'</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"On 22 March 1979, the
Company sent another cable to complainant Bisula, this </span>time informing
him of the respective amounts each of the officers and crew members would
receive as special compensation when the vessel called at the port of Kwinana,
Australia, an ITF-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">controlled port.  This was followed by another cable on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">23 March 1979, informing </span>him that the
officers and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">crew members had </span>been
enrolled as members of the ITF in Sidney, Australia, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>the membership fee for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">28 </span>personnel complement of the vessel
had already been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">paid.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In answer to the Company's cable last mentioned, complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Bisula, in </span>representation of the other
officers and crew members, sent on 24 March 1979 a cable <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in­</span>forming the Company that the
officers and crew members were not agreeable to its 'suggestion'; that they
were not contented with their present salaries 'based on the volume of works,
type of ship with hazardous cargo and registered in a worldwide trade; that the
'officers and crew (were) not interested in ITF membership if not actually paid
with ITF rate'; that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">their </span>'demand
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is only </span>50% increase based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">on present </span>basic salary'; and that the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">proposed wage increase is </span>the
'best and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">only solution to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">solve I</span>TF <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">problem' since </span>the Company's salary <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">rates 'especially in tankers (are) very </span>far in comparison <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">with other shipping agencies in Manila x x
x.'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In reply, the Company proposed a 25% increase in the basic
pay of the complainant crew members, although it claimed that it would 'suffer
and absorb consi­derable amount of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">losses.'
</span>The proposal was accepted by the Seamen with certain conditions which
were accepted by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Company.  </span>Conformably with the agreement of the
parties which was effected through the cables abovementioned, the Seamen were
paid their new salary rates.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Subsequently, the Company sought authority from the NSB to
cancel the contracts of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">employment </span>of
the Seamen, claiming that its principals had ter­minated their manning
agreement because of the actuations of the Seamen.  The request was granted by the NSB Executive Director in a letter
dated 10 April 1979.  Soon thereafter,
the Company cabled the Seamen informing them that their contracts would be
terminated upon the vessel's arrival in Japan.  On 19 April 1979 they were asked to disembark from the vessel, their
contracts were terminated, and they were repatriated to Manila.  There is no showing that the Seamen were
given the opportunity to at least comment on the Company's request for the
cancellation of their contracts, although they had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">served only three (3) out of the twelve (12) months' duration of their
contracts."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The private respondents
filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and non-payment of earned wages with
the National Seamen Board.  The Vir-jen
Ship­ping and Marine Services Inc. in turn filed a complaint for breach of
contract and recovery of excess salaries and overtime pay against the private
respondents.  On July 2, 1980, the NSB
rendered a decision declaring that the seamen breached their employment
contracts when they demanded and received from Vir-jen Shipping </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">wages </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">over and above their contracted rates.  The dismissal of the seamen was declared legal and the seamen were
ordered suspended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The seamen appealed the
decision to the NLRC which reversed the decision of the NSB and required the
petitioner to pay the wages and other monetary benefits corresponding to the
unexpired portion of the manning contract on the ground that the termination of
the contract by the petitioner was without valid cause.  Vir-jen Shipping </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">filed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">the present petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The private respondents
submit the following issues in their motion for reconsideration:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“A. THIS HONORABLE
COURT DID VIOLENCE TO LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT HELD THAT THE FINDING OF <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">FACT </span>OF THE NATIONAL SEAMEN BOARD THAT
THE SEAMEN VIOLATED THEIR CONTRACTS IS MORE CREDIBLE THAN THE FINDING OF FACT
OF THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION THAT THE SEAMEN DID <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">NOT </span>VIOLATE THEIR CONTRACT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“B. THIS HONORABLE
COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT VIRJEN'S HAVING AGREED TO A <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">25% </span>INCREASE OF THE SEAMEN'S BASIC WAGE WAS NOT VOLUNTARY <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">BUT </span>WAS DUE TO THREATS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“C. THIS HONORABLE

THE ADDENDUM AGREEMENT COULD BE TAKEN COGNIZANCE OF, THIS <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">HONORABLE </span>COURT ERRED WHEN IT FOUND

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">At the outset, we are faced
with the question whether or not the Court en banc should give due course to
the motion for reconsideration inspite of its having been denied twice by the
Court's Second Division.  The case was
referred to and accepted by the Court en banc because of the movants'
contention that the decision in this case by the Second Division deviated from <u>Wallem
Phil. Shipping Inc. v. Minister of Labor</u> (L-50734-37, February 20, 1981), a
First Division case with the same facts and </span>issues.  We <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">are
constrained to answer the initial question in the affirmative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">A fundamental postulate
of Philippine Constitu­tional Law is the fact that there is only one Supreme
Court from whose decisions all other courts are required to take their
bearings.  (Albert v. Court of First
Instance, 23 SCRA 948; Barrera v. Barrera, 34 SCRA 98; Tugade v. Court of
Appeals, 85 SCRA 226).  The majority of
the Court's work is now performed by its two Divisions, but the Court remains
one court, single, unitary, com­plete, and supreme.  Flowing from this nature of the Supreme Court is the fact that,
while individual Justices may dissent or partially concur with one another,
when the Court states what the law is, it speaks with only one voice.  And that voice being authoritative should be
as clear as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Any doctrine or principle
of law laid down by the Court, whether en banc or in Division, may be modified
or reversed only by the Court en banc.  (Section 2(3), Article X, Constitution.) In the rare instances when one
Division disagrees in its views with the other Division, or the necessary votes
on an issue cannot be had in a Division, the case is brought to the Court en
banc to reconcile any seeming conflict, to reverse or modify an earlier
decision, and to declare the Court's doc­trine.  This is what has happened in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The decision sought to be
reconsidered appears to be a deviation from the Court's decision, speaking
through the First Division, in <u>Wallem Shipping, Inc. v. Hon. Minister of
Labor</u> (102 SCRA 835).  Faced with
two seemingly conflicting resolutions of basically the same issue by its two
Divisions, the Court, therefore, resolved to transfer the case to the Court en
banc.  Parenthetically, the petitioner's
comment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">the third motion for reconsideration states
that the resolution of the motion might be the needed vehicle to make the
ruling in the <u>Wallem</u> case clearer and more in line with the underlying
principles of the Labor Code.  We agree
with the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After an exhaustive, painstaking, and perspi­cacious
consideration of the motions for reconsideration and the comments, replies, and
other pleadings related thereto, the Court en banc is constrained to grant the
motions.  To grant the motion is to keep
faith <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">with </span>the constitutional
mandate to afford protection to labor and to assure the rights of workers, to
self-organization and to just and humane conditions of work.  We sustain the decision of the respondent
National Labor Relations Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are various arguments raised by the petitioners but the common
thread running through all of them is the contention, if not the dismal
prophecy, that if the respondent seamen are sus­tained by this Court, we would
in effect "kill the hen that lays the golden egg." In other words,
Filipino seamen, admittedly among the best in the world, should remain
satisfied with relatively lower if not the lowest, international rates of
compensa­tion, should not agitate for higher wages while their contracts of
employment are subsisting, should accept as sacred, iron clad, and immutable
the side con­tracts which require them to falsely pretend to be members <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">of </span>international labor federations,
pretend to receive higher salaries at certain foreign ports only to return the
increased pay once the ship leaves that port, should stifle not only their
right to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ask </span>for
improved terms of employment but their freedom of speech <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and </span>expression, and should suffer
instant termination of employment at the slightest sign of dissatisfaction with
no protection from their Government and their courts.  Otherwise, the peti­tioners contend that Filipinos would no
longer be accepted as seamen, those employed would lose their jobs, and the
still unemployed would be left hopeless.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the first time and it will not be the last where the
threat of unemployment and loss of jobs would be used to argue against the
interests of labor; where efforts by workingmen to better their terms of
employment would be characterized as pre­judicing the interests of labor as a
whole.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">In 1867 or one hundred
sixteen years ago, Chief Justice Beasley of the Supreme Court of New Jersey was
ponente of the court's opinion declaring as a conspiracy the threat of
workingmen to strike in connection with their efforts to promote unionism.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It is difficult to believe that a right exists in law which we can
scarcely conceive can produce, in any posture of affairs, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">other than injurious results</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">It is simply the right of workmen, by concert

of another.  I am unwilling to hold that
<u>a right which cannot, in any event, be advantageous to the em­ployee, and
which must always be hurtful  to the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The same arguments have
greeted every major advance in the rights of the workingman.  <u>And they have </u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:23.0pt">invariably been proved unfounded and false</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:23.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Unionism, employers'

16.0pt">which lays the golden eggs." The claims of workingmen were
described as outrageously injurious not only to the employer but more so to </span>the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">employees themselves before these
claims or demands were established by law and jurisprudence as
"rights" and before these were proved beneficial to the management,
labor, and the nation as a whole beyond reasonable </span>doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">case before us does
not represent any major advance in the rights of labor and the workingmen.  The private respondents merely sought rights
already established.  No matter how much
the petitioner-employer tries to present itself as speaking for the entire
industry, there is no evidence that it is typical of employers hiring Filipino
seamen or that it can speak for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The contention that
manning industries in the Philippines would not survive if the instant case is
not decided in favor of the petitioner is not supported by evidence.  The <u>Wallem</u> case was decided on
February 20, 1981.  There have been no
severe repercussions, no drying up of employment opportunities for seamen, and
none of the dire consequences repeatedly emphasized by the petitioner.  Why should <u>Vir-jen</u> be an exception?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The wages of seamen
engaged in international shipping are shouldered by the foreign principal.  The local manning office is an agent whose
primary </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">function </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is recruitment and who usually gets a lump
sum from the shipowner to defray the salaries of the crew.  The hiring of seamen and the determination
of their compensation is subject to the interplay of var­ious market factors
and one key factor is how much in terms of profits the local manning office and
the </span>foreign shipowner may realize after the costs of the voyage are
met.  And costs include salaries of
officers and crew members.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Filipino seamen are
admittedly as competent and reliable as seamen from any other country in the
world.  Otherwise, there would not be so
many </span>of them in the vessels sailing in every ocean and sea on this
globe.  It is competence and
reliability, not cheap labor that makes our seamen so greatly in demand.  Filipino seamen have never demanded the same
high salaries as seamen from the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and
other developed nations.  But certainly
they are entitled to government protec­tion when they ask for fair and decent
treatment by their employers and when they exercise the right to petition for
improved terms of employment, especially when they feel that these are
sub-standard or are capable of improvement according to inter­nationally
accepted rules.  In the domestic scene,
there are marginal employers who prepare two sets of payrolls for their
employees – one in keeping with minimum wages and the other recording the
sub-standard wages that the employees really receive.  The reliable employers, however, not only meet the minimums
required by fair labor standards legislation but even go way above the minimums
while earning reason­able profits and prospering.  The same is true of international employment.  There is no reason why this Court and the
Ministry of Labor and Employment or its agencies and commissions should come
out with pro­nouncements based on the standards and practices of unscrupulous
or inefficient shipowners, who claim they cannot survive without resorting to
tricky and deceptive schemes, instead of Government main­taining labor law and
jurisprudence according to the practices of honorable, competent, and
law-abiding employers, domestic or foreign.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">If any minor advantages
given to Filipino </span>seamen may somehow cut into the profits of local man­ning
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">agencies </span>and foreign shipowners,
that is not sufficient reason why the NSB or the NLRC should not stand by the
former instead of listening to unsubstantiated fears that they would be killing
the hen which lays the golden eggs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Prescinding from the
above, we now hold that neither the National Seamen Board nor the National
Labor Relations Commission should, as a matter of official policy, legitimize
and enforce dubious arrangements where shipowners and seamen enter into
fictitious contracts similar to the addendum agree­ments or side contracts in
this case whose purpose is to deceive.  The Republic of the Philippines and its </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">ministries and agencies should present a more honorable and proper
posture in official acts to the whole world, notwithstanding our desire to have
as many job openings both here and abroad for our workers.  At the very least, such a sensitive matter
involving no less than our dignity as a people and the welfare of our
workingmen must proceed from the Batasang Pambansa in the form of policy
legislation, not from administrative rule making or adjudication.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Another issue raised by
the movants is whether or not the seamen violated their contracts of
employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The form contracts
approved by the National Sea­men Board are designed to protect Filipino seamen
not foreign shipowners who can take care of themselves.  The standard forms embody the basic minimums
which must be incorporated as parts of the employment contract.  (Section 15, Rule V, Rules and Regulations
Implementing the Labor Code.) They are not collective bargaining agreements or
immutable contracts which the parties cannot improve upon or modify in the
course of the agreed period of time.  To
state, therefore, that the affected seamen cannot petition their employer for
higher salaries during the 12 months duration of the contract runs counter to
established principles of labor legislation.  The National Labor Relations Commission, as the appellate tribunal from
decisions he of the National Seamen Board, correctly ruled that the seamen </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">did </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">not violate their contracts to warrant their dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The respondent Commission
ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the light of all the fore­going facts, we find that the cable

threat to compel the Company to accede to their proposals.  But even assuming, if only for the sake of

threat that they would report to ITF if <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The facts show that when
the respondents boarded the M/T Jannu, there was no intention to send their
ship to Australia.  On January 10, 1979,
the peti­tioner sent a cable to respondent shipmaster Bisula informing him of
the procedure to be followed in the computation of special compensation of
crewmembers while in ITF controlled ports and expressed regrets for not having
earlier clarified the procedure as it thought that the vessel would trade in
Carribean ports only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On March 22, 1979, the
petitioner sent another cable informing Bisula of the special compensation when
the ship would call at Kwinana, Australia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The following day,
shipmaster Bisula cabled Vir-jen stating that the officers and crews were not
interested in ITF membership if not paid ITF rates and that their only demand
was a 50 percent increase based on their then salaries.  Bisula also pointed out that Vir-jen rates
were "very far in comparison with other shipping agencies in Manila."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In reply, Vir-jen counter
proposed a 25 percent increase.  Only
after Kyoei Tanker Co., Ltd., declined to increase the lumps sum amount given
monthly to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Vir-jen was the
decision to terminate the respondents' employment formulated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The facts show that
Vir-jen initiated the discussions which led to the demand for increased
wages.  The seamen made a proposal and
the petitioner answered with a counter­proposal.  The ship had not yet gone to Australia or any ITF controlled port.  There was absolutely no mention of any
strike, much less a threat to strike.  The seamen had done no act which under Philippine law or any other civil­ized
law would be termed illegal, oppressive, or mali­cious.  Whatever pressure existed, it was mild
compared to accepted and valid modes of labor activity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">We reiterate our ruling
in <u>Wallem</u>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner claims that the dismissal of private respondents
was justified because the latter threatened the ship authorities in acceding to
their demands, and this constitutes serious misconduct <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

terms of the Special Agree­ment, to honor and respect the same.  They were only acting in the exercise of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Our dismissing the
petition is premised on the as­sumption that the Ministry of Labor and
Employment and all its agencies exist primarily for the working­man's interests
and, of course, the nation as a whole.  The points raised by the Solicitor-General in his com­ments reefer to
the issue of allowing </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">what the
petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">importunes under the
argument of "killing the hen which lays the golden eggs".  This is one of policy which should perhaps
be directed to the Batasang Pambansa and to our country's other policy makers
for more specific legislation on the matter, subject to the constitutional
provisions protecting labor, promoting social justice, and guaranteeing non-abridgement
of the freedom of speech, press, peaceable assembly and petition.  We agree with the movants that there is no
showing of any cause, which under the Labor Code or any current applicable law,
would warrant the termination of the respondents' services before the
expiration of their contracts.  The
Constitution guarantees State assur­ance of the rights of workers to security
of tenure.  (Sec. 9, Article II,
Constitution).  Presumptions and
provisions of law, the evidence on record, and fundamental State policy all
dictate that the motions for reconsideration should be granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motions for reconsideration are hereby
GRANTED.  The petition is DISMISSED for
lack of merit.  The decision of the
National Labor Relations Commission is AFFIRMED.  No Costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DE CASTRO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Being the <u>ponente</u> of the <u>Wallem</u> case, upon whose
ruling the decision of the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in this case is mainly
made to rest, at least insofar as said Court now finds that the respondent seamen
have not com­mitted any misconduct which would constitute a just cause for the
termi­nation of their services just after three months of the 12-month term of
their contract, a brief explanation why I voted in the Second Division in favor
of the petitioner company in the instant case, and not the respondent seamen,
as I did in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Wallem </span>case, is
obviously called for.</p>

<p class="BODY">During our deliberations in the Second Division, it was made
clear that in the instant case, threat was employed by the seamen against the
company or shipowners to obtain consent to the 50% raise of wages as proposed
by the seamen upon being informed that they would touch on ITF-controlled
ports.  I joined my colleagues in the
Second Division in concurring in the decision penned by Justice Barredo, now
retired, in the belief that threat was indeed committed, constituting a just
cause for termination of the services of the seamen with still nine months to
go of their 12-month contract with the petitioner.  As the facts are more thoroughly and accurately presented and
discussed in the decision so brilliantly written by Justice Gutierrez, I am
persuaded that on the basis of the ruling of the Wallem case, a mistake was
committed in finding the existence of a just cause for the instant and unexpected
termination of the services of the seamen.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case show that to the proposal of the seamen
for a 50% increase, made because they were informed that they would touch on
ITF-controlled ports, the company countered with an offer of only 25%
raise.  The proposal of 50% was much
lower than the rates which the ITF would surely force upon the company.  When the company made a counter proposal of
25% raise the seamen accepted.  The trip
went on smoothly until upon arriving at a port which afforded haven and safety
to the shipowner, the latter suddenly, and with imperious finality, terminated
the services of the seamen and repatriated them to Manila.  These are the simple facts that call for the
application of the law, mainly the pro­visions of the Labor Code.  That law is none other than what is
indicated in how the Wallem case was decided--in vindication of how the seamen
were given a raw deal in being lulled into a false sense of security in their
employment contract only to be rudely terminated and ordered repatriated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In the Wallem case, the
seamen pressed their demand for the enforcement of a special agreement entered
into by the shipowner or company with the ITF.  For this act, their services were terminated and they were repatriated
by their employer shipping company.  What the First Division said in favor of the seamen, is in my opinion,
the correct ruling which We should reaffirm in the instant case.  Thus -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner claims that the dismissal of private respondent
was justified because the latter threatened the ship authorities in acceding to
their demands, and this constitutes serious misconduct as contemplated by the
Labor Code.  This contention is not
well-taken.  <u>But even if there had
been such a threat, respondents' behavior should not be censured because it is
but natural for them to employ some means of pressing </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">their demands o</span>n petitioner</u>, who
refused<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">abide with the terms of the Special
Agreement, to honor and respect the same.  They were only acting in the exer­cise of their rights, and to deprive
them of their freedom of expression is contrary to law and public policy.  There is </span>no serious <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">misconduct to speak of in the case at bar
which would justify respondents' dismissal just because of their firmness in
their demand for the fulfillment by petitioner of its obligation it entered
into without any coercion, specially on the part of private respondents."
(Underscoring supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This above ruling is the law on the matter and, in my opinion,
controlling on the case at bar.  Whatever
policy may prove more beneficial to the cause of labor in general, as is sought
to be offered as argument in support of the Second Division decision, is not a
proper ground for making said policy prevail over the applicable law or
jurisprudence.  Questions of policy are
better left to the Batasan Pambansa.  We
should confine ourselves to applying the law as it is.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In </span>so
doing, We are not allowed to apply it to suit, or to respond to, the demands of
what We may deem the better policy than what the law clearly intends.  The policy is the law, and the law is the
policy.  We might be treading on
forbidden ground to bend the law to what We perceive to be a desirable policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Courts are called upon only to apply the law.  Does the law permit the termination of the
services of the seamen in violation of their contract except only upon a just
cause?  This is the only <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">question </span>to be answered in this
case.  The answer is given with eloquent
persuasiveness in the decision in which I concur wholeheartedly.</p>
