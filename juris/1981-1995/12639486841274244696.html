				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ALEXANDER A. QUIDILLA, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REGALADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The accused-appellant stands charged with two crimes of rape, perpetrated against the same victim on two different occasions, in two sworn complaints both subscribed by the offended party on May 23, 1985 and which, except for the dates of commission, are identically worded, thus:<br><br><i>Criminal Case No. 2856</i><br><blockquote>"That on or about the second week of March, 1985, in the City of Laoag, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, Alexander A. Quidilla, by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there wilfully and unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the complainant, Yaniza G. Sena, a minor girl of 11 yrs. old.<br><br>"CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><i>Criminal Case No. 2855</i><br><blockquote>"That on or about the third week of March 1985, in the City of Laoag, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused Alexander Quidilla by means of force, violence, intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the complainant, Yaniza C. Sena, a minor girl of 11 years old.<br><br>"CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>Joint trial was conducted, on a plea of not guilty to both indictments, and on June 22, 1987 the trial court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> rendered a joint decision finding appellant guilty of rape in both cases, the dispositive portion stating:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape in Crim. Case No. 2856 and Crim. Case No. 2855. Were it not for the provisions of the New Constitution that death penalty could not be imposed, the Court would not hesitate for a moment to impose the death penalty on the accused in Crim. Case No. 2856. The accused is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua in each case (Crim. Case No. 2856 and Crim. Case No. 2855) to be served successively, with all the disqualifications attached to the penalty. He is hereby ordered to pay the amount of P20,000 as moral damages for each case, or a total of P40,000 to Yaniza Sena. The accused is deemed to have started serving his first sentence on May 25, 1985, when he was detained.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote>This case is now before us on the following lone assignment of error, <i>viz:</i><br><blockquote>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED GRAVELY IN CONVICTING THE DEFENDANT APPELLANT FOR RAPE IN BOTH CASES: INSTEAD OF CONVICTING THE SAID APPELLANT FOR ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS IN THE FIRST INCIDENT AND OF NOT ACQUITTING HIM IN THE SECOND INCIDENT."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>As is to be expected in prosecutions for rape, where there are no third-party witnesses and the versions of the offended party and the accused are invariably disparate and conflicting, conviction or acquittal inevitably rests mainly on the credibility of either of the parties,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> unless there are additional physical evidence or collateral facts of substantial evidentiary weight. <i>Apropos</i> thereto is the settled rule that the factual findings of trial courts are generally not disturbed on appeal in the absence of showing that they have plainly overlooked facts of substance and value which, if considered, may affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> On these considerations, the testimonies of the complainant and the appellant are set out at length, being in themselves revelatory of their vulnerability <i>vel non to</i> incisive judicial scrutiny.<br><br>The narration by the complainant of the first rape, subject of Criminal Case No. 2856, is reproduced in the aforesaid decision of the Court <i>a quo</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>, with the following essential portions culled

The defense of the appellant to this second charge was one of alibi, that is, that he locked and left the bodega at 5:30 that afternoon and at the time of the alleged rape he was already in his house at Nabutas, supposedly some five kilometers away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>It is hard to believe that complainant, who was then only a little over eleven years of age, naive and inexperienced in the ways of the world, would fabricate these charges of rape against the appellant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>, especially in the complete absence of any reason or motive whatsoever for her to do so. As this Court has observed, it has long been a matter of judicial experience that no young Filipina of decent repute will publicly admit that she has been criminally ravished unless that is the truth,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> for her natural instinct is to protect her honor,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and there is nothing to even intimate that the complainant is an exception.<br><br>The insinuations of appellant that the complainant consented to the liberties on her person is a futile and inutile subterfuge; it completely loses sight of the fact that being less than twelve years of age, such consent produces no legal effect in a prosecution for rape, even assuming ex gratia argumenti that it was given by complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The defense of alibi of the appellant on the second charge is just as unavailing. Alibi cannot be given credence where there is a clear and positive identification of the culprit by the victim. This is especially true where it has not been established that it was physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> As a specific refutation of the alibi of appellant, it has been held that the defense of alibi cannot be believed where the distance at that time between the alleged whereabouts of the accused and the scene of the crime was only eight kilometers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>All things considered, the tender age of the complainant further lends credibility to her testimony. For as this Court has held: "Moreover, if there is, anything apparent from our past decisions on rape cases, with the offended parties being young and immature girls from the ages of twelve to sixteen, it is that there is considerable receptivity on the part of this Tribunal to lend credence to their version of what transpired, considering not only their relative vulnerability but also the shame and embarrassment to which such a gruelling experience as a court trial, where they are called upon to lay bare what perhaps should be shrouded in secrecy, did expose them to. This is not to say that an uncritical acceptance should be the rule. It is only to emphasize that skepticism should be kept under control."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Uncompromising judicial sanctions should stem the growing tide of paraphilia that seeks the youth for its victims, leaving inevitable traumatic and psychological scars on their young and innocent lives.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, with costs against the accused-appellant.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Melencio-Herrera, (Chairman), Paras, Padilla,</i> and <i>Sarmiento, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exhibit B.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Exhibit C.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Regional Trial Court of Ilocos Norte &amp; Laoag City, Branch XI (Judge Felipe G.
