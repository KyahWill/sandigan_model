L-36759, <st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1972</st1:date>,
166 SCRA 355, where our learned Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando said:</p>

<blockquote>"The difficulty, recognized and acknowledged, in the
decision-making process where the prosecution is for rape, arises from the fact
that usually only the participants can testify as to the alleged sexual abuse.
The accused may deny such an occurrence, put up the defense that he was
somewhere else, or allege the consent on the part of the complainant. The court
then is left with no choice but to exert the utmost effort to determine the
likelihood that a sexual act did take place and under what cir­cumstances. Such
choice is not always easy.” <span class="GramE">(At p. 357.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above quotation has complete relevance to the case at bar
where only the complainant and the accused gave direct oral evidence on the
alleged sexual incident and the latter claimed that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

more ferocious, trying hard to force his organ inside hers. To avoid
penetration, <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> continued to move and struggle.

although that was the crime actually committed, but only for attempted rape, to
avoid public humiliation (pp. 63-68, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1978</st1:date>). When complainant's

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Contraposed</span> to the above is the

<span class="SpellE">Marabut</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.
Their houses are just about ten (10) meters away from each other. As early as
July, 1976, accused-appellant frequented the house of the complainant almost
daily to drink tuba which she sells in her store at her house. <span class="SpellE">Herminia's</span> husband, Antonio Java, was not then at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> as he left the
place for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> more than a year
before <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">July, 1976. On those occasions
that accused Eddie <span class="SpellE">Grefiel</span> was in the house of <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> Java to drink tuba, she would tell Eddie <span class="SpellE">Grefiel</span> to bring squid and fish to be made into '<span class="SpellE">kinilaw</span>' and <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> he would
bring fish and squid to <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>, the latter would
tell him to come back to her house to have a drinking spree. These frequent
visits of Eddie <span class="SpellE">Grefiel</span> have developed between him
and <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> Java an intimacy that eventually the two
ended as lovers. For the first time they consummated their carnal desire for
each other in that coconut plantation of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span> <span class="SpellE">Dacquittal</span> located a few meters away from the house of <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>. The place became the usual place of rendezvous
for the two as several other meetings took place thereat at two or three <span class="GramE">days</span> interval.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
about four instances however, accused and <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>

about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning. <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> Java and her daughter were in the house but not <span class="SpellE">Herminia's</span> mother-in-law who was in the mountain then. <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> would join in the drinking but would stand up when
somebody would buy in the store. It was about noontime while <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> Java was washing the glasses at the kitchen when
the accused Eddie <span class="SpellE">Grefiel</span> told <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>
to go to the usual place at <span class="SpellE">Daquittal's</span> coconut
plantation. She agreed and Eddie returned to the table where they were
drinking. When <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> Java was about to go out of
the house, she made signs to Eddie that she was already going to the place.
Eddie did not immediately follow <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> but waited

SENTENCING HIM TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA." (Brief, p.
1.)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The assignment of errors raises only one issue: which version is
more credible?</p>

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction and in other countries where the law has
developed beyond the primitive stage, "It is a fundamental rule that
conclusions and findings of fact by the trial court are entitled to great
weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless for strong and cogent
reasons, because the trial court is in a better position to examine real
evidence, as well as to observe the demeanor of the witnesses while testifying
in the case." (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Balili</span>, L-38250,
August 6, 1979, 92 SCRA 552, 560-561.) This case is covered by the fundamental
rule; the appeal must be dismissed; and the judgment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of the lower court must be affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The appellant questions <span class="SpellE">Herminia's</span> claim that she was raped in the coconut
plantation of <span class="SpellE">Remegia</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquittal</span>.
He says that the site of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the alleged </span>rape
is near several houses, including <span class="SpellE">Herminia's</span>, and
people pass it in going to their farms. But no less than the appellant in his
own statement of facts says that the <span class="SpellE">Daquittal</span>
coconut plantation <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>the venue
of their first and other sexual encounters. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">This is </span>what the appellant's brief says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"These frequent visits of Eddie <span class="SpellE">Grefiel</span>
have developed between him and <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> Java an inti­macy
that eventually the two ended as lovers. For the first time they consummated
their carnal desire for each other in that coconut plantation of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span> <span class="SpellE">Daquittal</span> located a few
meters away from the house of <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>. The place
became the usual place of rendezvous for the two as several other meetings took
place thereat at two or three days interval."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, it passes understanding how the
appellant can claim that the venue was unsuitable for the crime of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The appellant's claim
that he and <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> were lovers is too crude to be
convincing. As the trial court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is no doubt that the sexual inter­course was
accomplished through force. The torn portions of the maternity dress (Exhibits
"A-1" and "A-2") complainant was wearing at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the time of the incident attest to said fact.
Although no other physical evidence of force is shown on record other than the
torn dress and of course the statement of the complainant to that effect, there
is also no evidence satisfactorily belying the same."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant asks why <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> did not
report the rape to her husband's brothers-in-law. Her explanation is
reasonable; she said:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY DE VEYRA</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>And what happened <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">when you returned </span>to your house?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>I did nothing. I only changed my dress and I
did not tell them because I was afraid they were all men and besides my
mother-in-law was in the farm.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>ATTY. DE VEYRA</blockquote>

<blockquote>The interpretation
would be - I did not inform them because my mother-in-law was in the farm. They
were drinking in the kitchen I just went <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">up
the </span>house passing the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> and changed my
dress. I did not say anything for fear that there might be a fight." (TSN,
August 1, 1977, pp. 14-15.)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> reported
the rape to her mother?in-law <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>soon as the latter arrived home on the same day. This circumstance
belies the appellant's claim that he was having an affair with <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The appellant also asks
why she initially filed a complaint for attempted rape only. This was very well
explained by her as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ATTY DE VEYRA</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q
Now, Mrs. Java you stated that instead of filing a case of consummated rape you
merely filed a case of attempted rape for the first time. Will you please tell
us why you filed a case of attempted instead of consummated rape?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>First, it was very shameful and secondly, I
was afraid my husband might not return any more especially that I was about to
give birth.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>When you filed a case for attempted rape where
was your husband?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>He was in Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Now, you also stated that you need the
amendment of your first complaint from attempted rape to consummated rape. What
were your reasons that made you amend your complaint from attempted rape to
rape?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>I changed that attempted rape to rape because
my husband interrogated me about that case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>And what did your husband say if you remember?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A
<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>He said to me, ‘because you are my wife you
tell me all the truth.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Only that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Then I told him that the act was consummated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>What was the reaction of your husband, if any?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A
<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>He did not harm me because that was not
my voluntary act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>When you went to the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Marabut</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> to amend the
complaint, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was
</span>your husband with you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>You also stated on cross examination that you
did not submit to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>physician
for examination. Why did you not submit?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Because <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">they
only got a local midwife '<span class="SpellE">hilot</span>' </span>as I was
about to have a miscarriage." (TSN, January 4, 1978, pp. 31-33.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have said that the findings and conclusions of the trial court
should as a rule not be disturbed. The trial court's action is well?grounded.
It said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is quite difficult for the Court to believe that <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> Java, a young married woman with two children, a
second year com­merce student of the Divine Word University, four months
pregnant at the time of the inci­dent would publicly disclose through the
filing of the case, that s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">he </span>has
been raped thus sullying her honor and reputation in the com­munity and undergo
the trouble and humiliation of a trial if her motive was not to bring to
justice the person who wrong her."</blockquote>
