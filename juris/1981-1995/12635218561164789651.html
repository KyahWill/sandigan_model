This is a petition for review of the resolution of the Workmen's 
Compensation Commission (WCC) dated June 9, 1971 declaring private 
respondent Arellano's right to compensation benefits for disability due 
to pulmonary tuberculosis under a final and partially executed decision 
of the WCC, as not affected by his subsequent separation (retirement) 
from the service by his employer, the Social Security System (SSS), for 
absences that were precisely caused by his illness.
<p>
When Leonor Arellano was still working as a clerk in the Claims 
Department of the Social Security System, he contracted pulmonary 
tuberculosis on the basis of which he filed a claim for disability 
compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act.  On January 20, 1970,
 the WCC hearing officer rendered a decision declaring Arellano's 
disability work-connected and ordering the SSS to pay the claimant 
P1,933.99 plus a weekly compensation of P52.27 beginning on January 21, 
1970 until the disability ceases, which weekly compensation shall not 
exceed P6,000.
</p><p>
The SSS moved for a reconsideration of the decision.  In a decision 
dated August 11, 1970, the WCC chairman denied the motion and ordered 
the SSS to pay the claimant P3,449.82 as compensation benefits under 
section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act from May 7, 1969 to August 
11, 1970, and weekly thereafter, the sum of P52.27 until his disability 
for labor ceases, but the total compensa­tion shall not exceed P6,000.
</p><p>
In compliance with the above decision, the SSS paid the claimant 
P3,449.82 but did not pay the adjudged weekly compensation.  Hence, in 
March 1971, the claimant filed with the WCC an "Ex-Parte Motion to 
Declare Balance of Compensation Benefits under Section 14 of the Act as 
Due and Demandable." There being no opposition nor even a manifestation 
filed by the SSS, the WCC chairman issued an order dated April 23, 1971 
granting the Ex-Parte Motion and ordering the SSS - in implementation of
 the two previous ­WCC decisions mentioned above - to pay the claimant 
the sum of P1,904.12 as compensation benefits from August 12, 1970 to 
April 23, 1971; and thereafter, a weekly compen­sation of P52.27 until 
his sickness is declared arrested, but the total compensation benefits 
shall not exceed P6,000.
</p><p>
Soon after the issuance of the above adverse WCC order, the SSS 
Administrator wrote Mr. Arellano a letter dated December 23, 1970, as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In view of your prolonged absence due to ill health, you are 
hereby informed that you are dropped from the roll of employees of the 
System, effective immediately."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It bears emphasis that although the above letter was be­latedly 
dispatched, the termination of Mr. Arellano's services was made 
retroactive to December 23, 1970.
</p><p>
Thereafter, i.e., on May 31, 1971, the SSS filed with the WCC a Motion 
for Clarification and/or Reconsideration, inquiring as to the effect of 
claimant's retirement from the SSS on the WCC order of April 23, 1971.  
On June 9, 1971, the WCC chairman promulgated the now assailed 
resolution declaring that "claimant's retirement does not at all relieve
 the respondent from payment of compensation due him," from which the 
instant appeal by way of petition for review has been filed.
</p><p>
The petition must fail, quite apart from the fact that the issue (as to 
the effect of the dismissal of private respondent upon his entitlement 
to compensation benefit) was tardily raised by the SSS in a mere motion 
for clarification and/or reconsideration after the decision awarding the
 same had become final and had in fact been partially paid by the SSS.
</p><p>
Section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Act provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "<em>Total disability.</em> - In case the injury or sickness 
causes temporary total disability for labor, the employer shall, during 
such disability, pay to the injured employee a weekly compensation 
equivalent to sixty per centum of his average weekly wage bur not less 
than fourteen pesos per week...  Such weekly payments shall in no case 
continue after the disability has ceased, nor shall the aggregate sum 
paid as compensation exceed in any case six thousands pesos."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Compensation benefit is premised on loss or impairment of earning 
capacity due to illness or injury during a period of employment.  Hence,
 it may be conceded that entitlement thereto, as a rule, presupposes the
 existence of employer-employee relationship.  (Hernandez vs. Work­men's
 Compensation Commission, 14 SCRA 219.) Nevertheless, once compensation 
benefits are awarded and the award becomes final, the employer's 
liability cannot be aborted by his unilateral act of terminating the 
services of his disabled or sick employee, especially if the ground 
invoked therefor is absence which was precisely caused by the disability
 for which compensation benefits had been awarded.  If the rule were 
otherwise, the employer would have it within its power to unilaterally 
extinguish his own liability at the expense of his hapless employees.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the assailed resolution of the Workmen's Compensation 
Commission dated June 9, 1971 is affirmed.  Costs against the 
petitioner.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera,</em> (<em>Acting Chairman</em>), <em>Relova, Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and <em>De La Fuente</em> JJ., concur.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee</em>, J., (<em>Chairman</em>), on official leave.
