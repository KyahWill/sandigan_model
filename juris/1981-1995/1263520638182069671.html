Mateo <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span> went to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was only roused from sleep at dawn when
his uncle <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span>
woke him up at 3:00 or 4:00 o'clock in the morning and told him he was looking
for his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>; that said uncle asked him where he
tied his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> and he told his uncle he tied it
near the house and accompanied his uncle and showed him where he tied the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>; that after he indicated the place where he tied
the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> the night before, his uncle requested him
to help him to look for the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> and they went
around the place in order to locate it; that after searching for the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> this accused decided to drop at the house of his

night after telling his wife about the lost <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
he saw people east of their house and thinking that they found the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> he was looking for went there and as he was
approaching the group of people someone lighted his face with a flash light and
it was Pat. <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> holding a gun who asked him where he
was going and this accused told him he was looking for a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>;
that when he was asked if he did not know what happened in the place he
answered he did not know anything because he was only looking for his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.</blockquote>

testified accusing him and his two brothers Benito and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span>
as the authors of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He answered
that Virginia hated them because one week before the incident, she went to the
house of Benito <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span> to borrow money and rice

but his brother did not give her what she want to ask for because Benito had

breakfast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They finally found the lost <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 o'clock</st1:time>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Alibi being easily
susceptible of concoction and a very common defense in criminal cases, we
reiterate the rule that to be accorded credence, it does not suffice for the
appellant to merely prove that he was at some other place but also that the
distance was such as to preclude the possibility for him to be at the scene of
the crime at the time it was committed (People v. Romero, 119 SCRA 234; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Gacho</span>, G.R. No. 60990, Sept. 23, 1983).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case before us, the houses where the

<blockquote>"Benito <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span> claims that in the
evening of <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1980</st1:date>,
he went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Arnidobal</span> to gamble.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He said he went there between <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30</st1:time>
and <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> and went home at <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12:00 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He declared that they played 'Lucky 9' and
later '<span class="SpellE">Pusoy</span>' and they were 8 in all including one <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Arnidobal</span>,
brother of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Arnidobal</span>,
also testified for the defense that he was one of those who played in the house
of his brother <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Arnidobal</span>
in the evening of June 15, 1980 and the people in the house who played were <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span>, Pablo Salinas,
Benito <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Marron</span>, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Marron</span>, <span class="SpellE">Idot</span> <span class="SpellE">Marron</span>
and himself or seven persons in all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
also mentioned that the game they played was '<span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>'
contrary to what Benito <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span> declared that they
played 'Lucky 9' and later '<span class="SpellE">Pusoy</span>'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arnidobal</span> did not
mention the presence of one <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span> as one among the players.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was positive that there were only 7 who
played that night in the house of his brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Benito <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span> said that they were 8 including
<span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is possible that <span class="SpellE">Arnidobal</span>
forgot the presence of <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span>
but certainly he could not have mistakenly stated that the name of the gage
they played was '<span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>' if, indeed, they played this
game.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Benito <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span>
likewise could not have forgotten or mistakenly stated that they played 'Lucky
9' and later '<span class="SpellE">Pusoy</span>' if, indeed, they played these
games.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The variance in the testimony of
these witnesses on the same matter is material and relevant and cast doubt on
the veracity of their testimonies.</blockquote>

to sleep and he had just slept when Pat. <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> went to
their house and inquired from him if he knew about the killing of two persons
in their <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> and after answering him that he did
not know anything he went back to sleep and woke up only at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> the following morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He only learned they were suspected as the
killers of the two dead persons, Nestor <span class="SpellE">Megallon</span> and
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Tomines</span>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00
 o'clock P.M.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="6">June 16,
 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is impossible to
believe this testimony of accused Benito <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span> because
the killing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the two victims
happened very close to his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Incidents like this in the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span> spread
like wildfire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12:00 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
there were already policemen and many people were in the vicinity of his house
where the killing took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
therefore, impossible that Benito <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span> could not
have seen the people in the vicinity as he proceeded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span class="SpellE">Arnidobal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">His alleged reaction after Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>
inquired from him if he knew anything about the killings is likewise
unbelievable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">How </span>could he have gone back to sleep
and woke up only at 6:00 o'clock in the morning with police authorities and so
many people near his house watching 2 dead persons?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is preposterous."</blockquote>

it was <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1980</st1:date>
because before she took the witness stand the defense counsel told her it was <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is possible that <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span>
