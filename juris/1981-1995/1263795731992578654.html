</span>A compromise agreement between the parties in CC#8714 was presented but

ownership, which is within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the
Regional Trial Court (RTC) and that the offer of a counter</span>bond by
Marciano Arellano cannot dissolve the injunction not being coupled with a clear
legal right of possession over the land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Denied by the lower court of his motion for
reconsideration, defendant Marciano Arellano filed his petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and/or injunction with preliminary mandatory injunction and damages
to invalidate the Orders issued by the trial court in Civil Case No. 15085 with
the Intermediate Appellate Court (now known as the Court of Appeals) relying on
the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"The respondent Judge exceeded his
juris­diction and/or gravely abused his discretion as amounting to lack of
jurisdiction when he granted the writ of preliminary injunction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondent Judge acted without
juris­diction when he took cognizance of Civil Case No. 15085."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sustaining the trial court's authority in taking cognizance of
the complaint, the appellate court declared <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"While the complaint in Civil Case No. 15085 is captioned
'Annulment of Decision in Civil Case No. 8714 - RTC and all Posterior
Proceedings thereafter....', the action in reality is one for the vindication
of right of ownership of a third party on a property which was levied in
execution, for 'it is not the caption of the pleading, but the allega­tions
thereof that determine the nature of the action; that even without the prayer
for a specific remedy, proper re­lief may nevertheless be granted by the court
if the facts alleged in the complaint and the evidence introduced so
warrant'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Chacon Enterprises vs. Court
of Appeals, 124 SCRA 784).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that vein,
the action prays for judgment declaring inoperative the levy and sale on
execution against the property in question and for an award of damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This cause of action is a proper remedy for
the aggrieved third party x x x" (Dilag children).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As </span>to the other
issue, the Appellate Court sided with the petitioner Marciano Arellano
(respondent herein) on the latter's contention that the conveyance relied upon
by the Dilag children in giving them title to the property is a simulated sale
between them and their parents (the former owners of Lot No. 288) on November
21, 1973.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Appellate Court took into
consideration the following circumstances:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>1) in 1979, years after the alleged sale in 1973 a contract of lease
over the lot in question was executed by the Dilag spouses (parents of the
Dilag children) in favor of David Diancin, clearly an act akin to ownership of
the Dilag spouses; 2) in 1981, the same property was again the subject of a
deed of sale from the Dilag spouses in favor of their children for an
insufficient consideration or value of P30,000.00 for an area of 21 hectares
when said land was mortgaged to Develop­ment Bank of the Philippines on June 6,
1973 for P86,300.00; 3) on July 7, 1983, Sussie Dilag purportedly in behalf of
the other Dilag children executed a notarial rescission of the lease contract
entered into between the Dilag spouses and Diancin in 1979, an indication that
there was a valid contract <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>lease
entered into in 1979 by the legal owners, the spouses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Pablo </span>and Socorro Dilag with David Diancin, and 4) in 1983 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>leasehold right was waived by
David Diancin the lessee, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>favor
of Marciano Arellano in consideration of P38,000.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and </span>Arellano, in turn, sold the property to Marcelino Florete fo<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">r</span> P150,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The appellate court ruled

Arellano was executed on August 30, 1982, by virtue of the failure of the
former owners to redeem the property within the period prescribed by law, the
actual possessor was David Diancin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
however recognized Arellano's right of ownership when he was notified of the
delivery of possession to Arellano by the Provincial Sheriff as evidenced by a
signed delivery receipt, dated December 12, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dian­cin ceased performing acts of
cultivation on the fishpond situated within the lot in question and he merely
requested for an extension of his stay while he looked for another place to

<p class="BODY">Likewise it cannot be denied that in securing the can<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:34.0pt">ce</span>llation of TCT No. 30137 covering Lot
No. 288 in the names of Pablo and Socorro Dilag, petitioners had to rely on ano­ther
deed of absolute sale supposedly executed by their parents in their favor in
1981, instead of relying on the first deed of sale executed in 1974, an
indication that petitioners do not really consider the 1974 deed of sale valid
and legal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case do not support petitioners' contention
that the obligation of spouses Pablo and Socorro <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

receipt of payment of the money judgment, by virtue of their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">own </span>admission thru counsel in Civil
Case No. 12832 that pay­ment was only partial and did not cover the whole
amount of the money judgment in Civil Case No. 8714.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also an undisputable fact that the compromise
agreement in Civil Case No. 8714 was denied by the trial court in its order of
October 24, 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This order of denial
had become final and execu­tory because no appeal was taken by petitioners'
predecessors­-in-interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
even assuming that petitioners became the valid and legal owners of the lot in
question by virtue of the deed of sale executed in their favor in 1981, they
