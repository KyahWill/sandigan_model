and violence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law."<sup><span style="color: red;">1</span></sup>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused during arraignment pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial and in due course of time, on <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="2">20 February 1985</st1:date>, the trial court
rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the accused Carlos <span class="SpellE">dela</span>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution tended to establish the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time>
on <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="9">6 September 1980</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> -- then barely
seven (7) years old<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a>
-- was walking through a heavy rain, alone and without an umbrella, bound for
her grandparents' house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> was passing by the Chapel in Sta. Cruz, Sta. Maria,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, the accused Carlos <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz y <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span>, a blood relative of <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> (the record does not disclose in what civil
degree), suddenly reached out from the doorway and grabbed <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
arm and pulled her inside the Chapel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the Chapel, where it was dark the lights being off, the accused led her to the
last pew, pinned her down on the pew and removed her panty.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> Accused also removed his pants and
immediately <span class="SpellE">introjected</span> or sought to <span class="SpellE">introject</span> his penis into little <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
private organ. While so engaged, the accused covered <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
mouth with his one hand and twisted her arm with his other arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused succeeded in placing his organ on top
and at least partially into <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> private part.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a>
Shortly, there­after, while the two (2) lay down on the pew, head to head, with
panty and pants on, respectively, two (2) young parishioners <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, entered the Chapel for a scheduled prayer rally and
switched on the lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> Mendoza saw <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>,
who immediately stood up almost simultaneously with the accused, dazed and
soaking wet.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a>
Another parishioner Mrs. Francisca Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
teacher in Grade I primary school, arrived in the Chapel a little later. She
too saw <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> and the accused and wondered why she
was still abroad rather than at home at such a late hour.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> Mrs. Mendoza advised <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> to go home immediately which <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On her way back to her parents'
house, <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> met <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>
Mendoza's father, <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> <span class="SpellE">Domeng</span>,
who on noticing her dazed condition accompanied her home to her doorstep.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the rally, <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> who was an
aunt of <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>, did not go home directly but went to
the house of <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> parents<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> and asked the mother why <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> was soaking wet and still not at home at that late
hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>
had left, the mother asked <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> what had
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>
then told her mother she had been violated by Carlos "<span class="SpellE">Bosyo</span>"
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, 7 September 1980, <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>
and her parents and accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> went to the office of the Police Station Commander
of Sta. Maria, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, and reported the rape of <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> by the accused and had the matter reflected on the
police blotter.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a>
In the afternoon of the same day, <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> was brought
by her parents to the National Bureau of Investigation ("NBI") office
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> for medical examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a>
The examination was conducted by Dr. Nieto M. Salvador who issued a Medico
Legal Report dated <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="9">7 September 1980</st1:date>
which set forth the following</p>

<blockquote>"<u>F</u>

<blockquote>Normally developed, fairly nourished, conscious, coherent,
cooperative, ambulatory subject.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Breasts infantile.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No evident sign of <span class="SpellE">extragenital</span> physical
injuries noted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Genital Examination:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pubic hair, absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Labia <span class="SpellE">majora</span> and <span class="SpellE">minora</span>, <span class="SpellE">coaptated</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fourchette</span>, tense.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>Conclusion:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hymen intact."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> parents, however, did not
think very much of the medical examination conducted by Dr. Salvador.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> mother
later testified in court that she believed the examination had been done
hurriedly and cursorily and haphazardly.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a> Notwithstanding the conclusion of
Dr. Salvador's report that <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> "hymen
[was] intact", <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> parents were determined
to pursue their complaint on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were not, however, able to lodge one
immediately against the accused, since the police investigator was not in his
office whenever they went to the police station.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a> Thus, on <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="9">18 September 1980</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>
and her mother went to the Philippine Constabulary Criminal Investigation
Service ("CIS") at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place> for assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> was
again examined by PC Medico-Legal officer Dr. <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Moraleda</span> who made the following</p>

<blockquote>"FINDINGS:</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>General and <span class="SpellE">Extragenital</span></u><i>:</i><u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Fairly developed, fairly nourished and coherent female
subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Breasts are undeveloped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Abdomen is flat and tight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are not external signs of recent
application of any form of trauma.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Genital</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>There is absence of pubic hair.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Labia <span class="SpellE">majora</span> are full, convex and gaping with
the pale brown labia <span class="SpellE">minora</span> presenting in
between.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On separating the same are
disclosed a congested <span class="SpellE">vulvar</span> mucosa, a tight and
intact <span class="SpellE">fourchette</span> and an elastic, fleshy-type hymen
with a deep, healed laceration at 6 and shallow, healed laceration at 3 and <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>External vaginal orifice offers strong resistance to the introduction of
the examining index finger.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Vaginal and <span class="SpellE">peri</span>-urethral smears are
negative for gram-negative <span class="SpellE">diplococci</span> and for
spermatozoa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subject is in non-virgin state physically."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense's version of the facts was simply that the rape never
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused testified that he
had come from work and stopped by and stayed at the Chapel waiting for the rain
to stop.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a>
He dozed off, he said, and upon waking up, found a child sleeping on a pew some
little distance from where he himself had fallen asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that he saw Mrs. Francisca
Mendoza talk to the child; that he had not done anything to <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>;
that he had not inserted his organ into <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
private part; and he had not removed her panty nor lain on top of her.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> bare denial was not
corroborated by any other witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> Mendoza's testimony, even if presented by the
defense, strongly suggested that something out of the ordinary had happened on
the evening of 6 September 1980 inside the Sta. Cruz Chapel; for, as noted, she
proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> home right after the prayer
rally, indicating that finding the child <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> with
the accused in the Chapel in such a condition -- soaked to the skin and dazed
-- had aroused her concern.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the testimony of the child <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> in open court was starkly simple and
straightforward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said:</p>

<blockquote>"Atty. <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court which heard <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
testimony from beginning to end, found that her statements had the ring of
truth and were convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court is not unmindful of that judicial pronouncement
deeply embedded in jurisprudence that the accusation for rape is easily made,
hard to prove, but harder to be defended by the party accused, though
innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>, 26 Phil. 262).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, it is inconceivable
and <u>it is extremely difficult for the Court to </u><u><span style="">believe that a seven year old girl,
unmotivated and so blissfully innocent, could concoct a narration such as she
testified to in Court</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That she did not complain to her Aunt or to
her teacher when the two found her in the Chapel with the accused is
understandable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was so young, just a

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We find no basis for disagreeing with the
evaluation of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant, however, insists that the charge against him had not
been established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He urges that there is significant variance between the result of the
medical examination conducted on <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> by the NBI
doctor, Dr. Nieto M. Salvador, who found <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
hymen to have been "intact" and the result of the examination
conducted a few days later by the Philippine Constabulary CIS physician, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> <span class="SpellE">Moraleda</span> who concluded
that <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> was then "in a non-virgin
state".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused submits that the
finding of Dr. Salvador should prevail over that of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Moraleda</span>
since the findings of the former were obtained barely twenty-four (24) hours
after the alleged rape had occurred while Dr. <span class="SpellE">Moraleda</span>
examined <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> some eleven (11) days after the
violation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused further argues that
even assuming the truth of <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> testimony in
open court, such testimony indicated that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
male member was merely placed on top of the private part of the victim <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> and had not passed into it,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a>
and that there was no proof at all that his male member had penetrated into the
female opening of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Apropos</u> the above argument, we note, firstly, that medical
findings are not indispensable in the prosecution of the crime of rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a>
We note, secondly, that the fact that a woman's hymen is found intact does not
show that there had been no penetration by an <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
male organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled doctrine
that the slightest penetration of the pudenda is quite sufficient for the
consummation of the crime of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People
v. Abonada</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a>
the Court pointed out that "the medical finding that the hymen is intact
does not negate rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Penetration of the
penis by entry into the lips of the female organ even without rupture or
laceration of the hymen suffices to warrant conviction for rape".<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>
Moreover, Dr. Salvador testified that he had found physical evidence of
"manipulation" of the vagina or the vestibule thereof, which is
consistent with entry into the lips of the female part of <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
use the word manipulation, what was manipulated?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
attempt to insert a finger or in some other cases wherein <u>the man attempts
to insert his erected penis on the child whose genitalia is not yet ripe</u>,
with that particular act, there is no way that the penis can go inside the <u>vaginal
opening</u> because at this age, the vaginal opening is still narrow, normal,
.5 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>In
this particular case of <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>, there were signs
that there were manipulations</u>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>I
think so because the appearance is reddish which is not normal</u>, it should
be pink­ish.”<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Moraleda's</span>
finding, upon the other hand, was that <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
hymen had in fact been lacerated, showing that there must have been <u>some</u>
penetration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Moraleda's</span> examination of <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>
took place eleven (11) days after the examination by Dr. Salvador does not
impair the credit worthiness of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Moraleda's</span>
findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is important to note,
moreover, that the testimony of the child <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span>
herself is quite consistent with the findings and testimony of both Dr.
Salvador and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Moraleda</span> that there had been <u>some</u>
penetration at least of the labia of <span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span> female
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
testimony stated, in relevant part:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE">Brigida's</span>
statement that she had felt pain in her private part would have been
incomprehensible if there had been absolutely no penetration, not even of the
labia, by the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> male organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears to the Court, that the 7-year old <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> was much too young to be capable of distinguishing
between the penis merely lying outside the vagina and on top of the pubes, from
the erect penis poking into the labia in the effort to get into the vaginal
canal, but being unable to do so because of the unripe or infantile condition
of the canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
conclusion of the trial court that there had in fact been some penetration at
least of the labia and that consequently, the crime that was committed was
consummated rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was proven at the trial that the violation of the child <span class="SpellE">Brigida</span> took place in the Sta. Cruz Chapel in Sta. Maria, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, a building dedicated to and actively used for
religious worship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The criminal
information did not apparently specify the place of the commission of the
rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the trial court could
have and should have found the presence of the generic aggravating circumstance
of commission of the offense in a place dedicated to religious worship.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a>
The trial court made no mention of such aggravating circumstance in its
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the appropriately
imposable penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
is an indivisible penalty, and was in fact imposed by the trial court, the
finding that we here make of the presence of this generic aggravating
circumstance, does not impact upon the imposable penalty.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a></p>
