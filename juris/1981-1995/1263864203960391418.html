				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, petitioner
seeks the reversal of the decision of Employees' Compensation Commission in ECC
Case No. 1953 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Nonita</span> <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> v. G.S.I.S. (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) which
affirmed the denial of death benefits under P.D. No. 626 as amended, by the
G.S.I.S. for the demise of petitioner's husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue presented before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is
whether or not the disease contracted by the deceased Felix B. <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> is work-connected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Felix B. <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> started his career
in the government on <st1:date year="1970" day="24" month="9">September 24,
 1970</st1:date> when he was extended a casual appointment as accounts clerk in
the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1975</st1:date>
he was promoted to the position of Finance Officer at the Philippine Embassy in
<st1:place><st1:city>Islamabad</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Pakistan</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among his duties were the preparation of cash
vouchers, payrolls and financial reports of the Embassy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also performed functions for the Bureau of
Internal Revenue.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1980, Felix <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> sought
medical treatment at the Armed Forces of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Philippines</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he was confined prior to his death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His attending physician, Lt. Col. <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Paragas</span>, made the following medical findings:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The present condition started a year prior to admission as
easy fatigability of the right upper extremity and with associated tremors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was noted by the patient every time he
types for some time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also noted that
there were limitations of movement as when he raises his arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arm has lost strength whenever he handles
objects (which are a little bit heavy) and when the arms are outstretched.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also noted that there was involuntary
movement of the muscles of the arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Six
months later, there was also involvement of the left arm with same manifestations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was also 6 months prior to admission that
the patient noted gradual progressive diminution in muscle size of both upper
extremities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A private physician was
consulted and "<span class="SpellE">negriton</span>" tabs (1 tab TID)
were prescribed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He took said medication
for a month for which the easy fatigability of the upper extremity was
relieved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two weeks prior to admission
patient sought consultation with LTC <span class="SpellE">Pajarillo</span> in
which "<span class="SpellE">neurobion</span>" was prescribed and the
latter advised the patient on hospitalization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, patient came in for further evaluation and management".</p>

<p class="BODY">Lamentably, hospitalization proved futile.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1981</st1:date>, just a few weeks after his discharge from the hospital,
Felix <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> succumbed to his illness diagnosed
as Progressive Muscular Dystrophy, limb-girdle type.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was 55 years of age.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nonita</span> <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span>,
decedent's surviving spouse, filed a claim for death benefits with the
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS for brevity) <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
as a respondent herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of
the recommendation given by its medical evaluation and underwriting group (Rec.)
GSIS denied said claim on the ground that decedent's ailment was not due to
circumstances of the performance of the duties and responsibilities of his
employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">After her motion for reconsideration was denied, petitioner
elevated her case to the respondent Employees' Compensation Commission (ECC for
brevity).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her appeal likewise proved
inutile.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this
petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that when decedent entered the public service
in 1970, Felix <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> was found to be in perfect
health and fit for work; that he was constantly subjected to physical and
mental stress brought about by the rigors of his employment; that being the
lone finance officer at the embassy, he had to spend long hours of overtime
work; that he was exposed to adverse climatic conditions since his place of
work, Islamabad, is known for its extremes of temperature; that these
employment factors must have conspired to reduce the body resistance of the
deceased and played a significant role in the development of his ailment
culminating in his death.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decisive factor in this case is whether or not petitioner's
claim is covered by the Workmen's Compensation Act or by P.D. 442 as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the law and latest jurisprudence, the Workmen's
Compensation Act shall apply only to injury, sickness, disability or death
which occurred before <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For injury, sickness, disability or death
occurring on or after <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1975</st1:date>,
P.D. 442 as <span class="GramE">amended,</span> shall apply.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleged that in 1974 the deceased's health began to
deteriorate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He started to experience
easy fatigability of the right upper extremity with associated tremors
especially whenever he was typing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the left upper extremity was also involved and then
atrophy of both upper extremities ensued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He sought medical treatment at the <st1:place><st1:placename>AFP</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>
under the professional care of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Paragas</span> who
diagnosed Felix <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo's</span> malady as
"progressive muscular dystrophy".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Her claim was supported by a medical certificate issued by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Florliza</span> J. Garcia of the AFP Medical Center on December 7,
1982, that the deceased "Felix <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> was
under the medical care of Major <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> <span class="SpellE">Paragas</span> of the Neurology Department of this Medical Center <u>in
1974</u> for <u>Progressive Muscular Dystrophy</u> which was contracted (sic)
by the deceased while employed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that neither the G.S.I.S. nor the E.C.C.
questioned the above certification much less rebutted the presumption of
regularity thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
public respondents laid too much stress on the medical evaluation of the
disease as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The limb-girdle type of progressive muscular dystrophy
involves the shoulder and pelvic girdles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It occurs usually in the second and third decade of life and
occasionally late in the first decade or in middle life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is transmitted <span class="GramE">as an <span class="SpellE">autosomol</span> recessive characteristics</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Primary involvement of the shoulder and girdle is noted with
spread to the other after a variable period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Severe disability is usually present 20 years after onset.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Muscular contraction and skeletal deformity
come on late in the course of the disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most patients become severely disabled in middle life and the life span
is shortened."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">This served to corroborate petitioner's
statement that the onset of her husband's ailment was in 1974, much earlier
than in 1980 when he was confined in the hospital and eventually succumbed to
his ailment.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the above-cited medical evaluation, the disease
"occurs usually in the second and third decade of life and occasionally
late in the first decade or in middle life." The deceased died at the age
of 55 years, giving credence to petitioner's claim that her husband's early
symptoms were noticed in 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the
very nature of the ailment, it could not have been instantly acquired in
1980.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the deceased was
hospitalized, severe disability had already set in, the last stages of the
disease which by the very findings of the G.S.I.S and ECC is usually present 20
years after onset.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly then, subject
illness occurred prior to <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="1">January 1,
 1975</st1:date>, before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Labor
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled principle that the governing law in the
prosecution of a cause of action which has accrued prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of a new law shall be the law enforced at the
time of the accrual of said cause of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the Workmen's Compensation Law was in full force and effect then, it
should govern the present case based on the principle that "rights accrued
and vested while a statute was in force ordinarily survive its repeal."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the WCA, when there is a showing that the ailment was
contracted and/or aggravated in the course of one's employment, presumption of
compensability arises and the burden of destroying this presumption is upon the
employer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that respondent employer complied with
Sections 37 and 45 of the WCA, as amended, by filing with the WCC or later with
the ECC a notice of the deceased's initial illness and subsequent death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it alleged that respondent <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the right to compensation within the
prescribed period.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly ruled that failure to comply with said
sections constitutes a renunciation of the employer's right to controvert the
claim resulting in the waiver of all its non-jurisdictional defenses, such as
the non-compensability of the claim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner invokes the ruling of the ECC in <span class="SpellE">Supnet</span> v. GSIS; ECC Case No. 1964, where said Commission,
taking note of the contributory causes of progressive muscular atrophy as to
include <u>fatigue</u>, <u>exposure to cold</u>, infection, lead poisoning and
exposure to gasoline fumes, decided in favor of a deceased teacher afflicted
with the same ailment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondents in opposing the application of the aforesaid
ruling to the case at bar, cited the fact that the <span class="SpellE">Supnet</span>
case involved physical activity aside from the regular work of a teacher in the
classroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They claim that no analogy
can be drawn to the work of a Finance Officer of the Philippine Embassy in <st1:city><st1:place>Islamabad</st1:place></st1:city>
since the same did not necessarily require exposure to the climatic changes in
his place of work.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, such argument appears untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both deceased performed multifarious
functions which generated stress and fatigue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, while the deceased was generally confined in the
office and was not directly exposed to the elements, the extremes of
temperature in Islamabad which are undisputed, and incomparable to the climate
of our country, cannot but affect <span class="SpellE">Buenconsejo</span> who
obviously had also to go out, in going to and returning from work and in
attending to his duties, which cannot be reasonably presumed to be done
exclusively within the four walls of the building.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the Solicitor General admits that under the
previous law on workmen's compensation, the circumstance that the illness
supervened during the period of employment may be considered as basis for the
legal presumption of compensability.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in consonance with the spirit of social justice and the
humane character of the law, We ruled that the exact cause of the ailment
suffered by the claimant is not significant, and the possibility that factors
other than the employment may have contributed to the development of the
ailment, is not a drawback; for what is material and decisive is that the
employment contributed even in a small degree in aggravating the ailment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while it is well-established in this jurisdiction that
findings of administrative agencies which have acquired expertise because their
jurisdiction is confined to specific matters are generally accorded not only
respect but even finality;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
one of the recognized exceptions to the general rule is that, when such
findings and the conclusions derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> are
not supported by substantial evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision sought to be reviewed is reversed
and set aside and respondent ECC is hereby ordered to pay the petitioner the
benefits allowed by the Workmen's Compensation Law.</p>
