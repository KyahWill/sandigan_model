				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GRINO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition seeks to reverse and set aside the National Labor
Relations Commission resolution dated <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="8">August
 4, 1982</st1:date> denying petitioner's appeal from the decision of the Labor
Arbiter dated <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1981</st1:date>,
directing the petitioner to reinstate the two <span style="">(2) </span>private respondents to their former positions in the
company, with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 2, 1980, the private respondents filed individual
complaints against the <span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Development Co., Inc.
("the Company" for brevity) <span style="">for </span>illegal dismissal, docketed as NCR-STF-4-2100-80,
later NCR Case No. <span class="GramE">AB-4-5446-80.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> <span class="GramE">Gonzales</span>
who had been employed since 1974 as a doffer in the company's Spinning
Department, was dismissed on <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="3">March 14,
 1980</st1:date>, for alleged abandonment of duty and gambling, based on
reports from his supervisors, <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>, and a Mr. <span class="SpellE">Escleto</span> without
being given an opportunity to refute those charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other complainant, Clarita Benson, a regular worker of the
company until December 14, 1980, was laid off because of a pre-announced
temporary shut-down of the factory starting December 17, 1979 with assurance
that she would be called back upon the resumption of work but on March 17,
1980, she received a letter from the company informing her of the termination
of her services for abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon she filed a complaint for illegal dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notification and summons were issued to the parties by the senior
labor arbitration analyst, informing them of an initial hearing on <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1980</st1:date> and that their respective
position papers should be filed at least three days prior thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The scheduled hearing <span style="">did not proceed for failure of the company's representative to
appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another notice of hearing on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="5"><span style="">May 9,
 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> was sent to the
company by telegram.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notices by telegram
for subsequent hearings scheduled for May 21, 28 and </span><st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="6"><span style="">June 10,
 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> were likewise
sent to the company, as per bailiff's returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The company's representative, however, failed to appear at any of the
hearings, prompting the complainants to move that the case be submitted for
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the private r</span>espondents
submitted their position paper.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1980</st1:date>,
the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">dispositive</span></span><span style=""> </span>portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing circumstances, complainant's charge
of illegal dismissal must be sustained in the absence of denial <span style="">or evidence to the contrary by respondent due
to the failure of its manager and/or representative to appear </span>and <span style="">submit its position paper and supporting
documents.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly,<span style=""> </span>respondent
should reinstate complainants to their respective former positions without loss
of seniority rights and with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, within ten (10) days after
receipt of this Decision, respondent ARTEX DEVELOPMENT CO., INC., is hereby
directed to reinstate complainants <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> Gonzales
and Clarita Benson to their respective former positions with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the date of their dismissal until such time
that this Decision has been complied with." <span class="GramE">(pp. 80-81, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The company filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision,
claiming that its failure to appear at the scheduled hearings was due to the
fact that it did not <span style="">receive summons nor any</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">notice of
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainants opposed the
company's motion for </span><span style="">reconsideration
and filed a </span><span style="">motion for execution of the judgment.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The existing rule (Rule VII, Section 9 <span style="">of </span>the National Labor Relations Commission Rules) was that
"no motion for reconsideration of the labor arbiter's decision shall be
entertained unless in the nature of an <span style="">appeal
to the Commission." Instead of treating respondent's motion for
reconsideration as an appeal and elevating it to the Commission, the arbiter
set the case for hearing and thereafter issued an Order dated </span><st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="7"><span style="">July 30,
 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, denying the
motion for lack of merit (p. 53, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1981</st1:date>,
the company appealed to the Commission, alleging denial of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> third
division dismissed the appeal in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="8">August <span style="">4, </span>1982</st1:date>,
stating that:</p>

<blockquote>"The records plainly show that the instant case was set for
hearing on the following dates:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May 5,
9, 21 and 28, 1980 and on <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="6">June 10,
 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notices of the same
were duly served to the respondent through telegrams, which telegrams were
fully confirmed by the Telegraph Company for the hearings on May 9, 21 and 28,
1980 (pp. 20, 21 and 22, Records).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the face of <span class="GramE">these</span> strongly convincing evidence, there
could be no room for doubt that contrary to its claim, respondent had been
accorded all the opportunities that it needed for it to present evidence in its
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its refusal to avail of the
same cannot be construed otherwise than a plain waiver of its right to do so.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the given circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot therefore disturb the decision and order in question." <span class="GramE">(p. 84, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the motions for reconsideration were denied by the National
Labor Relations Commission's Third Division and by the Commission <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u>,
the company filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i> alleging grave abuse <span style="">of </span>discretion on the part of the
labor arbiter and the NLRC for rendering judgment against the petitioner
without due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The confirmation copies of the telegraphed
notices of the various hearings before the Labor Arbiter showed that the
telegrams were properly sent and delivered in the ordinary course of
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the petitioner had not
changed its address, nor did the Telegraphic <span style="">Communication Office advise the senders (herein respondents) that the
telegrams were undelivered, and as petitioner had in fact received all copies
of the Labor </span>Ministry's resolutions and decisions sent to its <span style="">address, the presumption is that it received
the notices of hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if the petitioner was not heard at the stage of mediation
and fact-finding, it may not complain of lack of due process for it was given an
opportunity to present its side of the controversy when its motions for
reconsideration and appeal were given due course (<span class="SpellE">Maglasang</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span> et al., 63 SCRA 508; <span class="SpellE">Cuerdo</span>
v. Commission on Audit, 166 SCRA 657).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What due process abhors is not lack of previous notice, but absolute
lack of opportunity to be heard (<span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span> et al v. <span class="SpellE">Lamaroza</span>, 110 SCRA 438; <span class="SpellE">Zoleta</span> v.
<span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>, 166 SCRA 548).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, when the decision or order <span style="">of an </span>administrative agency is not
tainted with unfairness or arbitrariness, its factual findings are generally
accorded not only respect but also finality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="">finding of the Commission in
this case that the petitioner had been duly notified of the hearings before the
Labor Arbiter, and that hence it was not denied due process of law, must be
respected since it is supported by substantial evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, conformably with existing doctrine,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> the decision of the Labor Arbiter is hereby modified
by limiting the private respondents’ <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to not
more than three (3) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the petitioner.</span></p>
