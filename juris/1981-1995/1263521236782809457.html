This is a petition for <em>certiorari </em>to set aside the order and 
resolution of Minister of Labor Blas F. Ople denying the payment of 
backwages to the petitioners and the decision of the Ad Hoc National 
Labor Relations Commission considering them as temporarily laid off 
without compensation until their actual reinstatement.  This petition is
 an offshoot of an unfair labor practice case.
<p>
The background facts of the case are not in dispute.  In the words of the mediator-fact finder of the NLRC, they are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It appears that the Arrastre Security Association-TUPAS, ASA in 
short, is a duly registered labor organization with Registration 
Certificate No. 1159-IP, issued on December 22, 1954 having as members 
security employees in the arrastre service at South Harbor, Port Area, 
Manila, and was under the employ of the Delgado Brothers, Inc., Arrastre
 operator. </p>
  <p> "That the Court of Industrial Relations repeatedly certified it on
 August 6, 1955 and May 14, 1957 as the sole and exclusive contractor. </p>
  <p> "That in May, 1966 Guacods Marine Terminal and E. Razon, Inc., 
arrastre contractors, took over the arrastre service at South Harbor, 
Port Area, Manila, by virtue of winning the bid.  The former as the new 
acknowledged employers of the ASA signed their respective collective 
bargaining agreements with the latter. </p>
  <p> "That on April 11, 1972 the Court of Industrial Relations 
certified the ASA as the sole and exclusive agent of all the security 
employees of respondent Guacods Marine Terminal for purposes of 
collective bargaining as regards wages, hours of work, terms and other 
conditions of employment. </p>
  <p> "That on May 9, 1972 the Court of Industrial Relations likewise 
certified the ASA as the exclusive representative of all the watchmen 
employed with respondent E. Razon, Inc. in respect to rates of pay, 
wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment for 
collective bargaining purposes. </p>
  <p> "That on October 9, 1972 the Philippine Constabulary issued Letter
 Directive M-10, by virtue of, and pursuant to, Proclamation No. 1081, 
requiring company guards being employed by private firms companies and 
corporations to acquire the necessary 'License to Exercise Profession' 
as watchmen or security guards.  To secure such license, applicant must 
submit, among others, 'certification under oath of the 
Proprietor/personnel or Administrative Manager of firm/corporation as to
 the date the company guard was first employed and that he is still 
em­ployed by said firm/corporation. </p>
  <p> "That on October 13, 1972 the ASA sent letters to the Guacods 
Marine Terminal and E. Razon, Inc. requesting them to give the necessary
 individual certi­fication of employment to all its members security 
guard and/or watchmen. </p>
  
  <p> "That on October 13, 1972, respondent Guacods Marine Terminal in 
its reply-letter refused to ‘issue said certification of employment for 
the simple reason that we consider the members of your association as 
your employees and not that of our corporations.  However, it 
acknowledged on October 23 conference that the members of the ASA are 
their employees. </p>
  <p> "That on October 14, 1972, employer E. Razon, Inc. in its 
reply-letter likewise refused to ‘give the certificate of employment in 
view of the memorandum of October 13, 1972 of the Acting Deputy 
Commissioner of Customs'.  Nevertheless, it also acknowledged on Oct. 23
 conference among the parties before the undersigned that an 
employer-employee relationship existed between them. </p>
  <p> "That on October 13, 1972, Atty. Pedro Mendoza, Acting Deputy 
Commissioner of Customs, by virtue of the decision of the Department of 
National Defense authorities thru the chief of Staff, in consonance with
 the enforcement of Republic Act 5487 (The Private Agency Law) as 
amended by Presidential Decree No. 11, issued a memorandum for the 
commissioner of Customs directing the Customs Metropolitan Police 
Service (CMPS) to take over the function of the Arrastre Security 
Association." (Rollo, pp. 33-35) </p>

  <p> Questioning the respondent corporations’ refusal to make the 
required certifications of employment, the petitioner-union in 
representation of the 350 security guards filed with the Bureau of Labor
 Relations a "Request for Assistance In Dispute Settlement" alleging 
union busting discrimination, harassment, violation of collective 
bargaining agreement, and other acts constituting unfair labor 
practices. </p>
  <p> The request for assistance prompted the Department of Labor to 
hold an initial conference regarding the matter.  During this conference
 presided by Undersecre­tary of Labor Amado Gat Inciong, all the parties
 were represented by their respective counsel.  A concilia­tion 
conference among the parties followed. </p>
  <p>
  At the conference, the counsels for Guacods Marine Terminal and E. 
Razon Inc. manifested their willingness to issue the certifications of 
employment required before the licenses as watchmen or security guards 
would be issued by the Philippine Constabulary.  Considering the 
respondents' admission of the employee-employer relationships, the 
Secretary of Labor was informed by the Chief of his legal staff that it 
was not necessary to certify the existence of this relationship.  The 
Secretary of Labor then informed the president of the Arrastre Security 
Association that his members could proceed to secure the certifications 
from the respondents.
  </p>
  <p>
  The reinstatement of the petitioners, however, could not be effected 
because the AFP Military Supervisor told the Bureau of Customs to 
continue using the Customs Metropolitan Police Service to discharge the 
functions of the Arrastre Security Association.  As a result, the 
petitioner union filed a complaint with the Ad Hoc National Labor 
Relations Commission charging the respondent corporations with unfair 
labor practices.  It prayed that the respondent corporations:  1) be 
declared guilty of unfair labor practices; 2) be ordered to reinstate 
dismissed/locked-out members of complainant union, with full backwages 
and without loss of seniority and other employees benefits; and 3) be 
ordered to cease and desist from committing further acts of unfair labor
 practices against complainant union and members.
  </p>
  <p>
  After a preliminary fact-finding investigation, the case was assigned 
to the chief of the legal staff of the Department of Labor who was 
designated as compulsory arbitrator.  After due hearings, a decision 
finding respondent-corporations guilty of unfair labor practices was 
promulgated.  The dispositive portion of the decision reads:
  </p>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, respondents Guacods Marine Terminal and E. Razon, Inc.
 are hereby ordered to reinstate the 350 members of the Arrastre 
Security Association-TUPAS to their former jobs with full back wages 
from October 14, 1972 until actually re-instated, to cease and desist 
from further committing unfair labor practices and finally issue an 
individual certificate of employment as a requirement in procuring PC 
permit in accordance with the Private Security Agency Law, as amended."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
E. Razon, Inc., appealed the decision to the Ad Hoc Labor Relations 
Commission.  The Commission, despite the fact that Guacods Marine 
Terminal did not appeal, reviewed the whole decision.  In its decision 
dated March 22, 1973, the Commission modified the arbitrator's decision 
as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "<em>First</em>, that it was through no fault of the respondents 
that the members of the complainant union were barred from working as 
security guards at the Customs Zone starting 14 October 1972.  This 
happened because the Customs Metropolitan Service, acting pursuant to a 
Memorandum of Col. Pedro C. Mendoza, Jr., Acting Deputy Commissioner of 
Customs dated 13 October 1972, took over the functions of the said 
security guards.  The respondents, therefore, did not commit any unfair 
labor practice. </p>
  <p> "<em>Second</em>, that Col. Mendoza issued the said memorandum in 
compliance with a decision/order of top officials of the Department of 
National Defense.  In this sense, it was an act of a duly authorized 
representative of the President under martial law and was, therefore, a 
valid act of state.  It was, moreover, a necessary act in the light of 
the Government's interests and responsibilities at the Customs Zone, on 
the one hand, and, on the other, the anomalies that used to be daily 
fare therein, perpetrated by government employees and private persons 
alike, some of these in the security services not excluded. </p>
  <p> “<em>Third</em>, that the security guards involved in those 
anomalies and those who otherwise have bad records or not fit for the 
security service in accordance with the requirements thereof, have no 
place in such service, even as the rest who are honest and efficient 
deserve to be returned thereto. </p>
  <p> "<em>Fourth and last,</em> that the latter, however, may not be 
awarded backwages because, as stated earlier, this would amount to 
penalizing the respondents for a turn of events over which they had no 
control.  They should be considered as temporarily laid off without pay 
from 14 October 1973 until the date they are actually returned to work 
pursuant to this decision."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The complainant union appealed the Commission's decision to the 
Secretary of Labor but limited the appeal to that portion which struck 
out the claim for backwages from October 14, 1972 until the 350 members 
would be reinstated to their jobs.  The union appellant claimed that the
 decision was not supported by the facts, law, and jurisprudence.  For 
the first time, Deputy Customs Commissioner Pedro Mendoza was included 
as a respondent in this appeal.
</p><p>
The appeal and a subsequent motion for reconsi­deration were denied by 
the Secretary of Labor.  At the same time, the Secretary ordered the 
respondents to extend financial assistance equivalent to one month 
salary to each of the laid off workers.  This assistance was justified 
as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We believe, however, that while the law must be fully implemented
 in conformity with its letter and spirit, the same must nonetheless be 
tempered with mercy and humane considerations.  It should not be 
overlooked that the individual members of complainant union whose 
reinstatement may no longer be possible had, for many years, been in the
 service of respondents.  While they are not entirely without fault such
 that they can no longer be reinstated, much less may they qualify for 
separation pay, it would be in keeping with the social justice policy of
 the State that some measure of financial assistance be extended to 
them."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The petitioners not satisfied with the foregoing order, filed this petition and italized the following issues:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.    <em>That the Decision of Arbitrator Porfirio E. Villanueva 
dated January 26, 1973 (Annex 'E') ordering the reinstatement of 350 
individual petitioners is final and executory against respondents 
Guacods, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs and E. Razon, Inc.</em> </p>
  <p> "2.    <em>That the Decision (Amax 'E') of Arbitrator Porfirio E. 
Villanueva dated January 26, 1973 is supported by preponderant evidence 
and is in accordance with law and jurisprudence laid down by this 
Honorable Court. </em></p>
  <p> “3.   <em>That the Decision (Annex 'G') of the Ad Hoc National 
Labor Relations Commission denying the reinstatement of some of the 
individual petitioners and the non-payment of backwages is without any 
factual and legal basis, and constitutes a grave abuse of dis­cretion 
amounting to lack of jurisdiction, and is therefore null and void ab 
initio. </em></p>
  <p> “4.    <em>That the Resolution dated July 31, 1974 (Annex 'I') and
 the Order dated July 25, (Annex 'K') are capricious and whimsical, 
issued in grave abuse of discretion in excess of jurisdiction, contrary 
to and in violation of the Constitution. </em></p>
  <p> "5.    <em>That respondents Guacods and E. Razon, Inc. are guilty of unfair labor practice. </em></p>
  <p> “6.    <em>Section 11, Rule II, Book V of the Rules and 
Regulations Implementing the Labor Code of the Philippines and Article 
244 of the Labor Code of the Philippines (PD 442 as amended) is 
unconstitutional. </em></p>
  <p> “7.    <em>That individual petitioners were deprived of their property rights to employment without due process of law. </em></p>
  <p> “8.   <em>That individual petitioners are entitled to 
reinstatement with full backwages and those who cannot be reinstated due
 to old age or physical disability are additionally entitled to 
severance or termination pay. </em></p>
  <p> “9.    <em>That the defenses and arguments put up by respondents are without any basis both in fact and in law and is devoid of merits. </em></p>
  <p> “10.  <em>That petitioners are entitled to the reliefs prayed for 
and they have no other pIain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
 course of law than the instant petition. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
All of the above issues revolve around one main issue — whether or not 
the 350 complainants-petitioners may be reinstated to their former 
positions with full backwages from October 14, 1972 until actual 
reinstate­ment and whether or not the private respondents are guilty of 
unfair labor practice.
</p><p>
We first resolve two preliminary issues.  The respondents contend that 
appeals from decisions of the Secretary of Labor should be elevated to 
the President and, therefore, this Court has no jurisdiction over the 
case.
</p><p>
The contention is without merit.
</p><p>
The case before us is a petition for <em>certiorari </em>asking for the 
nullification of the Secretary of Labor's resolution affirming the 
decision of the respondent Commission and for the reinstatement of the 
arbitrator's decision.  We ruled in <em>Kapisanan Ng Mga Manggagawa Sa La Suerte Foitaf v. Noriel</em>
 (77 SCRA 414) that under the Labor Code, a jurisdictional question 
arising from an allegation of lack of power or arbitrary or improvident 
exercise of authority may be passed upon by this Court in an appropriate
 <em>certiorari </em>proceeding.
</p><p>
Earlier, we ruled in <em>San Miguel Corporation v. Secretary of Labor</em> (64 SCRA 56, 60):
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Yangley raised a jurisdictional question which was not brought up
 by public officials.  He contends that this Court has no jurisdiction 
to review the decisions of the NLRC and the Secretary of Labor ‘under 
the principle of separation of powers' and that judicial review is not 
provided for in Presidential Decree No. 21. </p>
  <p> "That contention is a flagrant error.  ‘It is generally understood
 that as to administrative agencies exercising quasi-judicial or 
legislative power there is an underlying power in the courts to 
scrutinize the acts of such agencies on questions of law and 
jurisdiction even though no right of review is given by statute' (73 
C.J.S. 506, note 56). </p>
  <p> "'The purpose of judicial review is to keep the administrative 
agency within its jurisdiction and protect substantial rights of parties
 affected by its decisions' (73 C.J.S. 507, Sec. 165).  It is part of 
the system of checks and balances which restricts the separation of 
powers and forestalls arbitrary and unjust adjudication. </p>
  <p> "Judicial review is proper in case of lack of jurisdiction, grave 
abuse of discretion, error of law, fraud or collusion (Timbancaya v. 
Vicente, 62 O.G. 9424; Macatangay v. Secretary of Public Works and 
Communications, 63 O.G. 11236; Ortua v. Singson Encarnacion, 59 Phil. 
440). </p>
  <p> "'The courts may declare an action or resolution of an 
administrative authority to be illegal (1) because it violates or fails 
to comply with some mandatory provision of the law or (2) because it is 
corrupt, arbitrary or capricious' (Borromeo v. City of Manila and 
Rodriguez Lanuza, 62 Phil. 512, 516; Villegas v. Auditor General, 18 
SCRA 877, 891)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The petitioners contend that the respondents failed to make a timely 
appeal of the arbitrator's decision to the National Labor Relations 
Commission.
</p><p>
The records show that E. Razon received the arbitrator's decision on 
February 12, 1972 and on this same day filed its appeal with the 
National Labor Relations Commission.  (p. 146, Rollo).  In its Order 
dated February 22, 1973, the National Labor Relations Commission gave 
due course to the appeal and ordered the parties to submit to the 
Commission, "x x x if they so desire, their memorandum in support of, or
 in opposition to the said Appeal within five (5) days from receipt by 
them of this Order." (Annex "2", Comment E. Razon, p. 284, Rollo) In 
compliance with the said Order, E. Razon, Inc. filed its memorandum on 
March 3, 1973.  Petitioners likewise filed their memorandum.  An 
examination of their memorandum shows that they did not raise as an 
issue the timeliness of E. Razon's appeal.
</p><p>
Moreover, the petitioners upon appeal of the National Labor Relations 
Commission's decision to the Secretary of Labor recognized the 
timeliness of E. Razon's appeal to the Commission because in their 
COMPLAINANT'S APPEAL, they merely alleged that only respondent E. Razon,
 Inc has appealed while co-respondent Guacods Marine Terminal and Acting
 Commissioner Mendoza both failed to appeal.
</p><p>
The issue of the timeliness of E. Razon's appeal from the arbitrator's 
decision to the National Labor Relations Commission surfaces only in 
this petition.  This issue being entirely new and an unpleaded matter in
 the proceedings below may not now be raised for the first time before 
this Court.  (Davao Free Workers Front v. C.I.R., 60 SCRA 508).  
Furthermore, after considering the foregoing circumstances there can be 
no doubt that E. Razon's appeal to the National Labor Relations 
Commission was within the reglementary period provided for in Section 23
 of the National Labor Relations Commission Rules and Regulations.
</p><p>
It is not mandatory that for the appeal to be perfected a memorandum 
should also be submitted within the same five-day period to appeal.
</p><p>
The argument that the arbitrator's decision has become final and 
executory against the Deputy Commissioner of Customs is out of order.  
The Deputy Commissioner of Customs was not impleaded as a respondent in 
the petitioner’s initial complaint before the Department of Labor.  
Moreover, the October 13, 1972 Memorandum issued by the Deputy 
Commissioner was not even made an issue in the said complaint.
</p><p>
Respondent Guacods, Inc. did not appeal the arbitrator's decision.  
Nevertheless, the National Labor Relations Commission "in the interest 
of justice" reviewed the whole case as if Guacods appealed for the 
reason "x x x that they (respondent corporations) are uniformly situated
 in so far as this case is concerned and, considering the whole context 
thereof, to hold otherwise would bring about an untenable situation 
which even the technical rules would frown upon."
</p><p>
It is true that a decision becomes final and executory upon the lapse of
 the period to file an appeal if no such appeal was perfected.  In the 
instant case, however, the respondent Commission was correct because the
 decision ordering reinstatement could not be enforced.  There were no 
more positions to which the security guards could be reinstated.  The 
arbitrator had rendered, in effect, a decision over a moot issue and 
against the wrong party.
</p><p>
There were also other supervening events which render the award of 
backwages and reinstatement im­possible.  In Virata v. Bocar (50 SCRA 
468) a final award to operate the arrastre services for all the piers in
 the Manila South Harbor was granted in favor of Guacod's co-respondent,
 E. Razon, Inc.  In connection with this decision, an agreement dated 
July 9, 1973 approved by the NLRC Chairman was executed among E. Razon, 
Inc., Bureau of Customs and Tupas.  The terms of the agreement are as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “1.  E. Razon will accept the eleven already licensed former GUACODS security guards subject to medical examination. </p>
  <p> “2.  E. Razon will prepare a list of acceptable former GUACODS 
security guards and then submit the list to the Bureau of Customs for 
screening.  E. Razon representatives will go over the 201 files of 
former GUACODS employees which are in possession of the Bureau of 
Customs. </p>
  <p> “3.  The screening committee will go over the list prepared by E. Razon for the purpose of updating it. </p>
  <p> “4.  All security guards approved by the Bureau of Customs shall 
have 90 days from the time of the issuance of certification of 
employment by E. Razon within which to secure licenses.  This period 
maybe modified depending upon the circumstances as verified by the 
union."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The basic ground for our affirming the resolution of the respondent 
Secretary with some clarificatory modifications is that the 350 security
 guards who filed this petition together with their union were barred 
from the customs area and their functions were turned over to the 
customs police.  This was a martial law measure taken under the then 
newly promulgated Proclamation No. 1081.  The Bureau of Customs had 
prior consultations with the Secretary of National Defense before taking
 over all security work in the customs area.
</p><p>
The memorandum barring the petitioners from customs premises effective October 14, 1972 reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "By virtue of the decision of the Department of National Defense 
authorities, thru the Chief of Staff, in con­sonance with the 
enforcement of Republic Act 5487 (The Private Agency Law) as amended by 
Presidential Decree No. 11 dated October 3, 1972, it is hereby directed 
that the Customs Metropolitan Police Service (CMPS) take over the 
functions of the Arrastre Security Association (ASA) inasmuch as this 
association is not exempted from the restrictive provisions of said RA 
5487, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 11. </p>
  <p> "As any further operations by the Arrastre Security Association 
within the Customs jurisdictional zone are construed to be contrary to 
the aforecited Presidential Decree, you are hereby directed to assume <em>full command and immediate</em> take-over of the functions of the members of the Arrastre Security Association until further orders from this Office."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the respondent Commission and Secretary of Labor ordered E. Razon and
 Guacods to reinstate the security guards, the private respondents would
 have 350 security guards on their payrolls with nothing to do because 
they were barred from working in the customs zone where they used to 
work.
</p><p>
As stated by the public respondents in their memorandum:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Even if the Commission and the Secretary of Labor ordered the 
reinstatement of all the security guards, if the Bureau of Customs 
refused to allow them to work in the customs zone, the order would be 
futile.  It is not because the Commission and the Secretary of Labor 
have no authority over the Bureau of Customs.  It is because they have 
not acquired jurisdiction over the Bureau of Customs or Deputy 
Commissioner Mendoza who were not made parties in the unfair labor 
practice proceeding.  And even if the Bureau of Customs and Deputy 
Commissioner Mendoza were made parties, still the Commission and the 
Secretary of Labor would have no jurisdiction over them as the security 
guards have no employer-employee relationship with them. </p>
  <p> "If the Commission and the Secretary of Labor went out of their 
way to strike a happy compromise between the security guards on the one 
hand and Guacods and E. Razon on the other hand, by using their moral 
suasion (sic) on the Bureau of Customs to allow selected security guards
 to be reemployed by Guacods and E. Razon and work in the customs zone, 
they deserve to be thanked rather than be charged with grave abuse of 
discretion.  The Commission and the Secretary of Labor could have simply
 ruled that Guacods and E. Razon did not commit unfair labor practice in
 terminating the employment of the security guards because they were 
forced by a martial law measure, i.e., the memorandum of Deputy 
Commissioner Mendoza barring the security guards from the customs zone 
and transferring their functions to the Customs Police.  But they did 
not.  Having in mind the welfare of the Security guards, they endeavored
 to save some of them from the difficult plight of the unemployed. </p>
  <p> "The decision of Deputy Commissioner Mendoza to bar the security 
guards from customs zone is of course not subject to question in this 
proceeding.  The labor arbiter, the National Labor Relations Commission 
and the Secretary of Labor have jurisdiction only over cases arising 
from employer-employee relations.  The barring of the security guards 
from the customs zone is not a matter involving employer-employee 
relations.  As aforesaid, the Bureau of Customs is not the employer of 
the security guards. </p>
  <p> "But even if it is subject to question in the unfair labor case 
proceeding, its wisdom must have to be upheld.  The decision was not 
arrived at the spur of the moment.  It was arrived at after mature 
deliberations involving no less than the Secretary of National Defense. 
 It was precipitated by the long-observed existence of extensive 
pilferages, graft and corruption in the customs zone trace­able partly 
to activities of the security guards.  When martial law presented the 
opportunity to correct this pervasive anomaly, the Bureau of Customs 
grabbed it by barring the security guards from the customs zone and 
transferring their functions to the Customs Police. </p>
  <p> "Since the termination of the employment of the security guards 
was caused by a measure to protect the national interest and to improve 
public service – not the union activities of the security guards — it 
can not be unfair labor practice.  Dismissal of an employee, to be 
unfair labor practice, must be in derogation of his right to 
self-organization or interference with his union activities.  (Sterling 
Products International, Inc. v. Sol, 7 SCRA 446)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As early as February 13, 1973, the respondent Deputy Commissioner made 
it clear in a letter addressed to the counsel of E. Razon that the order
 of take over by the customs police was in full force and effect 
notwithstanding any NLRC decision in the reinstatement with backwages 
case.  He stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Anent your letter of the 12th instant, please be informed that 
the Order/Memorandum dated October 13, 1972 stands, and the same shall 
continue to be in full force and effect, the Decision of the National 
Labor Relations Commission in NLRC Case No. 0320 entitled ‘Arrastre 
Security Association­-Tupas, Complainants, versus E. Razon, Inc., et 
al., Respondents' notwithstanding, until and unless otherwise finally 
ordered by a court/tribunal of competent jurisdiction.  We are 
constrained to take this stand in view of the provisions of Presidential
 Decree No. 11 and related decrees."
  </p>
  <p>
  Considering all of the foregoing, the respondent companies could not 
be declared to have been guilty of unfair labor practice through locking
 out the petitioners, in violation of their collective bargaining 
agreement.  Hence, the respondent-corporations could not be ordered to 
reinstate much less pay backwages.  As the Secretary of Labor stated:
  </p>

  <p> "We affirm the Commission's judgment that the members of the 
complainant Union may not recover back wages during their temporary 
lay-off.  This lay off was clearly brought about by sudden changes 
introduced under the Martial Law by authorities of the government within 
the Customs jurisdictional zone by virtue of which respondents were 
virtually deprived of control and management over their area of 
operation.  Thus, under these emergency conditions, no unfair labor 
practice charges could be levelled against respondents for failure of 
the unionists to work.  Given their choices, respondents would have in 
all probability allowed members of the complainant Union to continue 
with their work, considering their existing collective bargaining 
agreement.  But, during this interregnum, respondents were left no 
choice at all but to submit to the overriding requirements of the public
 interest and national security.  Certainly, requiring respondents to 
assume the additional burden of paying backwages to complainant 
unionists during this period, the cause of which was not attributable to
 them, would indeed be unfair and unjust."

The Secretary of Labor ordered the private respon­dents to extend 
financial assistance equivalent to one month salary to each laid off 
worker.  Under the circumstances and equities of this case, it is more 
appropriate to consider the termination of employment as part of a 
reduction in force occasioned by the cessation of operations in the 
customs premises.  The petitioners are, therefore, entitled to 
separation pay according to the provisions of their collective 
bargaining agreement and, if there is none, according to the pertinent 
pro­visions of the Labor Code and applicable rules and regulations.
</p><p>
We see no need to pass upon the alleged unconstitutionality of Article 
244 of Presidential Decree No. 442 as amended and Section 11, Rule Two, 
Book V of the Rules and Regulations implementing the Labor Code.  This 
petition may be resolved without touching upon the constitutional issue.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition calling for the nullifica­tion and setting aside
 of the questioned decision and resolution is dismissed for lack of 
merit.  The resolution of the respondent Secretary of Labor is modified 
to entitle the three hundred fifty (350) security guards-petitioners to 
separation pay according to the terms of their collective bargaining 
agreement or the pertinent provisions of the Labor Code and implementing
 rules and regulations but in no event to be less than the one month 
salary ordered by the respondent Secretary.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
