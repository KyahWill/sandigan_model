				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>petition
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for </span>review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking
to set aside the Order dated May 17, 1976 of the then City Court of Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span> City, dismissing the information in Criminal Case
No. 6398 for violation of P.D. No. 772 (penalizing squatting and similar acts),
as well as the Order dated May 31, 1976, denying petitioner's motion for
reconsi­deration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents were charged in the court <u>a quo</u>, <span class="GramE">then</span> presided over by respondent Judge with violation of
P.D. No. 772 which penalizes squatting in an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">information </span>which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"That on or about the 2nd week of October,
1975 and for sometime subsequent thereto, at Bo.</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagongbayan</span>,
Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span> City, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, conspiring and
confederating together and mutually helping one another and taking advantage of
the absence and/or tolerance of the landowner, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously occupy and build a
house on the land owned by Felix <span class="SpellE">Yara</span> for residential
and/or commercial purpose and refuses (sic) to vacate said land despite
repeated demands to vacate made by Felix <span class="SpellE">Yara</span>, which
act is a violation of Presidential Decree No. 772." <span class="GramE">(Annex
'A' to the Petition for Review, p. 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 6398 of the court <u>a
quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a motion to quash filed by private respondents, alleging
that the facts charged do not constitute an offense, respondent Judge dismissed
the case in an Order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="17" month="5">May 17,
 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In dismissing the
information, respondent Judge opined:</p>

<blockquote>"From the purpose clause of Presidential Decree No. 772 it is
very evident that what is penalized are acts of squatting only in urban
communities and not just any community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence therefore of a recital in the information that Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bagongbayan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename>Puerto</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Princesa</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where the squatting was allegedly committed is an urban community, the court is
of the opinion and so holds that the facts charged do not constitute an
offense.” <span class="GramE">(Annex 'F' to Petition for Review, p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution moved for reconsideration of the said Order, but
was denied in the Order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="5">May 31,
 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is premised on the sole assignment of error, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>wit:</p>

<blockquote>"THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 772 <span class="GramE">PENALIZES</span>
SQUATTING IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMU­NITIES."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 P.D. 772 provides, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any person who, with the use of force,
intimidation or threat, or taking advantage of the absence or tolerance of the
landowner, succeeds in occupying or possessing the property of the latter
against his will for residential, commercial or any other purposes, shall be
punished by an imprisonment ranging from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">six </span>months to one year or a fine of not less
than that one thousand nor more than five thousand pesos at the discretion of
the court, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency." (2nd
paragraph is omitted).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question as to which community or communities P.D. 772
applies has long been resolved by this Court in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Echaves</span>,
95 SCRA 663 (1980) where it was held:</p>

<blockquote>"We hold that the lower court correctly ruled that the decree
does not apply to pasture lands because its preamble shows <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>it was intended to apply to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">squatting </span>in urban communities or more
particularly to illegal constructions in squatter areas made by well-to-do
individuals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The squatting complained of
involves pasture lands in rural areas."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid ruling was restated in Bernardo vs. People, 123
SCRA 365 (1983) as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The intent of the decree (referring to P.D. No. 772) is
unmistakable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is intended to apply
only to urban communities, particularly to illegal constructions." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The unmistakable intent of P.D. No. 772 may be gleaned from its
preamble, thus:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, it came to my knowledge that despite the issuance of
Letter of Instruction No. 19 dated October 2, 1972, directing the Secretaries
of National Defense, Public Works <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
Communications, Social Welfare and the Director of Public Works, the PHHC
General Manager, the Presidential Assistant on Housing and Rehabilitation
Agency, Governors, City and Municipal Mayors, and City and District Engineers,

banks, those along railroad tracks and those built without permits on public
and private property, ‘squatting</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">

communities</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">all over the country;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, many persons or entities found to have been
unlawfully occupying public and private lands belong to <u>the affluent class</u>;<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"WHEREAS, there is a need to further
intensify the government's drive against this illegal and nefarious
practice."</span> (Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Considering that PD 772
applies only to urban communi­ties and the information filed in the case at bar
does not allege that barrio <span class="SpellE">Bagongbayan</span>, Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span> City where the squatting was allegedly committed
is an urban community, the respondent Judge did not commit any reversible error
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">holding that the facts charged do not
constitute an offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
