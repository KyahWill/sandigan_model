meters away (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., September 22, 1983, pp. 26; 80).</p>

<p class="BODY">We find nothing incredible in Dolores’ foregoing actuations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, for a child of her age, she
showed good judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be
recalled that, aside from her grandmother, her only companions in the house
were her first cousins, two boys who were younger than she, and who were both
fast asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To have gone out of the
house immediately by herself in the darkness of night would have been risky on
her part besides the fact that she was "afraid".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She judiciously waited till early dawn,
although it was really still dark that she had to light the lamp in their <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, woke her cousins up, and together they <span class="GramE">proceeded</span> to their aunt's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although a neighbor did live nearer their
place, there was no assurance that the same assistance and concern as that of a
blood relative would be extended to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That she took no positive action immediately after the incident but went
back to sleep is neither strange for, as testified to by her, she could neither
move nor shout because of fear (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1983</st1:date>, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">88).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>She
had sensed that with all the stabbings her grandmother had received, she was
already dead.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
did not bother to find out in the room of your <span class="SpellE">Nanay</span>
Cristina what happened to her but you just went back to sleep?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
just went back to sleep as I could not move and I could not shout because of
fear" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="9">Sept. 22, 1983</st1:date>, p. 121)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Berbal</span> further claims that
Dolores involved herself in serious contradictions when she declared three
times that she was awakened by the kicking of the door by <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., September 22, 1983, pp. 55, 64 &amp; 79);
while twice, she also stated that it was the moaning of Cristina that awakened
her (ibid., pp. 9 &amp; 10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it
is argued, if it was her grandmother's moaning that awakened her, Dolores could
not have seen the stabbing because the latter preceded the former in point of
time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contradiction is more apparent than real.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dolores woke up when the door was kicked open
by <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Berbal</span> but did
not bother to stand up because she had already seen a person.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
did not bother to stand up and find out what was his purpose in kicking your
door?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did
not stand up because I saw already a person" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="9">Sept. 22, 1983</st1:date>, p. 56).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When that happened, she pretended to be asleep.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And,
you were awakened when that door was opened because you <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">were </span>just near the door?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes
(witness demonstrated by closing her eyes pretending that she was slept
(sic)." <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(ibid. </span>p.55)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, when <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Berbal</span> kicked the door open, she was already awakened but
pretended to be asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She then saw <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Berbal</span> enter her
grandmother's room and heard him instruct <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanite</span> to light a match after which she saw <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> stab her grandmother and heard her moan and kick
her feet on the mat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dolores was,
therefore, awakened when the door was kicked open and remained awake since then
and throughout the stabbing although she pretended to be asleep.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">when your <span class="SpellE">Nanay</span> Cristina </span>was moaning you were already awakened
earlier because of the kicking of the door by <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Berbal</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, <span class="GramE">your</span> Honor, as

<p class="BODY">The crucial point is that Dolores witnessed the stabbing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had a direct view as she was lying down
opposite the door of her grandmother's bedroom - (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1983</st1:date>, p. 85),
which was open and had neither shutter nor curtain (ibid., p. 47).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The truthfulness of her testimony can also be
gauged by the fact that she accurately stated that her grandmother was lying on
her side, crosswise on her mat on the floor, when she was stabbed several times
by <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was confirmed by the testimony of the public health nurse who
conducted an examination on the body of the deceased and found multiple stab
wounds at her back (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., March 8, 1984, pp. 7-9),
by the photographs depicting the stab wounds on her back (Exhibits
"C", "C-3", "C-4" and "C-5"), and by
the death certificate (Exhibit "B") of Cristina <span class="SpellE">Basul</span>
stating that she died of shock secondary to severe internal hemorrhage due to
multiple stab (25) wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The veracity of her testimony is further shown by her statement
that the door of their house was unlocked, which was confirmed in the Affidavit
of accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanite</span>
executed on <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="1">22 January 1983</st1:date>
(p. 10, Original Record).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That she was
not prone to exaggerate <span class="GramE">either,</span> is shown by her
declaration that she could not demonstrate the length of the bolo used by <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> as "they (<span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>) had put off the light." (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="9">September
 22, 1983</st1:date>, p. 22)</p>

<p class="BODY">Her identification of accused-appellants is likewise very
credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Berbal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanite</span> were no strangers to her (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1983</st1:date>, p. 14).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>, being a
relative of her grandmother (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1985</st1:date>, p. 14) used to visit
the latter at her house (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1983</st1:date>, p. 115).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when questioned if <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> was her friend, she replied in the affirmative
(ibid., p. 118).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That
the lighted match, therefore, illumined only a small area will not affect her
recognition of <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>
since she knew them well.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There being nothing in her testimony nor from the records to
indicate that Dolores was actuated by improper motives, <span class="GramE">her
declarations are</span> entitled to full faith and credit (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Boholst</span>, L-73008, July 23, 1987, 152 SCRA 263).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither can we believe, as claimed by the
defense, that Dolores was just a coached witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would have been difficult for a child of
such tender years to have been merely taught to give all the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">details that she had narrated and to have
withstood a long and grueling cross examination if she had not, in fact,
witnessed the brutal incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appellant's defense of
alibi cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">prevail over </span>the </span>positive
identification made of him by prosecution witness, Dolores <span class="SpellE">Basul</span>,
aside from the fact that he failed to prove that it was physically impossible
for him to have returned from his fishing trip and to have been at the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the crime at the time it was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, disproving <span class="SpellE">Anacleto's</span> claim
that he was out fishing, and could not have been at San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>,
the scene of the crime, was the testimony of prosecution witness, Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Tandayag</span>, who declared that at around 11:00 o'clock P.M. on
28 December 1982, <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Berbal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanite</span> rode
on his <span class="SpellE">banca</span> from San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
to go to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabang</span> where
he intended to buy petroleum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, they were at San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> where the crime took
place that evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding that
<span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Berbal</span> was <span class="SpellE">Tandayag's</span> brother-in-law and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Juanite's</span> father was <span class="SpellE">Tandayag's</span>
"<span class="SpellE">compadre</span>", <span class="SpellE">Tandayag</span>
still testified the way he did.</p>

<p class="BODY">We come now to the modifying circumstances accompanying the
commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aggravating
circumstance of nighttime was correctly appreciated by the Trial Court,
contrary to the second assignment of error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is self-evident that it was sought by appellant to facilitate the
commission of the offense, when all the members of the household were
asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanite</span> lit a
matchstick does not negate the presence of said aggravating circumstance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in People vs. Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, et al. (L-32244, June 24, 1983, 122 SCRA 740),
this Court rejected the contention that <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> could
not be appreciated because flashlights were used.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the defense, however, when it claims in its third
assigned error, that the aggravating circumstance of disregard of the respect
due the victim on account of her age, 58 years old at the time of the
commission of the crime, is not present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution failed to show that the accused had deliberately
intended to offend or insult her age (People vs. Diaz, L-24002, January 21,
1974, 55 SCRA 178).</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can we appreciate the aggravating circumstance of disregard
of the respect due the victim on account of her sex.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has not been shown that Appellant had
particularly intended to cast insult or commit disrespect to the sex of the
victim (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Brana</span>, L-29210, October 31, 1969,
30 SCRA 307).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In one case where <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">lesiones</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>were inflicted by the defendant on
his prospective mother-in-law, abuse of superiority was considered aggravating
but not disregard of sex (United States vs. Juan Escobar, 1 Phil. 200, cited in
the Revised Penal Code, Book I, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, p. 290).</p>

<p class="BODY">Abuse of superior strength which was alleged in the Information,
must, indeed, be appreciated in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Juanite</span> purposely used excessive force out of
proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 58-year old victim herein was attacked
while she was asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although only one
of them was armed, the presence of the other served to ensure the accomplishment
of their felonious act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An attack made
by a man with a deadly weapon upon an unarmed and defenseless woman constitutes
the circumstance of abuse of that superiority which his sex and the weapon used
in the act afforded him, and by means of which the woman was overcome and
rendered unable to defend herself, and perhaps not even able to escape from the
savage attack of her aggressor (U.S. vs. Consuelo, 13 Phil. 612 (1909); People
vs. Quesada, 62 Phil. 446 (1935).</p>

<p class="BODY">With the qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength,
and the aggravating circumstances of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and
dwelling, without any mitigating circumstances, the supreme penalty is, indeed,
imposable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, considering the
provisions of Article III, Section 19, paragraph (1) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
