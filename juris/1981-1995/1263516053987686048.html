He had been a policeman for almost twenty (20) years.&nbsp; Admittedly, before the incident, bad blood existed between him and the victim. Accused-appellant and his brother-in-law, Carlo Uycoque, reside inside the Department of Public Works and Highways Compound in Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila.<br><br>The victim, Lucas Flores, was a former member of the Philippine Marines, Armed Forces of the Philippines. After his separation from the service, he worked as a security guard.&nbsp; At the time of his death, he was a <i>barangay tanod </i>at <i>Barangay</i> No. 905, Zone III, Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila.<br><br>On May 2, 1991, at around 9:30 P.M., Lucas and his wife, Francisca Flores, were resting in their house situated inside the DPWH Compound, in Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila. They heard someone knocking at the door.&nbsp; Lucas stood up and opened the door.&nbsp; Suddenly, someone grabbed Lucas, poked a gun at him, and forced him out of the house.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter, Francisca heard two (2) successive gunshots, followed by another volley of gunshots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Francisca rushed to her husband's succor.&nbsp; However, she was too late.&nbsp; She found him lying prostrate on the ground.&nbsp; He had been shot.&nbsp; According to Francisca, she saw accused-appellant Jose Villanueva and two (2) other suspects surrounding her fallen husband.&nbsp; The three (3) men were armed with guns.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Instinctively, Francisca embraced Lucas.&nbsp; Irked, accused-appellant shoved her aside and in the process Lucas was released from her hold.&nbsp; Accused-appellant then poked his gun at her and threatened: <i>"Kung gusto mo, ikaw ang isusunod ko!"</i> Francisca quipped: <i>"Iputok mo!"</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thereafter, she sought help from her neighbors.&nbsp; Accused-appellant and his cohorts fled.<br><br>When Francisca returned to the scene of the crime, she saw her friend, Veronica Venezuela.&nbsp; Veronica embraced her.&nbsp; With the help of some neighbors, Lucas was taken to the Trinity General Hospital. He did not survive the gunshots.<br><br>At about 11:15 P.M., that same evening, Lucas' body was autopsied by Dr. Manuel Lagonera, Medico-Legal Officer of the Western Police District Command (WPDC).&nbsp; The Post-Mortem Findings<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> revealed that Lucas was shot at least <b><i>seven </i>(7) <i>times</i></b> on the different parts of his body, thus:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"POST MORTEM FINDINGS<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">"EXTERNAL INJURIES WITH EXTENSION INTERNALLY:<br></div><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">"1. </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Gunshot wound, with the point of entry at the left lateral side of the nose, 59 1/4 inches from heel, 2.5 cms. from anterior midline, measuring 0.4 x 0.3 cm. and contusion collar measures 1 x 0.6 cms. </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">"Course: <b><i>Directed obliquely downward</i></b>, slightly backward, crossing the midline towards the right lateral (from left to right), lacerating muscles and sub-cutaneous tissues, and fracturing the nasal bone, right maxillary bone, alveolar process and body of right mandible. <b><i>The slug lodged in the musculo-cutaneous layer of the right lateral side of the neck where it was extracted</i></b>.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">2.</div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">" Gun shot wound, thru and thru, with the following points of entry and exit:</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">"Point of entry- left cheek, oval in shape, 57 1/4 from heel, 6.3 cms. from anterior midline, measuring 0.3 x 0.4 cm. and contusion collar measures 0.8 x 0.7 cm. and</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">"Point of exit- at the left anterior neck, irregular in shape, with rugged and everted edges, 55 inches from heel, 3 cms. from anterior midline measuring 3 x 1.8 cms.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">"Course: <b><i>Directed obliquely downward</i></b>, forward towards midline, lacerating muscles and sub-­cutaneous tissues fracturing left maxillary bone, alveolar process and body of left mandible.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"3.</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Gunshot wound, thru and thru, with the following points of entry and exit.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">"Point of entry- Just below the left zygomatic bone, elongated in shape, 57 1/2 inches from heel, 10 cms. from anterior midline measuring 2.5 x 0.5 cms., widest at the angle of approach, and contusion collar measures 2.8 x 0.8 cms. and</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">"Point of exit- left anterior neck, irregular in shape with rugged and everted edges, 55 inches from heel, 3 cms. from anterior midline measuring 3 x 1.8 cms.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"4. </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Gunshot wound, with the point of entry at the left anterior thorax, along anterior axillary line, oval in shape, 49 inches from heel, 18.7 cms. from anterior midline measuring 0.6 x 0.5 cm. and contusion collar measures 1.2 x 1.2 cms.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">"Course: <b><i>Directed obliquely downward</i></b>, backward towards midline, fracturing the left 6th rib, lacerating upper lobe, left lung (thru and thru), then lower lobe, left lung (thru and thru).

These slugs were later submitted to the Ballistic Section of the WPD for examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>The evidence reveal that, shortly after the incident, accused-appellant surrendered to the authorities at Police Station No. 6.&nbsp; Later in the evening, he was turned over to the Homicide Section of the Western Police District (WPD), in United Nations Avenue, Manila, where he was further investigated.<br><br>During the investigation, Francisca Flores positively identified accused-appellant as one of her husband's assailants.&nbsp; She was, however, unable to name his cohorts, although she averred she had recognized their faces.&nbsp; Thereafter, at about 11:30 P.M., she executed her sworn statement before investigating officer Pat. Rosendo Delos Santos of the WPD-Homicide Section.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The following day, at about 6:00 P.M., Francisca gave additional statement to Pat. Delos Santos and claimed that her husband's two (2) other assailants were Ulysis Garcia and Carlo Uycoque.&nbsp; Carlo is the brother-in-law of accused-appellant, while Ulysis is the brother of her friend Veronica Venezuela.<br><br>Accused-appellant claimed sole responsibility for shooting the victim.&nbsp; He, however, claimed he shot the victim in self-defense.<br><br>Allegedly, on the material date and time, accused-appellant dropped by Amado Hael's house, also situated inside the DPWH Compound in Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila.&nbsp; He was to ask Amado Hael, a carpenter, how much it would cost to repair his house.&nbsp; At that time, accused-appellant was in civilian clothes.&nbsp; He also had his service gun with him and six (6) live bullets which were given to him by Captain Reynaldo Jaylo.<br><br>While accused-appellant and Amado Hael were conversing infront of Amado's house, they heard a gunshot. Accused-appellant turned and saw a man standing across the street about ten (10) meters away from them. Accused-appellant could hardly recognize the man who was then carrying a gun.&nbsp; Accused-appellant thus headed towards the gunman.<br><br>The gunman fired at accused-appellant but failed to hit the latter.&nbsp; Thereafter, the gunman fled towards an alley while accused-appellant pursued him.&nbsp; After a brief chase, their paths crossed.&nbsp; To accused-appellant's surprise, the assailant turned out to be Lucas Flores, the Chief of <i>Barangay Tanod</i> and an alleged henchman of Barangay Chairman Manuel Venezuela.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellant went closer to Lucas.&nbsp; He was about four (4) or five (5) meters away from Lucas when the latter pulled a hand grenade from his pocket using his left hand.&nbsp; Lucas warned:&nbsp; "This is a grenade, don't go near me." Thereafter, Lucas placed his right forefinger into the grenade's pin.&nbsp; Sensing that Lucas was going to pull the pin, accused-appellant shot him twice.&nbsp; Unsure if he had hit Lucas, accused-appellant moved about two (2) meters more towards Lucas.&nbsp; For the second time, Lucas attempted to pull the grenade's pin.&nbsp; Again, accused-appellant shot Lucas twice.&nbsp; Lucas slumped on the ground, face up.&nbsp; Accused-appellant then took Lucas's gun and hand grenade.<br><br>In the meantime, Francisca Flores arrived at the scene. She shouted caustic remarks against accused-appellant.&nbsp; He then offered to bring Lucas to a hospital, but Francisca insisted on taking Lucas to the hospital by herself.&nbsp; She shouted for help.&nbsp; Accused-appellant then left the scene and surrendered to the authorities at Police Station No. 6.&nbsp; Later in the evening, he was brought to the Homicide Section of the WPD in United Nations Avenue.<br><br>Upon his surrender, he turned over his service firearm, a <b>.<i>38 caliber revolver Smith &amp; Wesson, bearing Serial Number AUF2177</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> with four (4) spent shells, to the investigating officers.&nbsp; He also submitted the weapons he allegedly retrieved from Lucas after the shooting incident, <i>viz</i>:&nbsp; a .38 caliber revolver Smith &amp; Wesson (<i>Paltik</i>), bearing Serial Number 307739, two spent shells, and one (1) M-67 live hand grenade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>To bolster his contention that he shot Lucas in self-defense, accused-appellant presented defense witnesses Amado Hael, Mario Macato Castillo and Captain Reynaldo Jaylo.<br><br>Amado Hael and Mario Castillo claimed they witnessed the shooting incident.&nbsp; They testified in substance that Lucas was the one who first fired at accused-appellant but missed, prompting the latter to fire back at Lucas.<br><br>According to AMADO HAEL, he was talking to accused-appellant when they heard a gunshot coming from the other side of the road.&nbsp; Accused-appellant then ran across the street to check where the gunshot came from. Amado Hael followed accused-appellant who proceed towards an alley leading to the house of Lucas. Accused-appellant accosted Lucas in the middle of the alley near the latter's house and confronted the latter if he was the one who fired the gun.&nbsp; At that time, accused-appellant had his gun drawn.&nbsp; Suddenly, Lucas drew his gun and fired at accused-appellant. Accused-appellant retaliated by firing back at Lucas twice.&nbsp; Two seconds later, two more shots were fired by accused-­appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Lucas then fell on the ground, face up. Thereafter, accused-appellant took the grenade and the gun from Lucas.<br><br>When Francisca arrived at the scene, she screamed: "<i>Putang-ina mo, Joe.&nbsp; Bakit mo binaril ang asawa ko?</i>" He replied:&nbsp; "<i>Binaril ako ng asawa mo.</i>" Accused-appellant later offered to bring Lucas to a hospital.&nbsp; Francisca retorted:&nbsp; "<i>Ako na ang bahala sa asawa ko</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>MARIO MACATO CASTILLO testified that, on May 2, 1992, at about 9:00 P.M., he was inside the DPWH Compound to visit a relative. Allegedly, he saw four (4) armed men running towards the house of Lucas Flores.&nbsp; Thereafter, Lucas and accused-appellant's paths crossed.&nbsp; At a distance of about ten (10) meters, Mario saw Lucas and accused-appellant arguing.&nbsp; At that time, Lucas was holding a grenade with his left hand. Thereafter, Lucas pulled out a .38 cal. handgun and fired at accused-appellant twice.&nbsp; In turn, accused-appellant fired back at Lucas once. At that instance, Mario ran for his safety.&nbsp; While fleeing, Mario heard two (2) more shots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>CAPTAIN REYNALDO JAYLO corroborated the testimony of accused-appellant that he gave the latter six (6) pieces of bullets, a special type of bullet known in the United States as SABOT bullet.&nbsp; Captain Jaylo explained that when fired, a "double slug bullet" separates into two slugs, while a "triple slug bullet" separates into three slugs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The innuendo of the defense was that, using these special bullets, the victim could sustain more than four (4) gunshot wounds although accused-appellant shot him four times.<br><br>After trial on the merits, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment, convicting Jose Villanueva, Jr., of the crime charged.&nbsp; His co-accused, Carlo Uycoque, was acquitted by the trial court for the prosecution's failure to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the trial court decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> provides:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the Accused Jose Villanueva guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of "Murder" defined and penalized by Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, qualified by treachery, and hereby metes on him the penalty of "RECLUSION PERPETUA" with all the accessory penalties of the law and condemns him to pay to the heirs of Lucas Flores P50,000.00 by way of indemnity; P20,000.00 as moral damages, and P40,000.00 as actual damages. The period during which the accused was detained at the City Jail of Manila shall be credited to the said accused in full provided that he agreed in writing to abide by and comply strictly with the rules and regulations of the City Jail of Manila.&nbsp; With costs against said accused.<br><br>"The accused Carlo Uycoque is hereby acquitted of the said charge for failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the (said) (a)ccused beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The (a)ccused Carlo Uycoque is not also liable for damages to the heirs of Lucas Flores for the latter's demise.&nbsp; The Warden of the City Jail of Manila is hereby ordered to release the accused Carlo Uycogue from detention unless he is being detained for another cause or charge.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote><br>Hence, the appeal.&nbsp; Accused-appellant contends:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE KILLING OF VICTIM LUCAS FLORES WAS QUALIFIED BY TREACHERY.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE ACCUSED' VERSION THAT HE SHOT THE VICTIM, LUCAS FLORES, IN SELF-DEFENSE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF DWELLING ATTENDED THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN SENTENCING THE ACCUSED THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA AND (sic) NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRESENCE OF MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF VOLUNTARY SURRENDER.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">V<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ORDERING ACCUSED TO PAY P40,000.00 AS ACTUAL DAMAGES.</blockquote><br>We affirm the judgment of conviction.<br><br>The guilt of the accused-appellant hinges on the proper calibration of the credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution <i>vis-a-vis</i> the witnesses for the defense.<br><br>The essence of the testimony of Francisca is that, while she and her husband, Lucas, were resting in their house, Lucas was forcibly taken and then immediately shot by the malefactors, led by accused-appellant. The trial court gave her testimony full faith and credit and we have no cogent reason not to concur.&nbsp; It is settled that when the issue boils down to the credibility of witnesses, the findings of the trial court deserve great respect since it is in a better position to observe the demeanor of the witnesses while testifying in court and discern its dimensions, verbal and non-verbal. Her relationship with the victim did not necessarily diminish her credibility as a witness.&nbsp; On the contrary, it lent more credence to her testimony as her natural interest is to see the guilty punished.<br><br>Over and above the testimony of Francisca, the physical evidence on record repudiate accused-appellant's claim of self-defense.&nbsp; Physical evidence are mute but eloquent manifestations of truth and they rate high in our hierarchy of trustworthy evidence.<br><br>In his Incident Report, dated May 2, 1991,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> accused-appellant claimed he shot Lucas Flores four (4) times.&nbsp; To justify the seven (7) gunshot wounds inflicted on the victim, accused-appellant collaborated with Captain Reynaldo Jaylo and attempted to establish that the special bullets, particularly, triple slug bullets, were used during the shooting incident.&nbsp; The attempt cannot succeed.<br><br>The ballistic examination<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> conducted on the four (4) slugs extracted from the body of the victim reveals the following:<br><br><blockquote>"FINDINGS/CONCLUSION:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

According to Ballistician Emmanuel Aragones, the two (2) slugs in Exhibit "J-2" had riflings twisting to the <b><i>left</i></b>, while the other two (2) slugs, (Exhibit "J-3") had riflings twisting to the <b><i>right</i></b>, a class characteristic of a Smith &amp;

head, specifically, below the left cheekbone, the left side of the nose just below the left eye, and the left cheek) and gunshot wound No. 4 (point of entry:&nbsp; the left portion of the breast).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On the other hand, gunshot wound nos. 5 to 7 (points of entry:&nbsp;

In fact, accused-appellant had to proceed to the place where the gunshot came from, precisely to look for the person who was responsible therefor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Amado Hael also testified that Lucas' left hand was still inside his pocket when accused-appellant shot him for the first time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>Defense witness Mario Castillo, for his part, declared that, during the alleged confrontation, Lucas was already holding the hand grenade. Thereafter, Lucas drew his gun and fired at accused-appellant twice.&nbsp; On cross?examination, Mario further averred that he immediately left the scene after Lucas had fired at accused-appellant twice.&nbsp; On further cross-examination, he changed his answer and said that Lucas fired at accused-appellant only once.&nbsp; Mario then hurriedly left the scene.&nbsp; While fleeing, he heard two (2) more shots.&nbsp; He was not certain who fired the two (2) gunshots.&nbsp; On further questioning by the court, he claimed he saw accused-appellant fired two shots.&nbsp; While he (Mario) was leaving, he heard two more shots.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>We agree with the trial court that the killing was committed with treachery which qualified the crime to Murder.&nbsp; There is <i>alevosia</i> since the attack was sudden and unexpected, rendering the victim defenseless in the hands of his assailants and ensuring the accomplishment of the assailants' evil purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> We quote with approval the findings of the trial court, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"The Court is convinced that, as testified to by Francisca Flores, the (a)ccused, Jose Villanueva, and his cohorts killed Lucas Flores with treachery.&nbsp; The (a)ccused Jose Villanueva and his cohorts pretended to be visitors, knocked on the door to the house of Lucas Flores and, when the latter went to open the door, the (a)ccused and his cohorts then pulled Lucas Flores out of the door and shot him to death.&nbsp; Lucas Flores sustained no less than seven (7) gunshot wounds.&nbsp; The incident was so sudden and unexpected. Lucas Flores was not thus able to defend himself and (sic) against the unforeseen assault on him."</blockquote><br>The aggravating circumstance of dwelling also attended the commission of the crime even if the victim was killed outside his residence. A person's abode is regarded as a sanctuary which should be respected by everybody.&nbsp; Here, while the victim was resting in the comfort of his home, accused-appellant and his cohort(s) forcibly led him (the victim) out of his house shortly before he was shot to death.&nbsp; At that point, the aggression had begun, although it ended outside the victim's house.<br><br>An act performed cannot be divided or its unity be broken up, when the offender began the aggression in the dwelling of the offended party and ended it in the street or outside said dwelling.&nbsp; Dwelling is aggravating if the victim was taken from his house and killed just beside his abode although the offense was not completed therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The penalty prescribed for Murder is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> The generic aggravating circumstance of dwelling was offset by the generic mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.&nbsp; Thus, as correctly ruled by the trial court, the penalty should be imposed in its medium period, that is, <b><i>reclusion perpetua</i></b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br>Parenthetically, section 21 of R.A.
