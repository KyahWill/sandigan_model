  of Branch 7 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Legazpi City in 
Criminal Case No. 2144 entitled "People of the Philippines vs. Abelardo 
Penillos, et al.", promulgated on 28 September 1983, convicting the 
accused-appellant of the crime of Robbery with Homicide and Attempted 
Homicide pursuant to Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code and 
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of "reclusion perpetua or life 
imprisonment."
<p>
The information prepared by the then assistant city fiscal charges the 
above-named accused with the crime of "Robbery with Homicide and 
Attempted Homicide" committed as follows:
</p><blockquote>

  </p>
  <p> "That on or about the 31st day of July, 1981, in the City of
 
Legazpi, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and helping 
one another for a common purpose, with intent of gain (sic) and by means
 of violence against or intimidation, did then and there wilfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously enter the house of the spouses APRONIANO 
LLADONES and EPIFANIA LOPEZ LLADONES and once inside, forcibly take the 
amount of P1,000.00 from the said spouses and by reason of or on 
occasion of the robbery and with intent to kill, attacked, assaulted, 
hogtied and stabbed APRONIANO LLADONES inflicting injuries upon the 
latter which directly caused his untimely death; while EPIFANIA LOPEZ 
LLADONES was hacked on her shoulder, thus accused commenced the 
commission of the crime directly by overt acts but did not perform all 
the acts of execution which could produce the crime of Homicide upon 
said EPIFANIA LOPEZ LLADONES by reason of causes other than their 
spontaneous desistance."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>

  <p>
    Only accused-appellant Abelardo Penillos was apprehended. The others
 remain at large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Accused-appellant entered a plea of not guilty upon arraignment and 
was given a separate trial.
  </p>
  <p>
    The court <em>a quo</em> summarized the evidence for the
 prosecution, upon which it based its conviction of appellant, as 
follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    x x x
  </p>
  <p> “Four defendants are charged with the offense of ‘Robbery 
with 
Homicide and Attempted Homicide.’ Among them, only one was apprehended 
and a separate trial was held. On June 18, 1982, defendant Abelardo 
Penillos pleaded ‘Not Guilty.’
  </p>
  <p> The following facts are not disputed. On July 31, 1981, in 
the 
early hours of the evening or thereabouts (sic), at Sitio Naontogan, 
Bariis, Legazpi (sic) City, Aproniano Lladones and spouse Epifania Lopez
 were awakened as four (4) persons suddenly entered their house. The 
intruders demanded money from the couple and when Aproniano Lladones 
refused to accede he was carried outside his dwelling by the four 
persons. He was later on found hogtied and lifeless suffering (sic) from
 multiple stab wounds. His wife, Epifania Lladones Lopez was also hacked
 with a bolo by one of the entrants (sic) as she tried to follow to find
 out where her husband was being taken. The following morning Abelardo 
Penillos was apprehended and after giving an extra-judicial confession, 
the present complaint was filed against him and his co-conspirators, 
Mariano Maraño, Romeo Nuyda and Jose Nuyda. The last three defendants 
remained at large hence Abelardo Penillos was afforded a separate trial.
 </p>
  <p>
      Testifying for the prosecution, Epifania Lopez Lladones narrated 
that on the night in question while she and her husband were asleep 
inside their house they were awakened by the entry of four persons who 
demanded money from them; that one of the intruders even sat on the 
belly of her husband who was caught still lying down and at that moment 
she was able to recognize one of them as Abelardo Penillos because of 
the illumination coming from a kerosene lamp in the kitchen adjoining 
the sala; that Abelardo Penillos was one of the four persons who brought
 her husband outside the house and as she tried to follow she was hacked
 by one of them whose identity she cannot tell; that she suffered a hack
 wound and later on she came to know that her husband, hogtied, was 
found dead from stab wounds; that she crawled in the dark to the house 
of her neighbor Celerino Nudo who reported the incident to the barangay 
captain who in turn lost no time in notifying the police authorities; 
that recollecting the robbery she discovered the loss of P1,000.00 kept 
in a bamboo basket and during the time she was confined at the hospital 
she recognized Abelardo Penillos as one of the perpetrators when brought
 to her for confrontation.
  </p>
  <p> Celerino Nudo also testifying recalls that in the evening of
 July 
31, 1981 Epifania Lopez then seriously injured from a hack wound arrived
 at his house to seek his help regarding an incident in their house; 
that she mentioned a certain Billy Penillos as one of the men who 
forcibly entered their dwelling while they were asleep; that he at once 
reported the matter to the barangay captain and rushed Epifania Lladones
 to the hospital."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
      x x x
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon the other hand, appellant relied on alibi as his defense, which is 
summarized by the trial court as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “x x x Penillos testified that on July 31, 1981, he was in 
the 
house of his grandmother at Barangay Esperanza, Putiao, Sorsogon, in the
 morning until six o'clock in the evening; that he left Barangay 
Esperanza thereafter riding on a carabao sledge loaded with coconuts and
 arrived at Barangay Imalnod, Legaspi City, a distance of about 4 
kilometers at past eight o'clock in the evening; that he proceeded to 
the house of his father-in-law where he spent the night because he was 
already tired; that he was able to surmise the time of his arrival 
because he overheard from the radio that the drama serial Zimatar had 
just been concluded.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After trial, the lower court rendered the challenged decision, the 
dispositive portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    x x x
  </p>
  <p> "All the foregoing and EVIDENCE considered, and finding the 
guilt 
of the defendant beyond reasonable doubt, Abelardo ‘Billy’ Penillos @ 
Guillermo Penillos is sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion 
Perpetua or life imprisonment and to indemnify the heirs of Aproniano 
Lladones in the amount of P20,000; further, defendant to pay Epifania 
Lopez Lladones the amount of P1,000.00, cash stolen, in both instances 
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency. </p>
  <p> Credit the defendant the full time of any preventive 
imprisonment in the service of his sentence in accordance with 
law.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>

</blockquote>
<p>
Appellant immediately filed a Notice of Appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  wherein he manifested that he is appealing the decision to the 
Intermediate Appellate Court. In view of the penalty imposed, the appeal
 should have been made to this Court. The records of the case were 
erroneously transmitted to the then Intermediate Appellate Court (now 
Court of Appeals) which properly forwarded the same to this Court on 24 
November 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
 On 20 December 1983, We required the appellant to file his 
Brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  which 
he complied with on 16 July 1984<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  after being granted several extensions. The 
appellee, on the other hand, submitted its Brief on 15 November 
1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
Appellant submits the following assignment of errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I </p>
  <p>
    THAT THE COURT <em>A QUO</em> ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE 
TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF APPELLANT BY THE COMPLAINANT.
  </p>
  <p>
    II
  </p>
  <p> THAT THE COURT <em>A QUO</em> ERRED IN GIVING 
THE STATEMENT OF 
APPELLANT GREAT WEIGHT WHEN SAID STATEMENT WAS TAKEN IN DEROGATION OF 
APPELLANT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND IN CONTRAVENTION OF PROCEDURE 
ESTABLISHED BY JURISPRUDENCE.”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In support of the first assigned error, appellant insists that Epifania 
Lladones could not have made a proper identification of the offenders 
because: (1) The only illumination at the scene of the incident was a 
gas lamp which was placed in the kitchen. There were partitions between 
both the kitchen and the sala and the sala and the bedroom where she and
 her deceased husband were sleeping. There could not have been enough 
light for her to properly recognize the accused. (2) Having just been 
roused from sleep by one of the perpetrators who sat on the deceased's 
belly, she was most probably "in a state of shock or terror" and thus 
positive identification of the accused is highly improbable. Besides, 
she testified that the very reason for her rushing to the kitchen upon 
waking up was to get the gas lamp in order to see who her husband's 
attacker was. (3) Even when Epifania was overtaken by the accused and 
pinned under a table, visibility was still not sufficient as both were 
still some distance from the kitchen, the only source of illumination. 
(4) Finally, her claim that she had known the accused prior to the 
incident should have compelled the latter to have at least worn a mask 
so he would not be recognized.
</p><p>
Appellant also takes exception to the procedure undertaken by the police
 authorities on the day after the incident when he was brought to the 
hospital to be identified by Epifania Lladones. He laments that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The evidence for the prosecution also pointed out that on 
the 
following morning of the incident (August 1, 1981), Abelardo was made to
 face Epifania while the latter was still confined at the Albay 
Provincial Hospital for medical treatment of the hack wound she 
sustained and that Epifania pointed to Abelardo as one of the 
perpetrators of the offense charged. The defense submits that this 
particular procedure undertaken by the police in showing the victim, 
Epifania, a single person and asking her whether or not that man is one 
of those who perpetrated the offense, is most unfair and violative of 
the constitutional rights of the accused. The proper procedure should 
have been an identification in a line-up, whereby the suspect is made to
 line up with other persons who are not suspects at all, and then the 
victim is asked to point to whoever he or she recognizes as the 
perpetrator of the offense.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Anent the second assigned error, appellant claims that his 
constitutional rights to remain silent, to be entitled to counsel and to
 be informed of such rights "had no longer any meaning or purpose." This
 is because before giving his confession to the police investigator, he 
was interviewed by other policemen. The prosecution failed to show that 
in the said interview, the accused was apprised of his constitutional 
rights. He further avers that he initially disclaimed any responsibility
 for the crime but when manhandled, boxed and struck with a piece of 
wood on the head, he was forced to confess. Thus, the confession he 
prepared on 1 August 1981 (Exh. "B") is a mere formality in spite of his
 having been informed by the police investigator during the formal 
investigation of his constitutional rights.
</p><p>
And even conceding the absence of coercion during the initial interview,
 the signed confession would still be inadmissible as it does not appear
 that a valid waiver of the right to counsel was made by the accused.
</p><p>
In the People's Brief, the Solicitor General asserts the view that the 
principal issue to be resolved is whether or not the appellant was 
sufficiently identified as one of the culprits responsible for the 
offense.
</p><p>
Appellee avers, and We agree, that Epifania was able to sufficiently 
identify Abelardo Penillos as the person who sat on her husband's belly 
and demanded money from her. She testified that she was able to 
recognize Penillos when the latter pinned her down under the table; such
 identification was aided by her having known Penillos long before the 
incident, when the latter would go to the Lladones' house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>  She was even able to
 declare that Penillos was wearing short pants at the time of the 
commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
</p><p>
Furthermore, the illumination provided by the kerosene lamp was enough 
for Epifania to have recognized Penillos. This Court has held in the 
past that illumination produced by kerosene (gasera) lamps is sufficient
 for the identification of persons.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Where conditions of visibility are favorable, 
the ability of a witness to identify the malefactor should be 
upheld.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
</p><p>
The frenetic efforts of the appellant's counsel to cast doubt on the 
positive identification by Epifania, characterized by attempts to 
mislead the latter, proved to be a bad gamble for it only provided the 
prosecution a rare opportunity to elicit the details for the positive 
identification, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q How were you able to say that it was Billy Penillos who 
sat on 
the stomach of your husband and pointed the knife when you said there 
were two persons present inside your bedroom? </p>
  <p>
    A I recognized him; he was then wearing short-pant while his other 
companions was (sic) wearing long pants.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q And according to you after you ran away to get the lamp in the 
kitchen -- before you reached the kitchen, Billy Penillos twisted your 
arm and pinned you under a table. Is that correct?
  </p>
  <p>
    FISCAL:
  </p>
  <p>
    No. It is misleading, Your Honor please, because she was already in 
the kitchen. Before she could get hold of the lamp, that was the time 
when Abelardo Penillos twisted her right arm, she was already in the 
kitchen.
  </p>
  <p>
    COURT:
  </p>
  <p>
    Witness may answer. She is under cross-examination.
  </p>
  <p>
    A He placed me under the table.
  </p>
  <p> BENDAÑA: </p>
  <p>
    Q  And it was under the table that you recognized the face of Billy 
Penillos?
  </p>
  <p>
    A   While inside, I already recognized him inside. Before I have 
(sic) already recognized him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q Did you not testify a while ago that you ran towards the kitchen 
to get a lamp, so that, you can recognize the persons inside the room?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q And do you want to impress the (sic) Court that before you could 
get the lamp from the kitchen, you were already able to recognize Billy 
Penillos?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q And you were able to recognize Billy Penillos although at that 
time you were running towards the kitchen and Billy Penillos was behind 
inasmuch as he was sitting on the stomach of your husband?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Yes. I already recognized him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q So, your statement a while ago that you prefer (sic) in giving to 
the kitchen to get a lamp was to recognize who the persons were inside 
your house is not correct?
  </p>
  <p>
    A He was the very first one to get inside the house while his 
companions who were wearing long pants followed him. So I tried to 
recognize them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q Is there a partition between the kitchen and your room?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q And you said the lamp is (sic) situated inside the kitchen?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Yes, sir, because there was (sic) a door leading to that place.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q How far is the kitchen to your bed?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Very near.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q But the direct light of the lamp is (sic) being obstructed by the 
partition separating the bedroom and the kitchen?
  </p>
  <p>
    A The gas lamp was situated near the door.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q Is it the door of the room or near the door of the kitchen?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Near the door of the sala.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q So, you are now telling the Court that the lamp is (sic) near the 
sala, and not in the kitchen?
  </p>
  <p>
    A It is (sic) inside the kitchen but near the door leading to the 
sala.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q But your bedroom is inside a room which has a partition separating
 it from the sala. Is there a partition?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q So, you were not able to recognize the companions of Abelardo 
Penillos?
  </p>
  <p>
    A No, sir. I was not able to recognize the companions of Abelardo 
Penillos because when Abelardo Penillos ran to hold my husband and then 
suddenly his companions entered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    x x x
  </p>
  <p>
    Q So, the only moment that you were able to recognize Billy Penillos
 was while you were inside the room, and while Abelardo Penillos was 
demanding from you some money while you were being pinned under the 
table?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q And in these two instances where (sic) according to you, you 
recognized the face of Abelardo Penillos, first, when you were in the 
room, the room was still dark because the lamp was in the kitchen. Is 
that correct?
  </p>
  <p>
    A Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q And the second time that you recognized Billy Penillos was while 
you were being pinned under the table; and under the table it was also 
dark at that time. Is that correct?
  </p>
  <p>
    A No, not dark, because the light from the kitchen was illuminating 
the place wherein I was being pinned under the table. It was not dark.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q The table where you said you were pinned by Abelardo Penillos, how
 far was it from the kitchen?
  </p>
  <p>
    A About two meters.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q How big is this table?
  </p>
  <p> A It is small, we use it for our eating purposes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This Court cannot yield to the postulations of the appellant that 
Penillos would have worn a mask during the incident knowing as he did 
that Epifania was familiar with him and that the latter was impelled by 
evil motives in implicating him in the commission of the offense.
</p><p>
The first theory assumes that the wearing of masks to hide one's 
identity is a universal practice resorted to by criminals who are known 
to their prospective victims and who exercise utmost prudence and care 
in ensuring that no witness would be able to identify them while 
committing a crime. These assumptions are, of course, without any 
empirical basis and are, at best, speculative. On the other hand, the 
evil motive ascribed to Epifania by reason of an alleged prior verbal 
exchange between Penillos and her is a mere figment of the former's 
imagination. Such verbal disagreement allegedly arising from the refusal
 by Epifania to allow Penillos to use her yard as a pathway, even if 
true, is inconsequential, trivial and insufficient to move one to accuse
 another of committing robbery with homicide.
</p><p>
With his positive identification, appellant's defense of alibi must 
fail.
</p><p>
We defer to the conclusion by the court a quo that the protestations of 
the appellant "held in contrast with the positive identification made by
 Epifania Lopez on his complicity in the commission of the offense could
 not provide a justifiable ground to extricate him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> 
</p><p>
Appellant testified that between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. on 31 July 
1981, the day of the incident, he was travelling by carabao from Sitio 
Esperanza to Nauntogan, the place of the incident, a distance of about 
four (4) kilometers. He was allegedly accompanied by one Victor Maraño. 
Arriving at his destination at around 8:00 p.m., he proceeded to the 
house of his father-in-law, co-accused Mariano Maraño, which is about 
thirty (30) meters away from the residence of the victims. At the house 
of Mariano, appellant also encountered his other co-accused, Jose Nuyda 
and Romeo Nuyda. While having supper therein, appellant overheard 
Mariano and the Nuydas talking about something that they would divide 
among themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 
</p><p>
Appellee easily demolishes this defense by alleging that: Penillos 
alleged travel from Esperanza to Nauntogan was not even corroborated by 
his supposed companion, Victor Maraño, who was not presented as a 
witness; Penillos’ presence at the house of his co-accused, a mere 
thirty (30) meters away from the scene of the crime, militates against 
his defense in view of the positive identification by Epifania; and that
 it was not physically impossible for the appellant to have been at the 
place of the incident during the commission of the crime.
</p><p>
Settled is the rule that alibi cannot prevail over a positive 
identification made by a prosecution witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
  For alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that the accused was 
somewhere when the crime was committed but that he must also demonstrate
 that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of 
the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> 
</p><p>
Appellant also questions the manner in which he was initially identified
 by Epifania Lladones in the hospital while the latter was recuperating 
from her injury. The former contends that the procedure for conducting a
 police line-up should have been strictly followed. In People vs. 
Espiritu,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>  We 
ruled that 
there is no law requiring a police line-up as essential to a proper 
identification. Clearly then, this argument must also fail.
</p><p>
And now on the second assigned error. In respect to the allegation that 
the signed confession (Exh."B") was defective and should not have been 
admitted in evidence, the appellee practically concedes the irregularity
 when it avers thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    x x x
  </p>
  <p> “From the record, it appears that appellant's sworn 
statement was 
executed in a manner not in full accord with his right to the assistance
 of counsel. This may be been in the preliminary portion of the sworn 
statement, in which appellant was: </p>
  <p> ‘x x x reminded that under the new rules of the Constitution
 you 
have the right to remain silent and the right to have counsel of your 
own choice. You are also reminded that whatever you say here might be 
used for or against you in any court proceedings. Is this clearly 
under­stood by you? </p>
  <p>
  Answer: Yes sir.
  </p>
  <p>
  Question: After having been informed of your constitutional rights do 
you wish to proceed with this investigation?
  </p>
  <p>
  Answer: Yes sir.
  </p>
  <p>
  Question: Are you ready to give a free voluntary statement?
  </p>
  <p> Answer: Yes sir. (Folder of Exhib­its, p. 2).’
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Neither the preliminary portion aforecited nor the testimony of the 
investigating officer showed an affirmative offer to provide appellant 
with counsel de oficio if he could not retain counsel of his choice. 
Consequently, the sworn statement may very well be inadmissible and may 
not be utilized against appellant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 
</p><p>
Indeed it does not appear that constitutional safeguards afforded an 
accused under investigation for the commission of an offense were 
complied with. Aside from the Solicitor General's observations, it is 
clear that waiver of the right to counsel was not made in the presence 
of counsel. On cross?examination, police investigator Demosthenes 
Martillano testified:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    x x x
  </p>
  <p> "COURT: </p>
  <p>
    Q Why did you not place in the investigation that the witness is 
waiving his right to a (sic) counsel?

  <p>
    A That is my error.
  </p>
  <p> BENDAÑA: </p>
  <p>
    Q Why? What do you mean by that answer of yours that it was your 
error? Will you please explain to us that answer of yours?
  </p>
  <p>
    A All I know is that if the suspect does not need a counsel, I 
think, it was (sic) also suffice.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q Tell the court whether or not during the investigation Billy 
Penillos did not waive his right to a (sic) counsel?
  </p>
  <p>
    FISCAL:
  </p>
  <p>
    It is already stated, Your Honor please, in his statement that when 
the affiant chose to proceed with the investigation, to answer all 
questions, he in effect is waiving his right to a (sic) counsel after 
having been informed of all his rights.

The witness had already admitted that he did not place specifically that
 portion of waiver. But it does not mean that he did not ask the 
suspect. It is a matter of interpretation how you are going to interpret
 that portion of your question. The court under that respect will 
sustain the objection of the Fiscal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>

Even if the confession of an accused is gospel truth, if it was made 
without the assistance of counsel, it is inadmissible in evidence 
regardless of the absence of coercion or even if it had been voluntarily
 given.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  The 
same would necessarily apply to a waiver of the right to counsel not 
made in the presence of counsel.
</p><p>
In <em>Morales vs. Enrile,</em> et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup>  this Court, applying and 
interpreting Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution, which 
provides as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 20. No person shall be compelled to be a witness 
against 
himself. Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense
 shall have the right to remain silent and to counsel and to be informed
 of such right. No force, violence, threat, intimida­tion, or any other 
means which vitiates the free will shall be used against him. Any 
confession obtained in violation of this section shall be inadmissible 
in evidence."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
laid down the duties of an investigator during custodial interrogation 
and ruled that the waiver of the right to counsel shall not be valid 
unless made with the assistance of counsel, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "7.    At the time a person is arrested, it shall be the 
duty of 
the arresting officer to inform him of the reason for the arrest and he 
must be shown the warrant of arrest if any. He shall be informed of his 
constitutional rights to remain silent and to counsel, and that any 
statement he might make could be used against him. The person arrested 
shall have the right to communicate with his lawyer, a relative, or 
anyone he chooses by the most expedient means -- by telephone if 
possible -- or by letter or messenger. It shall be the responsibility of
 the arresting officer to see to it that this is accomplished. No 
custodial investigation shall be conducted unless it be in the presence 
of counsel engaged by the person arrested, by any person on his behalf, 
or appointed by the court upon petition either of the detainee himself 
or by anyone on his behalf. The right to counsel may be waived but the 
waiver shall not be valid unless made with the assistance of counsel. 
Any statement obtained in violation of the procedure herein laid down, 
whether exculpatory or inculpatory, in whole or in part, shall be 
inadmissible in evidence."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We reiterated the above ruling in People vs. Galit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>  People vs. Lumayok,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup>  People vs. 
Albofera<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup>  and 
People vs. Marquez.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> 
</p><p>
In view therefore of the law and jurisprudence, the sworn statement of 
appellant, Exhibit "B", is hereby declared inadmissible in evidence and 
should have been rejected by the trial court even if it is not in fact a
 confession for, as correctly observed by the People, it is exculpatory 
in nature. Just the same, since it was taken in violation of appellant's
 constitutional right to counsel, its exculpatory character did not cure
 the fatal defect.
</p><p>
We wish to underscore that Section 12(1) of Article III of the present 
Constitution has gone further to protect, promote and enhance the right 
to counsel of any person under investigation by expressly providing that
 such is a right "to have competent and independent counsel preferably 
of his own choice" and that it "cannot be waived except in writing and 
in the presence of counsel."
</p><p>
Be that as it may, We affirm the judgment of conviction by the trial 
court on the basis of the testimonies of the witnesses presented by the 
prosecution. Concluded the lower court: "The truth and as clearly borne 
by the evidence is: the defendant was among the perpetrators of the 
heinous offense. The robbery, left in its wake the death of Aproniano 
Lladones and the wounding of his wife Epifania Lopez Lladones."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> 
</p><p>
A trial court's findings of facts carry great weight for it has the 
privilege of examining the deportment and demeanor of witnesses and, 
therefore, can discern if such witnesses are telling the truth or 
not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup>
  In the light of the evidence presented in the proceedings below, We do
 not see any reason to disturb the lower court's factual conclusions.
</p><p>
We, however, modify the designation of the offense the appellant was 
convicted for on the basis of the information prepared by the then 
assistant city fiscal. The information should have charged the appellant
 simply with the special complex crime of Robbery with Homicide under 
Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code. This Court has consistently held 
that this offense is denominated as such regardless of the number of the
 homicides or injuries committed. These other circumstances merely serve
 as generic aggravating circumstances which can be offset by other 
mitigating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup>  There is no crime of robbery with homicide and
 frustrated homicide<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup>  or robbery with homicide and attempted 
homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup>
  The term "homicide" in paragraph 1, Article 294 of the Revised Penal 
Code is to be understood in its generic sense; it includes murder and 
slight physical injuries committed during the robbery which crimes are 
merged in the crime of robbery with homicide.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> 
</p><p>
The trial court, however, should have taken into consideration the 
aggravating circumstance of dwelling. Dwelling is aggravating in robbery
 with homicide because this type of robbery could be committed without 
the necessity of transgressing the sanctity of the home.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup>
  It is indisputably clear from the pleadings and the decision of the 
trial court that although the homicide was committed outside the house 
of the deceased, the principal offense of robbery was perpetrated 
inside; the killing thus occurred as a result of the initial evil design
 to steal.
</p><p>
The penalty for robbery with homicide and physical injuries defined 
under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code is reclusion perpetua to 
death. Considering the presence of the aggravating circumstance of 
dwelling, the greater penalty, which is death, shall be applied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup>
  However, in view of the abolition of the death penalty, the appellant 
is entitled to the reduced penalty of reclusion perpetua.
</p><p>
As noted from the dispositive portion of the challenged decision, the 
trial court imposed the penalty of "reclusion perpetua or life 
imprisonment." Evidently, it considered the latter as the English 
translation of the former, which is not the case. Both are different and
 distinct penalties. In the recent case of People vs. Baguio,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup>  this Court held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “The Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> does not 
prescribe the penalty of ‘life imprisonment’ for any of the felonies 
therein defined, that penalty being invariably imposed for serious 
offenses penalized not by the Revised Penal Code but by special laws. 
Reclusion perpetua entails imprisonment for at least thirty (30) years 
after which the convict becomes eligible for pardon, it also carries 
with it accessory penalties, namely: perpetual special disqualification,
 etc. It is not the same as ‘life imprisonment’ which, for one thing, 
does not carry with it any accessory penalty, and for another, does not 
appear to have any definite extent or duration."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As early as 1948, in People vs. Mobe,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup>  reiterated in People vs. Pilones<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup>  and in the 
concurring opinion of Justice Ramon Aquino in People vs. Sumadic,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup>
  this Court already made it clear that reclusion perpetua is not the 
same as imprisonment for life or life imprisonment. Every judge should 
take note of the distinction and this Court expects that, henceforth, no
 trial judge should mistake one for the other.
</p><p>
Finally, conformably with the stated policy of this Court, the award of 
civil indemnity in the amount of P20,000.00 is increased to 
P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> 
</p><p>
<strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> except as modified in its 
dispositive portion to specify that appellant Abelardo Penillo's penalty
 is to be <em>reclusion perpetua</em>,
 to remove the alternative reference therein to "life imprisonment" and 
to increase the indemnity for the death of Aproniano Lladones to be paid
 by him to the heirs of said deceased, the judgment of the trial court 
in Criminal Case No. 2144 is hereby AFFIRMED in all respects. The 
attempted homicide aspect of the charge is likewise deemed absorbed in 
one special complex crime of robbery with homicide, defined and 
penalized under Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, and the civil 
indemnity for the death of Aproniano Lladones is hereby increased to 
P50,000.00.
</p>
<p><strong>IT IS SO ORDERED</strong>.  </p>
