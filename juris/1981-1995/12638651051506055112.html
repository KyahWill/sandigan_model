<p class="BODY">The People's summary of the prosecution's evidence is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1985</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon, an informant went to the office of the First Narcotics Regional Unit
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The informant gave information that selling
of marijuana was rampant in <st1:place><st1:placename>Wright</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>

and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>appellant was involved
in said trafficking of marijuana (p. 3, TSN, December 23, 1987).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Acting on the information given by the informant, Captain
Emmanuel O. <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> formed a team composed of Sgt.
Alexander <span class="SpellE">Cao</span>, Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Maximiano</span></span><span class="GramE"> Peralta and A2FC Freddie
Cartel.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were instructed to
conduct a 'buy-bust operation' against appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cartel was designated to pose as buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cao</span>
and Pat.</span> Peralta would serve as the back-up of the team (pp. 8-9, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1987</st1:date>; p. 4, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1987</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the team was formed and the members were assigned their
specific functions, they went to <st1:place><st1:placename>Wright</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They reached <st1:place><st1:placename>Wright</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon (p. 4, TSN, September 23,
1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They saw appellant conversing
with somebody in front of a little store in <st1:place><st1:placename>Wright</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cartel and the informant approached appellant
while Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> and Pat. Peralta stayed about 15
meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While Cartel and appellant
were conversing, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> and Pat. Peralta then moved
closer until they were only about 4 to 5 meters away from Cartel and appellant
(pp. 4-6, TSN, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">ibid</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30 o'clock</st1:time>
in the<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>same afternoon, appellant returned
to Cartel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was carrying with him two
small sacks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Upon
appellant's arrival, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> and Pat.</span> Peralta
rushed to where Cartel and appellant were.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">They identified themselves as
NARCOM agents, confiscated the two bags and arrested appellant (pp. 9-12, TSN, <u>ibid</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They brought appellant to the police station
where he was investigated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was
charged the following </span>day <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(p. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">13, TSN <u>ibid</u>).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

contained 'marijuana' flowering tops' (p. 5, TSN, November 7, 1986)." (At

p. 85)<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant now raises before us the following
assignments of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT
THE SCHEME EMPLOYED BY THE NARCOM AGENTS WAS MERELY AN ENTRAPMENT OPERATION AND
NOT ONE WHICH INDUCED THE ACCUSED TO A COMMISSION OF AN OFFENSE, THE LATTER
BEING AN ABSOLUTORY CIRCUMSTANCE;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING
THE ACCUSED ON THE BASIS OF EVIDENCE OBTAINED IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 2,
ARTICLE III OF THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE <st1:country-region><st1:place>PHILIPPINES</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING
THE ACCUSED OF AN OFFENSE DIFFERENT FROM THAT CHARGED IN THE INFORMATION AND
DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH GIVE RISE TO REASONABLE DOUBT AS TO
HIS GUILT." (At pp. 43-44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention that the scheme used by the NARCOM agents
was instigation and not entrapment is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a bare allegation not borne by
evidence on the part of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">As seen from the facts, the operation conducted by the police
officers was clearly one of entrapment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Valmores</span>, 122 SCRA 922
[1983] clearly elucidates the difference between entrapment and
instigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"In an entrapment,
ways and means are resorted to for the purpose of trapping and capturing the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">law </span>breakers in the execution of their
criminal plan; whereas in instigation, the instigator practically induces the
would-be defendant into the commission of the offense and he himself becomes a
co-principal." There is no such inducement in the case before us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the police officers did
not know the petitioner beforehand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no reason for the NARCOM agents to induce appellant to violate
the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the records
which could explain why the prosecution witnesses would fabricate their
testimonies and implicate appellant in such a serious crime (People v. <span class="SpellE">Rodante</span> Bautista, 147 SCRA 500 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The principal prosecution witnesses are all
law enforcers, and are therefore, presumed to have regularly performed their duty
in the absence of proof to the contrary (People v. Neil <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>,
G.R. No. 81520, February 21, 1989; People v. <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
de Jesus, 145 SCRA 521 [1986]; People v. Alvarez, G.R. No. 70446, January 31,
1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, what is evident from the records is the criminal
resolve of the accused even before the NARCOM agents met him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was precisely on the basis of a report
that there was rampant drug trafficking at <st1:place><st1:placename>Wright</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> that the buy-bust operation
was conducted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused was already
pushing marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The agents simply
waited for appellant to ply his trade and then trapped him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The existence beforehand of such unlawful trade is evident from
the fact that the accused-appellant had a ready supply of marijuana to meet the
buyers' demands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He might not have had
it right at the time the initial transaction took place but he was readily able
to produce the desired quantity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, it took him only a few minutes to produce the marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it were really true that he was induced
into looking for marijuana, it would have taken him a considerable length of
time to look for a source.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The fact that he returned shortly after the transaction shows that
he already had contacts from whom he could readily get the marijuana.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is clearly not a case where an innocent person is induced to
commit a crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is simply a trap to
catch the criminal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant further questions the non?presentation
of the informant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This allegation is of
no moment since it is up to the Fiscal to present his witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of the informant as witness is
not fatal (People v. <span class="SpellE">Cerelegia</span>, 147 SCRA 538
[1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is a need to
protect the identity of informers to enable them to help in the identification
of drug traffickers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The non-presentation of the poseur-buyer, Cartel, was likewise
assailed by the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was,
however, satisfactorily explained by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cartel's whereabouts are unknown because he was
already discharged from the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
even in the absence of the testimony of said poseur-buyer, the evidence against
the accused remains strong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> and Pat.</span> Peralta's
testimonies corroborate each other regarding the delivery of marijuana by <span class="SpellE">Asio</span> to Cartel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second issue raised by the accused is the absence of a warrant
of arrest or search warrant when the two (2) bags were seized from him and he
was arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule that a search and seizure must be supported by a valid
warrant is not an absolute one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
are recognized exceptions to the rule among them, 1) a search incidental to an
arrest; 2) a search of a moving vehicle; and 3) the seizure of evidence in
plain view (Mariposa, Jr. v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 143 SCRA
267).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Par. a, Sec. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">6, </span>Rule 113 of the Rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>Court specifically states:</p>

<blockquote>"A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant
arrest a person:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"a) when the person to be arrested has committed, is actually
committing, or is about to commit an <u>offense</u> in his presence x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A search and seizure without a warrant is allowed in buy-bust
operations, the circumstances being among those which can be considered
exceptional.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>this
case, was caught red-handed while pushing marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he could be lawfully arrested and
searched.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the accused-appellant alleges that he was convicted of an
offense different from that charged in the information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, he was charged under Sec. <span class="GramE">21(b</span>) in relation to Sec. 4 of Art. II of the Dangerous
Drugs Act, which states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 21.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Attempt</u> <u>and</u> <u>Conspiracy </u>-
The same penalty prescribed by this Act for the commission of the offense shall
be imposed in the case of any attempt or conspiracy to commit the same in the
following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b) <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>,
administration, delivery, distribution and transportation of dangerous
drugs;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">His conviction was, according to him, based on a different
provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is Sec. 4 of the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Article which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging
from twenty thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be imposed upon any person
who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, administer, deliver, give away to
another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any prohibited drug, or
shall act <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>a broker in any of
such transactions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the victim of the
offense is a minor, or should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>prohibited
drug involved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>any offense
under this Section be the proximate cause of the death of a victim thereof, the
maximum penalty herein provided shall be imposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(As amended by PD No. 1675, February 17,
1980)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing inconsistent about the two provisions, they
referring to one and the same offense and carrying with it the same
penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 21(b) of RA 6425 merely
specified the manner of violation of the prohibited acts mentioned in Section 4
of the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Article.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant further argues that the Information does
not charge only one offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
contention is without basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
only one offense <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">charged - the
violation of Sec. 4 of RA 6425.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
words "sell, deliver, distribute, dispatch in </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">transit</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or transport merely
describe the specific acts constituting the violation of Section 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the alleged defect has become
academic at this point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should have
been properly raised in a motion to quash before the </span>appellant pleaded
to the Information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">do </span>so is deemed a waiver in
accordance with Section 8, Rule 117 of the 1985 Rule on Criminal Procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is one other important reason why this appeal should be
dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the records of this
case were transmitted from the Court of Appeals <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1988</st1:date>
where they were erroneously forwarded, the accused-appellant escaped from
detention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">His </span>own lawyer says he could not contact the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that basis alone, the appeal may be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the decision of the trial
court is AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.</p>
