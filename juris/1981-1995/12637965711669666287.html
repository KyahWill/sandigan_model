<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Petitioners raised the

<p class=2Q>1.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Respondent judge cannot
legally stay execution of judgment that has already become final and <span
class=SpellE>executory</span>;</p>

<p class=2Q>2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The placing under
receivership by the Central Bank of the respondent bank, long after the
complaint was filed removed it from the application of the doctrine in Re:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Central Bank vs. <span class=SpellE>Morfe</span>
(63 SCRA 113);</p>

<p class=2Q>3.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The filing of the
complaint for a sum of money with damages against respondent bank and the
subsequent attachment of its property in <span class=SpellE>Pasig</span>, Metro
Manila long before the receivership took place render inapplicable the doctrine
laid down by this Honorable Supreme Court in the said <span class=SpellE>Morfe</span>
case;</p>

<p class=2Q>4.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The indefinite stay of
execution without a ruling as to how long it will last, amounts to deprivation
of petitioners of their property without due process of law.</p>

<p class=2Q>The instant petition is without merit.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS>I.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>The main issue in this
case is whether or not respondent judge could legally stay execution of
judgment that has already become final and <span class=SpellE>executory</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>The answer is in the
affirmative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>The rule that once a
decision becomes final and <span class=SpellE>executory</span>, it is the
ministerial duty of the court to order its execution, admits of certain
exceptions as in cases of special and exceptional nature where it becomes
imperative in the higher interest of justice to direct the suspension of its
execution (<span class=SpellE>Vecine</span> vs. Geronimo, 59 O.G. 579); whenever
it is necessary to accomplish the aims of justice (<span class=SpellE>Pascual</span>
vs. Tan, 85 Phil. 164); or when certain facts and circumstances transpired
after the judgment became final which could render the execution of the
judgment unjust (<span class=SpellE>Cabrias</span> vs. <span class=SpellE>Adil</span>,
135 SCRA 354).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>In the instant case, the
stay of the execution of judgment </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt'>is
</span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>warranted by the fact that
respondent bank was place under receivership.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>To execute the judgment would unduly deplete the assets of respondent
bank to the obvious prejudice of other depositors and creditors, since, as
aptly stated in Central Bank of the Philippines vs. <span class=SpellE>Morfe</span>
(63 SCRA 114), after the Monetary Board has declared that a bank is insolvent
and has ordered it to cease operations, the Board becomes the trustee of its
assets for the equal benefit of all the creditors, including depositors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The assets of the insolvent banking
institution are held in trust for the equal benefit of all creditors, and after
its insolvency, one cannot obtain an advantage or a preference over another by
an attachment, execution or otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Moreover, it will be
noted that respondent bank was placed under receivership on </span><st1:date
Year="1984" Day="10" Month="8"><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>August
 10, 1984</span></st1:date><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>, and the Decision
of respondent judge is dated </span><st1:date Year="1984" Day="13" Month="11"><span
 style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>November 13, 1984</span></st1:date><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Accordingly, in line with the ruling in the aforesaid <span
class=SpellE>Morfe</span> case, <span class=GramE>which reads:</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=2Q>&quot;The circumstance that the Fidelity Savings Bank, having
stopped operations since <st1:date Year="1969" Day="19" Month="2">February 19,
 1969</st1:date>, was forbidden to do business (and that ban would include the
payment of time deposits) implies that suits for the payment of such deposits
were prohibited.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What was directly
prohibited should not be encompassed indirectly.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>x <span class=SpellE>x</span> <span
class=SpellE><span class=GramE>x</span></span><span class=GramE> .&quot;</span></p>

<p class=NUMROMANS><span class=GramE>II.</span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>It is the contention of
petitioners, however, that the placing under receivership of respondent bank
long after the filing of the complaint removed it from the doctrine in the said
<span class=SpellE>Morfe</span> case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>This contention is
untenable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The time of the filing of the
complaint is immaterial.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is the
execution that will obviously prejudice the </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>creditors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

class=SpellE>Morfe</span> case, the effect of </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class=NUMROMANS><span class=GramE>III.</span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>Anent the contention of
petitioners that the attachment of one of the properties of respondent bank was
erased by virtue of the delayed receivership is to expand the power of the

mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>say </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>that
in the case of Central Bank of the Philippines, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et

wherein the original plaintiff <span class=SpellE>Algue</span> Inc. was able to
obtain a writ of preliminary attachment against the original defendant Island
Savings Bank, this Court refused to recognize any preference resulting from
such attachment and ruled that after a declaration of insolvency, the remedy of
the depositors is to intervene in the liquidation proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=NUMROMANS><span class=GramE>IV.</span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>It is also contended by

style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>as </span><span

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>Said contention,
likewise, is devoid of merit.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apart from
