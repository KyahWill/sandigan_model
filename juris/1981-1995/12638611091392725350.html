<p class="BODY">The arrest of the four accused, except <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>
Flores, was effected <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>a result
of a "buy-bust" mission conducted by the intelligence division of the

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented six witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Edmund <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span>,
of the San Fernando PC, declared that on August 24, 1982, he was contacted by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a civilian </span>informant
that he, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">informant, had been told
by the accused <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> Flores "that he knows of
some marijuana pushers at <span class="SpellE">Bagulin</span>," in San
Fernando, La Union; that he alerted his fellow-soldiers in order to map out a
modus operandi to bring the said dope peddlers to justice; that they agreed
that it was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">certain Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Yaranon</span> who would act as buyer-poseur; that they proceeded
to <span class="SpellE">Aguyan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pugo</span>, of the
same municipality where they met their informer, <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>
Flores, and Ben <span class="SpellE">Bulaoy</span>; that they were allegedly
instructed to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Bacsil</span> (same municipality)
because Flores and <span class="SpellE">Bulaoy</span> were going to </span><span class="SpellE">Dagup</span>, to contact their sources; they, <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span>
and his backup, however, allegedly told Flores and <span class="SpellE">Bulaoy</span>
that they could not wait and promised to meet the team on the 28th; then on the
said date, they met Flores and <span class="SpellE">Bulaoy</span> who further
instructed them to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Lower <span class="SpellE">Bimmotubot</span> in <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, La Union
where the alleged transaction would take place; that upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">arriving there, </span>Flores and <span class="SpellE">Bulaoy</span> allegedly made them wait in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>hut; that five men, one of whom,
the accused Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>, arrived toting a sack
of dried marijuana leaves; that they allegedly haggled over the price with <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>; and that at that precise moment he, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span>, <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> at his back-up
who swept down on the foursome to make the arrest; that, however,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Flores allegedly jumped out of the window and
managed to escape; that the quartet of <span class="SpellE">Bulaoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> were thereafter taken to the PC headquarters and
the plants turned over to the PC laboratory, which were positively found to be <b>cannabis</b>
<b>sativa</b>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution thereafter put Patrolman Emilio <span class="SpellE">Yaranon</span> on the stand, in which he corroborated <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So did
Patrolman Edwin Benavidez, Sergeant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Gacunasa</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>, and Captain
Valentino <span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span> as its first witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His version is that he knew <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Bulaoy</span>; that on August 28, 1982, at or about 12:00 noon, he
was called by a certain Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Layugan</span> who had been
allegedly conversing with three male persons (<span class="SpellE">Hufana</span>
and two others whom he claimed he did not know), to assist him, <span class="SpellE">Layugan</span>, because he did not allegedly speak <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>; that subsequently, he, <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span>,
cooked food for the three; that thereupon, he saw <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>
whom he asked to catch fish; that <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> later
returned with canned fish and other food; that thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>
Flores arrived carrying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>sack which turned out to contain <span class="SpellE">tetrahydrocannabinol</span>,
or marijuana; that moments later, <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span> trained his
firearm at Flores, who, however, managed to jump out of the window and made
good his escape; that <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span> allegedly took a shot at
Flores but apparently missed; that the latter repaired to the house; that he
allegedly made <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Layugan</span>,
lie spread-eagle on the floor; that at such a precise time, <span class="SpellE">Hufana's</span>
companions, three in number, clamped upon <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>
who was also made to lie face down to the ground where all three were later
bound; that all three were led to a "Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span>";
that Linda <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>, mother of the accused <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>, inquired:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Why are you getting those people;" that <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span>
allegedly riposted, "We will get them only for questioning and they will
come back later;" that the three were transported aboard the <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span>; that while there, a certain Benny produced three
bundles of marijuana and declared, "<span class="SpellE">Pagkakakwartahan</span>
<span class="SpellE">natin</span> <span class="SpellE">ito</span>"; that they
were taken to the PC headquarters at San Fernando, La Union, where they were
detained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version, on the other hand, of <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>
is to the effect that on August 28, 1982, he went to a certain Ruben Mendoza's
house where he agreed to meet <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>certain <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span> <span class="SpellE">Caluza</span> who was selling cattle; that upon arriving at the
Mendoza residence, he saw only Ruben; that while he waited he heard two
gunshots coming from the house of <span class="SpellE">Layugan</span>; that he
proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Layugan's</span> residence in order to verify
matters; and that thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span> called him while
Edwin Benavidez, also a police operative, pushed him; that Benavidez poked his
gun at him; that he also saw <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> lying face down; he corroborated <span class="SpellE">Caranay's</span> testimony as to the inquiries of <span class="SpellE">Carreon's</span> mother and the fact that "Benny" had
taken interest in the substance.</p>

<p class="BODY">He added, however, that while at the PC headquarters at San
Fernando, La Union, they were made to impress their thumbprints on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a piece </span>of
paper on police pretenses that "they could go home" thereafter; that
he protested because he did not know the contents of the paper; that they were
incarcerated until September 5, 1982, after which they were transported to <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, where they were held for a month, and then
returned to San Fernando.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bulaoy's</span> story is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that he had been at San Fernando because his
aunt summoned him to help till their land; that on August 28, 1982, he was at
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pias</span>; that he saw a man pushing a "Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span>" along the road; that another man was behind the
wheel; that they asked him help to push the vehicle; that after the car
started, he hopped in; that when he later asked them to let him off, one of
them said "not yet," that instead he was brought to the PC
headquarters in San Fernando; that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>later taken to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bimmotubot</span>, where he was left in the company of two
soldiers; that meanwhile, the two men who had accosted him picked up <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> Flores; that when they returned, they were with <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span>, all bound at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
hands; that they proceeded toward <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span>, La Union;
that later, "Benny" brought out paper </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">bags </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">containing "grass" and uttered:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Pagkakakwartahan</span>,
Pare"; that they were taken to San Fernando PC headquarters where they
were allegedly mauled and forced to admit ownership of the <span class="SpellE">sackful</span>
of <span class="SpellE">tetrahydrocannabinol</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> testified that on August 28,
1982, <span class="SpellE">Layugan</span> called him to ask him to trap fish for
certain visitors' request; that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>after
catching fish, he returned where he,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
together</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span>,
prepared the meal; that three persons later arrived, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">one </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of whom (Flores) toted </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sack;
that <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span>, one of the visitors, opened it up; that
he, <span class="SpellE">Hufana</span>, held Flores by the arm; that notwithstanding,
the latter managed to jump out of the window and was able to escape; that
moments later, he heard five gunshots; that they, <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>,
were </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">all </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">made to drop on the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">floor, where they were </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hogtied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1987</st1:date>,
the lower court rendered a 40-page judgment, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">WHEREFORE, and in view of the foregoing premises, judgment is
hereby <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rendered as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">1. The accused Ben <span class="SpellE">Bula-oy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span> are hereby
acquitted of the crime charged in the Information, on the ground that their
guilt are (sic) not proven beyond reasonable doubt, and, accordingly, the
Provincial Warden of La Union is hereby ordered to release them immediately,
unless they are detained for another offense;</p>

<p class="2Q">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding the accused
Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
the offense charged in the Information, he is hereby sentenced to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, and
to pay </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a fine </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>twenty thousand (P20,000.00) pesos;
and<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ordering the confiscation
and forfeiture of the marijuana leaves in favor of the Government, and the
Clerk of Court is hereby ordered to immediately turn over the said marijuana
leaves to the Dangerous Drugs Board for proper disposal without delay.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">With costs against the accused Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">SO ORDERED.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court acquitted, but one, all of the accused for
failure of the prosecution to establish conspiracy beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It rejected the defense's version
that it was <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> Flores who owned the sack of
Indian <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hemp, but rather <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span> himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span> alone was held culpable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court feels that the trial judge should have convicted all
four, for conspiracy to distribute marijuana. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It is clear, from their testimonies, that all
four were bent on pinning solitary blame on <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>
Flores and were determined to cover up for the others’ part in committing the
offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is evidence of conspiracy
and collective guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the prosecution witnesses were straightforward and
spontaneous in their recital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
defense has not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">successfully shown </span>any
motive on the part of the prosecution, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>matter of grudge, to persecute them.</p>

<p class="BODY">For all its errors, however, the lower court must be
sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span> is guilty, having been positively identified as
the carrier of a marijuana sack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
effort, as we said, to point sole fault to <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>
Flores can not negative the clear and convincing evidence presented by the
prosecution that he is guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With
respect to his co-accused, double jeopardy is a bar in reexamining the cases
against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, in letting them go
scot-free, he, <span class="SpellE">Sayang-od</span>, winds up being the fall
guy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And while he can not be acquitted,
judicial sympathy is on his side.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered AFFIRMING the
decision appealed from.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We, however,
strongly recommend executive clemency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Let the Department of Justice be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">furnished
a copy of this Decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
