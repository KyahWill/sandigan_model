<p class="BODY">These four cases involving the same parties and arising from the
same facts were jointly tried upon agreement of the parties.  After due trial, the trial court rendered
judgment convicting the accused in Criminal Case Nos. T-761 and T-769 for
murder and frustrated murder, respectively, and acquitting the accused in
Criminal Cases Nos. T-783 and T-784 attempted homicide.  The dispositive portion of the decision
ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“THEREFORE, in RESUME of the four (4) above-mentioned respective

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, the accused in Criminal Cases Nos. T-761 and T-769
filed an appeal to the Court of Appeals.  As accused Jimmy Villanueva had jumped bail, the Court of Appeals made
it clear that only Juanito Villanueva and Rudy Villanueva are deemed to have
interposed the appeal.  After the briefs
were filed, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“In view of the foregoing and pursuant to Section 13, Rule 124 of
the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure; judgment is hereby rendered in CA-G.R. CR
No. 07331; finding accused-appellants guilty of the crime of murder, as charged
in the Information, and sentencing them to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>; to pay the heirs of the deceased Justiniano Paloyo, jointly
and severally, the sum of P50,000.00 (Supreme Court Resolution <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u>
of August 30, 1990; People vs. Daniel Sison, No. 86455, September 14, 1990;
People vs. Dante Bartolay, G.R. No. 83696, December 21, 1990) and to pay the
costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In addition, accused-appellant Rudy Villanueva, who is a parolee,
is ordered to serve the unserved or unexpired portion of his sentence under his
previous conviction (tsn, p. 7, August 26, 1986).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Let the records of the case be elevated to the Honorable Supreme
Court for review, and it is understood that no entry of judgment shall issue
until after the Supreme Court shall have acted on the case, with finality.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In CA-G.R. CR No. 07332, appellant Rudy Villanueva is likewise
found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated murder, defined
and penalized under Article 248, in relation to Article 50, <u>supra</u>; and
is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of SEVEN (7) YEARS and TEN (10)
DAYS of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u>, as minimum, to THIRTEEN (13) YEARS and TEN
(10) DAYS of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as maximum, and to pay the
proportionate costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SO ORDERED.”  (pp. 133-134,
Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court has thereby been called upon to review the judgment
only in CA-G.R. No. 07331 which is the appeal from the judgment of conviction
in Criminal Case No. T-761 for Murder against accused Rudy Villanueva, and
Juanito “Ben” Villanueva considering that the Court of Appeals found the said
accused-appellants guilty of the crime of murder and had sentenced them to <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>.  Under Section 17 (1)
of the Judiciary Act, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review, reverse,
modify or affirm on appeal, as the law or Rules of Court may provide, final
judgments and decrees of inferior courts in all criminal cases involving
offenses for which the penalty imposed is death or life imprisonment.  Thus, the Court of Appeals properly
refrained from issuing an entry of judgment until the Supreme Court shall have
acted on the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, as gleaned from the testimony of the
witnesses the prosecution are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of December 27, 1985, at around three (3:00)
o’clock, Marcelino Paloyo, his son Antonio Paloyo and friends, Dionisio Alarcio
and Nicanor Otanes (referred to as the Paloyo group) were collecting empty
sacks from farmers in Barangay Abot-Molina, Umingan, Pangasinan when they
chanced upon Vino Villanueva who invited them to attend the wedding party of
Merle Villanueva.  Upon learning that
one of the wedding sponsors was Justiniano, Marcelino Paloyo’s brother, the
group readily accepted the invitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">A little later, when they arrived at the wedding reception, the
Paloyo group saw Justiniano Paloyo drinking liquor with Vino Villanueva, Rudy
Villanueva, Juanito “Ben” Villanueva, Jimmy Villanueva, Meliton Villanueva,
Maning Cariño and Johnny Tualla.  At
around four o’clock in the afternoon, the Paloyo group left the party with
Justiniano Paloyo.  While they were
about five hundred (500) meters away from the ‘Villanuevas’ house, one of the
Villanuevas signalled at them to wait as he had something to tell them.  When the Villanuevas reached the place where
the Paloyo group was waiting, Jimmy alias “Eming” Villanueva and Juanito “Ben”
Villanueva held Justiniano Paloyo on the shoulders while Rudy Villanueva
stabbed him on and on until he fell to the ground.  At this juncture, Vino Villanueva and Meliton Villanueva, instead
of answering Marcelino Paloyo’s query why Justiniano was being attacked also
held Marcelino on the shoulders while Rudy Villanueva started stabbing
him.  The fallen Marcelino Paloyo called
for his companions to help him.  Nicanor
Otanes, Dionisio Alarcio and Antonio Paloyo rushed to his aid.  The Villanuevas however away only to return
later and chase the Paloyo group who took shelter at the house of Dalmacio
Molina leaving behind the lifeless body of Justiniano Paloyo lying on the
ricefield.  From Dalmacio Molina’s
place, Marcelino Paloyo was brought to the Medicare Hospital in Umingan,
Pangasinan for immediate treatment.  He
was later transferred to the Eastern Pangasinan General Hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense, on the other hand, espoused a different version of
the fateful event of December 27, 1985 in Barangay Abot-Molina. Witnesses said
that Marcelino Paloyo arrived at the wedding party of Merle Villanueva
drunk.  Yet, he and his companions were
welcomed by the Villanuevas since they were visitors.  After sometime, Juanito Villanueva and his cousin Jimmy
Villanueva proceeded to the basketball court and the Paloyo group joined
them.  Along the way, Marcelino Paloyo
uttered the following words:  “Addento
maaramid nga arte” (Something will happen which is an art) and shot Jimmy
Villanueva on the left thigh.  A free
for all fight ensued.  Marcelino Paloyo
and Jimmy Villanueva grappled with each other even as they fell into the
mud.  Jimmy Villanueva called for help,
so Juanito also jumped into the mud and noticed that Jimmy was holding a
“veinte-nueve” knife.  Justiniano Paloyo
shot Jimmy on the leg.  Then Marcelino
Paloyo and his companions ran away while Juanito Villanueva and Jimmy
Villanueva were brought to Baguio for treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">As aforesaid, from the judgment of conviction, the accused
appealed to the Court of Appeals the following assignment <span style="">of </span>errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THAT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THERE WAS CONSPIRACY IN
THE OFFENSE CHARGED.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>THAT THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT ACCEPTING THEIR DEFENSE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>THAT THE DECISION APPEALED FROM IS CONTRARY TO THE EVIDENCE AND THE
LAW.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants contend that the court erred in deducing
conspiracy from the evidence presented.  They alleged that the prosecution failed to prove the participation of
Juanito and Jimmy Villanueva in the murder of Justiniano Paloyo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants’ denial <span style="">of</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span>the existence of conspiracy is antagonistic to
the evidence on hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement
concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.  The objective of the conspirators is to
perform the act or omission punishable by law.  What is required is assent to the perpetration of such misdeed.  There is a need for concurrence of wills or unity
of action or purpose or common and joint purpose and design.  If there is a chain of circumstances to that
effect, conspiracy is deemed to have been established.  If such be the case, then the act of one is
the act of all the others involved and each is to be held in the same degree of
liability as the others  (People vs
Quijano, G.R. No. 84361, May 31, 1991).  In this case, the hapless Justiniano Paloyo was held on the shoulders by
Juanito and Jimmy Villanueva while he was stabbed by Rudy Villanueva.  His brother Marcelino Paloyo was also held
on the shoulders by Vino and Nelson Villanueva when he was attacked by Rudy
Villanueva.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following testimony of Marcelino Paloyo indubitably proves
the existence of conspiracy:</p>

<blockquote>“Fiscal Evangelista:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rudy
Villanueva, Sir.”  (p. 167, TSN, August
26, 1986)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case of People vs. Solis (G.R No. 93628, March 18, 1991),
this Court declared that the concerted acts of the appellants to attain a
common criminal objective signify conspiracy.  Their respective acts of boxing, beating and stabbing the victim show a
unity of action and singleness of purpose to inflict physical harm.  It is not necessary that there be evidence
of previous plan or agreement to commit the assault.  It is sufficient that at the time of the aggression, all the
accused manifested by their acts of common intent or desire to attack so that
the act of one accused becomes the act of all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy having been established, all the conspirators are
liable as co-principals regardless of the extent and character of their
participation because in contemplation of the law, the act of one is the act of
all (People vs. Base, G.R. No. 92124, May 6,1991).</p>

<p class="BODY">Rudy Villanueva’s defense of alibi that he was not even at the
scene of the crime does not also ring true.  Well-established is the rule that alibi is unavailing against positive
identification of the accused by credible witnesses.  Neither will it prosper in the absence of satisfactory showing of
the physical impossibility of the accused being present at the scene of the
crime at the time of its commission.  Appellant Rudy Villanueva was approximately only 300-500 meters away
from the scene of the crime.  For his
defense of alibi to prosper, the accused must prove that he was somewhere else
when the crime was committed and it was physically impossible for him to have
been at the scene of the crime (People vs. Aniñon, 158 SCRA 701).  Moreover, Rudy Villanueva was positively
pointed to by the prosecution’s witnesses as the one who stabbed the
victims.  This Court has time and again
pronounced that the defense of alibi would not prosper in view of the
convincing and positive identification of accused as the perpetrators of the
crime.  Treachery was also properly
appreciated against the accused-appellants.  The victims were stabbed without warning.  So sudden was the attack on them that they were not even given a
chance to defend themselves as shown by the severity and multiplicity of wounds
inflicted on them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for murder as provided for by Article 248 of the
Revised Penal Code is <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal</u></span> in its maximum period
to death.  In the absence of any
aggravating or mitigating circumstance, the penalty to be imposed on Rudy
Villanueva and Juanito “Ben” Villanueva is <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>perpetua</u>.  </span>The Court of Appeals properly
sentenced them to suffer the penalty of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>perpetua</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment of conviction against Juanito Villanueva
and Rudy Villanueva in Criminal Case No. T-761 is AFFIRMED, as properly
modified by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 07331 as to the penalty imposed
