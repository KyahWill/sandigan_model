Automatic review of a decision of the defunct Circuit Criminal Court, 7th Judicial District, which imposed the death penalty.
<p>
An information for robbery with homicide was filed on October 1, 1971, 
against Danilo Tobias and a John Doe. The order to arrest Tobias was 
returned unserved and he is still on the "Wanted Persons Files."
</p><p>
On December 7, 1971, the information was amended to name <em>Hernando Dio</em> as the John Doe, the appellant herein. As amended, the information reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 24th day of July 1971, in Pasay City, 
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused Danilo Tobias @ Danny Kulot and Hernando Dio @ Way 
Kaon, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping one 
another, with intent to gain and without the knowledge and consent of 
the owner, and with the use of a 'balisong', one of the accused was 
provided with, and by means of force, threats and intimidation employed 
upon the latter, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously
 take, steal and rob away from one Crispulo P. Alega, one Seiko brand 
men's wrist watch (recovered); and the said accused in accordance with 
and pursuant to their conspiracy, and in order to carry out their avowed
 purpose, with intent to kill did then and there wilfully, unlawfully 
and feloniously attack, assault and stab for several times Crispulo P. 
Alega, and which 'balisong' was directly aimed at the vital portions of 
the body of said Crispulo P. Alega, thus performing all the acts of 
execution causing his instantaneous death." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 68.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Accused Hernando Dio pleaded not guilty when he was arraigned and after trial the court rendered the following judgment:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, finding the accused, Hernando Dio, Guilty, beyond 
reasonable doubt, of the crime of Robbery with Homicide as defined under
 Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, as charged in the Amended 
Information, the Court hereby sentences him to suffer the penalty of 
DEATH; to indemnify the heirs of the victim, Crispulo Alega the amount 
of P12,000.00; to pay moral damages in the amount of P10,000.00 and 
another P10,000.00, as exemplary damages; and to pay the costs." (Id., 
pp. 105-106.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The People's version of the facts is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "At about noontime on July 24, 1971, Crispulo Alega, a civil 
engineer by profession working at the Sugay Construction Company, with a
 salary of more than P500.00 a month, went to the Southeastern College, 
Pasay City to fetch his girlfriend, Remedios Maniti, a third year high 
school student thereat (pp. 55, 59, 63­64, tsn., January 11, 1973). They
 proceeded to the Pasay City Public Market. As they were going up the 
stairs leading to the Teresa and Sons Restaurant, Remedios, who was 
walking about an arms-length ahead of Crispulo suddenly heard the 
dropping of her folders and other things, being carried by Crispulo. 
When she looked back, she saw a man - later identified as Danilo Tobias 
but still at large - twisting the neck of Crispulo, while the appellant 
was holding his (Crispulo's) two hands (pp. 56-57, 61, tsn., id.). The 
appellant and his companion tried to divest Crispulo of his 'Seiko' 
wrist watch, but Crispulo resisted their attempt and fought the robbers.
 At this juncture, the man who was twisting the neck of Crispulo stabbed
 the latter on the left side of his chest. Crispulo ran down the stairs 
followed by Remedios who shouted for help. When he reached the front of 
the Pasay Commercial Bank he fell down and expired. At the time of his 
death, the 'Seiko' watch was still strapped to his wrist. (pp. 57-61, 
tsn., id., pp. 7-9, tsn., Jan. 22, 1973). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
An autopsy conducted on the victim's body by Dr. Ricardo Ibarola, 
medico-legal officer of the NBI revealed that the cause of death was a 
stab wound at the region below his left breast which penetrated the 
heart. Said doctor opined that judging from the natural appearance of 
the stab wound, it must have been caused by a single-bladed pointed 
instrument (pp. 6, 13-14, tsn., Jan. 11, 1973; Exh. C and C-1, p. 87, 
rec.). The necropsy report (Exh. A, p. 85, rec.) stated that the 
deceased sustained the following injuries:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    'Abrasions: right zygomatic region, 0.6 x 0.4 cm. infra-labial 
region, right side 1.7 x 1.4 cm.; forearm right, upper third, 
postero-lateral aspect, 0.6 x 0.4 cm. and left, lower third, posterior 
aspect, 0.4 x 0.2 cm.; right knee, 0.6 x 0.4 cm; right leg, upper third,
 anterior aspect, 1.4 x 0.8 cm.
  </p>
  <p>
    'Incise wounds, neck, left supero-lateral aspect, two in number, 2.5 and 1.2 cm. in lengths, both superficial.
  </p>
  <p> 'Stab wound: left inframmamary region, level of the 5th 
intercostal space along the parasternal line, 6.0 cm. from the anterior 
midline, 0.5 cm. below the left nipple, elliptical in shape, 3.0 cm. 
long extended laterally by 3.0 cm, long rising slightly downwards, 
medially edges, clean cut, sutured, medial extremity of which is blunt 
and lateral extremity, sharp; directed upwards, medially and backwards 
involving, among others, the soft tissues, thru the 5th intercostal 
muscles, grazing the 6th rib superiorly, perforating the left pleural 
cavity only, into the middle mediastinum by penetrating the pericardium 
antero-inferiorly, perforating the left pleural cavity only, into the 
middle mediastinum by penetrating the pericardium antero-inferiorly, 
perforating the interventricular system and penetrating the left 
ventricle of the heart at its apical portions, approximate depth 11.0 
cm."
  </p>
  <p> "After the appellant's arrest on October 24, 1972, he was 
investigated at the Detective Bureau of the Pasay City Police Department
 and gave a statement (Exh. D, p. 90, rec.) in the presence of Pat. 
Arturo Rimorin admit­ting that on the date and time of the incident, he 
and his co-accused, Danilo Tobias alias Kardong Kaliwa alias Danny 
Kulot, held up a man and a woman; that they did not get the watch of the
 man; that he held the victim's hands but the latter was able to free 
himself; that Danny Kulot stabbed the man; that when the victim ran, 
they also ran away; and that he did not know what happened to the victim
 (Exhs. D, D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4 and D-5, p. 90, rec.; pp. 27-31, tsn., 
Jan. 11, 1973)." (Brief, pp. 2-5.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Atty. Luis R. Feria, counsel de oficio of the appellant, states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "After a careful, considered and conscientious examination of the 
evidence adduced in the instant case, undersigned counsel is constrained
 to conclude that the findings of fact of the trial court, upholding the
 version of the prosecution as against that of the defense, must have to
 be sustained. As against the sole and uncorroborated testimony of 
appellant merely denying any participation in the commission of the 
crime imputed to him (while admitting that he was present at the scene 
of the crime), there is a formidable array of evidence against him 
consisting of the clear and convincing testimony of Remedios Maniti, who
 was in the company of the deceased at the time he was killed and an 
eyewitness to the entire incident; the extrajudicial written confession 
of defendant-appellant (Exhibit D) admitting participation in the 
commission of the crime; the testimony of Patrolman Arturo Rimorin who 
conducted the investigation of, and before whom Exhibit D was executed 
and signed by, defendant-appellant, as well as the testimony of Sgt. 
Geronimo de los Santos of the Pasay Police to whom defendant-appellant 
orally admitted that he held the victim's hands although he had no part 
in the actual stabbing of the deceased. </p>
  <p> "With respect to the testimony of the eye-witness Remedios Maniti,
 there is absolutely nothing in the record (except perhaps that she was 
the sweetheart of the deceased) to show, or even hint, that she had any 
reasons to perjure herself by falsely incriminating defendant-appellant 
in such a grievous crime, no bias, interest or prejudice against the 
latter as would move or induce her to faithlessly accuse him of a crime 
which he had not committed. More than ever, the time-honored, ruling of 
this Honorable Court, too elemental to require citations, that the 
findings of the trial court on the question of credibility of the 
witnesses, having had the advantage of observing their demeanor and 
manner of testifying, should not be disturbed in the absence of strong 
and cogent reasons therefor, applies fully to the case at bar. No such 
reasons can be found herein. </p>
  <p> "The same observations may be made with respect to the testimonies
 of Patrolman Rimorin and Sgt. de los Santos. Moreover, as has been held
 by this Honorable Court, where the prosecution witnesses, being 
government employees who testified as to what transpired in the 
performance of their duties, were neutral and disinterested and had no 
reason to falsely testify against the accused, and did not subject him 
to any violence, torture or bodily harm, their testimonies should be 
given more weight than that of the accused (P. v. Pereto, 21 SCRA 1469; 
P. v. Del Castillo, 25 SCRA 716.) </p>
  <p> "Then there is the extrajudicial confession of 
defendant-appellant, Exhibit D. True it is that, belatedly during the 
trial, appellant claimed that his answers appearing in Exhibit D were 
given because he was afraid as he was intimidated and struck on the 
buttock with a long piece of wood (pp. 32-34, t.s.n. Ses. of January 22,
 1973). It is submitted that this last-minute, desperate and 
uncorroborated claim falls flat in the face not only of the presumption 
of voluntariness in the execution of confession, but also of the 
testimony of Patrolman Rimorin to the effect that Exhibit D was executed
 voluntarily and that defendant-appellant was never maltreated (pp. 26, 
31-32, t.s.n. Ses. of January 11, 1973), and the latter's own admission 
that before he signed Exhibit D, its contents were first read to him in 
Tagalog and that he fully understood the same (pp. 24, t.s.n. Ses. of 
January 22, 1973), and his further admission that he has not filed any 
case against those who had allegedly maltreated him (p. 33, t.s.n. id.).
 Moreover, where the alleged confession reveals spontaneity of the 
declarations belying the claim that they were concocted or dictated by 
the police, the court will reject the claim that the confession was 
involuntary (P. v. Castro, 11 SCRA 699)." (Brief, pp. 3-5.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Notwithstanding the foregoing factual admission, Atty. Feria makes the following assignment of errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT OF THE 
SPECIAL COMPLEX CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE AS DEFINED AND PENALIZED 
UNDER ART. 294, PAR. 1, OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE.
  </p>
  <p> 2.  EVEN ASSUMING THAT THE CRIME COM­MITTED BY DEFENDANT-APPELLANT
 IS ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SENTENCING HIM TO 
SUFFER THE DEATH PENALTY. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We have scrutinized the record, particularly the testimonial evidence, 
and indeed there is no doubt that the appellant had a hand in the death 
of Crispulo Alega. There remains to be considered, however, the claims 
of the appellant which are made in the assignment of errors.
</p><p>
The appellant claims in his first assignment of error that he should not
 have been convicted of the special complex crime of robbery with 
homicide because the robbery was not consummated. He states that there 
was only an attempted robbery.
</p><p>
The Solicitor General states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x We are constrained to agree with defense' contention. The 
evidence adduced show that the appellant and his companion were 
unsuccessful in their criminal venture of divesting the victim of his 
wrist watch so as to constitute the consummated crime of robbery. 
Indeed, as adverted to earlier, when the victim expired, the 'Seiko' 
watch was still securely strapped to his wrist (p. 59, t.s.n., Jan. 11, 
1973). The killing of Crispulo Alega may be considered as merely 
incidental to and an offshoot of the plan to carry out the robbery, 
which however was not consummated because of the resistance offered by 
the deceased. Consequently, this case would properly come under the 
provision of Art. 297 of the Revised Penal Code which states that - </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 'When by reason or on occasion of an attempted or frustrated 
robbery a homicide is committed, the person guilty of such offenses 
shall be punished by <em>reclusion temporal </em>in its maximum period to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, unless the homicide committed shall deserve a higher penalty under the provisions of this Code.'" (Brief, pp. 5-6.) </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
In his second assignment of error the appellant claims that the 
information does not allege any aggravating circumstance nor was any 
proved during the trial.
</p><p>
Again the Solicitor General states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We likewise agree with the contention of counsel in his second 
assigned error that the evidence presented by the prosecution did not 
show the attendance of any aggravating circumstance in the commission of
 the crime and neither did the court a quo make any finding in this 
respect (pp. 7-8, appellant's brief)." (Id., p. 6.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The crime committed by the appellant is attempted robbery with homicide and the penalty prescribed by law is <em>reclusion temporal </em>in its maximum period to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
 Since there was no attendant mitigating nor aggravating circumstance, 
the penalty should be applied in its medium period, i.e. 18 years, 8 
months and 1 day to 20 years. The Indeterminate Sentence Law has also to
 be applied.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of the trial court is hereby modified; the 
appellant is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the special complex
 crime of attempted robbery with homicide and he is sentenced to suffer 
an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of <em>prision mayor</em> as minimum to 20 years of <em>reclusion temporal </em>as maximum, to indemnify the heirs of Crispulo Alega in the amount of P30,000.00, and to pay one-half of the costs.
SO ORDERED.
