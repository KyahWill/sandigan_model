COMMISSION ON AUDIT AND LEONARDO ESTELLA, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision of the Commission on Audit
(COA) in Administrative Case No. 81-525 for disgraceful and immoral conduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the sworn complaint of Editha Saligumba, the COA
instituted the administrative case against Leonardo Estella, Auditing Examiner
III, in the Auditor's Office of Misamis Occidental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charge was that the respondent raped
Editha Saligumba on several occasions.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1982</st1:date>,
the COA rendered a decision with the following judgment:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, for insufficiency of evidence, the instant charge
is hereby dropped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent is,
however, warned to comport himself henceforth in such a manner as would
forestall the filing of similar complaints in the future."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Editha Saligumba now wants <span class="GramE">Us</span> to review
the COA decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She insists that the
decision of the COA is contrary to the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus she raises these "vital
issues":</p>

<blockquote>"a).<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Was</span> the petitioner raped on three (3) occasions by
respondent Estella, with grave abuse of confidence?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"b) <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was petitioner
fabricating her charges against the respondent?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“c).<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is respondent Estella
the father of the child of the petitioner by his manuevers of amicable
settlement indicating his guilt?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“d).<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whose</span>
testimonies are more credible, that of petitioner or that of respondent Estella
including their witnesses?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“e).<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Is</span>
respondent Estella guilty of immorality and fit to be dismissed from service?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“f).<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the commission on
audit ignoring the evidence on record of the petitioner, because the investigating
lawyer who received the evidence in Oroquieta City, Philippines, the mother of
the in­vestigator, is the superior of respondent Estella's wife as a classroom
teacher?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition has to be dismissed for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Our power to review COA decisions refers to money matters and
not to administrative cases involving the discipline of its personnel.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Even assuming that We have jurisdiction to review decisions on
administrative matters as mentioned above, We can not do so on factual issues;
Our power to review is limited to legal issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the petition is dismissed.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style:italic">Makasiar, (Chairman), Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, De
Castro, <span style="font-style:normal">and</span> Escolin, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span>
