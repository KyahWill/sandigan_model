				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition Governor <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> seeks to stop respondent Manuel C. Domingo, Deputy
Ombudsman for <st1:place>Luzon</st1:place>, from conducting a preliminary
investigation of the charge against him of multiple <span class="GramE">murder</span>
in IBP Case No. OSP-88-01770, entitled "PC/INP/CIS vs. Governor <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span>," on the grounds
that:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. <span class="GramE">the</span> Ombudsman has no jurisdiction to
investigate the murder charge against the petitioner for its jurisdiction is
confined to the investigation only of acts or omissions that are connected with
the performance of his duties as governor; and<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">for</span>
the same reason, the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> (Special Prosecutor)
has no jurisdiction to prosecute the murder case against the petitioner.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon <span style="">receipt of the
petition, the Court issued a </span>temporary restraining order on <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1989</st1:date> (p. 49, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case began in the evening of <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1988</st1:date>, when Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span>
attended a basketball victory party in <span class="SpellE">Cabangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
party, he proceeded to a pre-wedding celebration in <span class="SpellE">Danacbunga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Botolan</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Zambales</span></span>.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>He left <span class="SpellE">Danacbunga</span>
at <st1:time minute="30" hour="1">1:30 A.M.</st1:time>, <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1988</st1:date>, on board his service car, and
accompanied by his security force of military/police/civilian escorts on board
two other motor vehicles.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> on the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> road a few kilometers from the venue of the
pre-wedding celebration, the convoy of three (3) motor vehicles, <span style="">with </span>the governor's car in the middle,
was allegedly ambushed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> jumped out of his car and took cover behind it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During a lull in the shooting, he was
allegedly rushed <span style="">home </span>by his
official staff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, he learned that
three supposed ambushers - Patrolman <span style="">A</span>lberto
<span class="SpellE">Dullas</span>, Jr., Don <span class="SpellE">Dullas</span>,
and Edgar <span class="SpellE">Vinco</span>, Jr. - were killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">His own</span> group
suffered no casualties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based, however, on the testimonies of eyewitnesses, the PC/INP/CIS
investigators reported that the Governor's group was not ambushed, but was the
ambusher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report stated:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"This case was prefaced by the report of Governor <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> that on the morning of <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1988</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, he and <span style="">his </span>escorts were ambushed by the group
of Pat. <span class="GramE">Alberto <span class="SpellE">Dullas</span>, Jr. along
the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="GramE">Provincial Road</span></st1:address></st1:street><span class="GramE"> of <span class="SpellE">Danacbunga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Botolan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in the course of the investigation, it was established, through
the testimonies of eyewitnesses, that it was the group of Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Dullas</span></span><span class="GramE">, Don <span class="SpellE">Dullas</span> and Edgar <span class="SpellE">Vinco</span>, Jr., then
riding in a Toyota Corolla car with Plate No.</span> CAG 419, who were ambushed
by the group of Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> and his escorts,
numbering more or less fifteen (<span class="GramE">15)</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Initial witnesses positively identified the
military/police escorts of Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> <span style="">as </span>CIC <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, CIC <span class="SpellE">Leonito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandala</span> PC, Cpl Cesar <span class="SpellE">Madoh</span> PC,
Cpl <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Manding</span> PC, Pat
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dolojan</span> INP and Pat <span class="SpellE">Florante</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dimaguibo</span> INP.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The above-named escorts were already charged of Multiple Murder before
the Regional Staff Judge Advocate (RSJA), Regional Command (RECOM) No. 3, on <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1988</st1:date>, pursuant to PD 1850.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said witnesses further identified the
civilian escorts/companions of Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> at the
time of the incident as <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Eto</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Epan</span>, Dennis Reyes, Arthur <span class="SpellE">Menes</span>
and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Detona</span>, et al., who were, likewise, charged
of the same offense before the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> on <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="5">May 6,
 1988</st1:date>, docketed under I.S. <span style="">No.
</span>88-100-1.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Follow-up investigation of this case further established the
identities of the other military/police escorts of Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span>
who were <span style="">also </span>implicated in the
said shooting incident, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat <span class="SpellE">Warlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>, Mario Dial, Jr., <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diomino</span>, Jr., <span class="SpellE">Sarito</span> <span class="SpellE">Dedicatoria</span>, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Deliquina</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, Alex
de Leon and Carlos <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, these personalities had already
been included <span style="">as </span>respondents in
the original complaint earlier filed with RSJA, <span class="SpellE">Recom</span>
3, on <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Relevantly, the testimonies of additional witnesses,
particularly those of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> <span class="GramE">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Dullas</span>
strongly inculpated Governor <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span>, when invited to give his version of the incident,
opted instead in submitting a nineteen (19) page photocopy <span style="">of </span>his letter dated <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1988</st1:date> to Justice Secretary <span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span> Ordonez." <span class="GramE">(pp. 63-64, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The military servicemen in the Governor's security force were
charged with murder in the Judge Advocate General's office, while his civilian
security men were investigated by the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Governor was charged with multiple <span class="GramE">murder</span> before the Special Prosecutor, Raul M. Gonzales, who,
without a referral from the Ombudsman, supposedly handpicked prosecutor Juan <span class="SpellE">Templonuevo</span> to conduct the preliminary investigation of the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 20, 1989, Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span>
filed a motion to dismiss the case on the grounds that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0.1in 0.6in 0.1in 0.8in;">1) The Office of the Special <span style="">Prosecutor </span>has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
case;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0.1in 0.6in 0.1in 0.8in;">2) The said office <span style="">is
</span>without authority to conduct the preliminary investigation of the case;

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0.1in 0.6in 0.1in 0.8in;">3) The preliminary investigation <span style="">of </span>Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> was prohibited by
law in view of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Elections scheduled on <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="3">28 March 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Albeit reluctantly, it may be imagined, Special Prosecutor
Gonzales referred the case to the Ombudsman for preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 19, 1989, respondent Manuel C. Domingo, Deputy Ombudsman
for Luzon, issued an order denying Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso's</span>
motion to dismiss because "the Constitution empowers the Ombudsman to
investigate any act or omission of any public official x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> without any qualification that said act or omission
must have been committed or incurred in relation to his office." <span class="GramE">(p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the denial of his motion for reconsideration, Governor <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
reiterating the grounds of his motion to dismiss.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After careful consideration, the Court finds the petition to be
without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sections 12 and 13, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution provide:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"SEC. 12.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Ombudsman and his deputies, as protectors
of the people, shall act promptly on complaints filed in any form or manner
against public officials or employees of the government, or any subdivision,
agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled
corporations, and shall, in appropriate cases, notify the complainants of the
action taken and the result thereof."</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"SEC. 13.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The office of the Ombudsman <span class="GramE">shall</span> have the following powers, functions, and duties:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 0in 0.6in 0.1in 0.3in;"><span class="GramE">(Underscoring supplied; pp. 9-10, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner admits that "the office of the Ombudsman was
created under the authority of the Constitution and was mandated to act as a
champion of the citizens, the watchdog of the people, the official <span style="">critic </span>of public officials and the
government <span class="SpellE">mobilizer</span>." <span class="GramE">(p. 9, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span> But he theorizes that "the framers of
our Constitution x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
intended to limit the powers of the Ombudsman to crimes related to or connected
with an official's discharge of his public functions." <span class="GramE">(p.
15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span> Hence, the lone issue presented by
the petition <span style="">is whether </span>or not
the Ombudsman has jurisdiction to investigate the charge of multiple <span class="GramE">murder</span> allegedly committed by the petitioner as provincial
governor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer is yes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>protector of the
people, the office of the Ombudsman has the power, function and duty "to
act promptly on complaints filed <span style="">in </span>any
form or manner against <span style="">public </span>officials"
(Sec. 12) and to "investigate x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> any act or omission of any public official <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>when such act or omission appears to be illegal,
unjust, improper or inefficient." <span class="GramE">(Sec. 13[1].)</span>
The Ombudsman is also empowered to "direct the officer concerned," in
this case the Special Prosecutor, "to take appropriate action against <span style="">a </span>public official x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> and to recommend his prosecution" (Sec.
13[3]).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The clause "any [illegal] act or omission of any public
official" is broad enough to embrace any crime committed by a public
official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law does not qualify the
nature of the illegal act or omission of the public official or employee that
the Ombudsman may investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does
not require that the act <span style="">or</span>
omission be related to, or be connected with, or arise from, the performance of
official duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the law does not
distinguish, neither should we.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for the creation of the Ombudsman in the 1987
Constitution and for the grant to it of broad investigative authority, is to
insulate said office from the long tentacles of officialdom that are able to
penetrate judges’ and fiscals’ offices, and others involved in the prosecution
of erring public officials, and through the exertion of official pressure and
influence, quash, delay, <span style="">or </span>dismiss
investigations into malfeasances and <span class="SpellE">misfeasances</span>
committed by public officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
deemed necessary, therefore, to create <span style="">a
special office to </span>investigate <u>all</u> criminal complaints against <span style="">public </span>officers regardless of whether
or not the acts or omissions complained of are related to or arise from the
performance of the duties of their office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Ombudsman Act makes perfectly clear that the jurisdiction of the
Ombudsman encompasses "<u>all</u> <u>kinds</u> <u>of</u> <u>malfeasance,</u>
<u>misfeasance,</u> <u>and</u> <u>non-<span class="SpellE">feasance</span></u>
that have been committed <u>by</u> <u>any</u> <u>officer</u> <u>or,</u> <u>employee</u>
as mentioned in Section 13 hereof, <u>during</u> <u>his</u> <u>tenure</u> of
office" <span style="">(Sec. </span><span style="">16, R.A. 6770).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>murder of
three persons is, without any doubt, an illegal act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since it w<span style="">as </span>allegedly committed by the petitioner as provincial governor
of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, the crime lies within the pale of the
Ombudsman's investigative authority.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Ombudsman Act of 1989 which took effect on <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1989</st1:date> (Sec. 15, R.A. 6770)
vests in the Ombudsman <u>primary</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> over cases cognizable
by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"SEC. 15.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Powers, Functions and
Duties.</span> - The Office of the Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions
and duties:</p>

<p class="2Q">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Investigate</u> <u>and</u>
<u>prosecute</u> on its own or on complaint by any person, <u>any</u> <u>act</u>
<u>or</u> <u>omission</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u> <u>public</u> <u>officer</u> or
employee, office or agency, <u>when</u> <u>such</u> <u>act</u> <u>or</u> <u>omission</u>
<u>appears</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>illegal,</u> unjust, improper or
inefficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It</u> <u>has</u> <u>primary</u>
<u>jurisdiction</u> <u>over</u> <u>cases</u> <u>cognizable</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Sandiganbayan</u></span> <u>and</u>, in the exercise of
this primary jurisdiction, <u>it</u> <u>may</u> <u>take</u> <u>over,</u> <u>at</u>
<u>any</u> <u>stage,</u> <u>from</u> <u>any</u> <u>investigatory</u> <u>agency</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Government,</u> <u>the</u> <u>investigation</u> <u>of</u> <u>such</u>
<u>cases</u>." <span class="GramE">(p. 74, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> has jurisdiction over
offenses committed by public officials when the penalty prescribed by law for
the offense is higher than <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> (Sec. 4, <span class="SpellE">subpar</span>.
<span class="GramE">(c), P.D. 1606).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The murder charge against the petitioner carries the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> in its maximum period to death (Art. 248, Revised Penal Code),
hence, it is cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, and the
Ombudsman has primary jurisdiction to investigate it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the labors of the constitutional commission that created
the Ombudsman as a special body to investigate erring public officials would be
wasted if its jurisdiction were confined to the investigation of minor and less
grave offenses arising from, or related to, the duties of public office, but
would exclude those grave and terrible crimes that spring from abuses of
official powers and prerogatives, <span style="">for
it is in the investigation of the latter where the need for </span>an <span style="">independent, fearless, </span>and <span style="">honest </span>investigative body, like the
Ombudsman, is greatest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the petition
