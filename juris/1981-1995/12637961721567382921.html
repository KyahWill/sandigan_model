<span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a>
convicting him of Murder and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify the heirs of the victim
in the amount of P30,000.00, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The People's Brief summarizes the evidence for the prosecution as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon of <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1983</st1:date>,
Francisco Gonzales, Jr., and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tanola</span>, both
farmers, left their farms situated adjacent each other in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Patag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Marcella, <span class="SpellE">Uson</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>
(pp. 3-5, 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="1">Jan. 23, 1984</st1:date>; p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1984</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On their way home to <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
Marcella, they saw at a distance of about twenty (20) meters from them and
about 150 meters away from their farms, appellant <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>
place his left arm on the shoulder of Marcos <span class="SpellE">Montemor</span>
and without ado stab the latter with a knife (<span class="SpellE">macheta</span>)
in the abdomen (pp. 3-5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Jan. 23, 1984; p. 3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, March 6, 1984).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a result thereof, <span class="SpellE">Montemor</span> fell face
downward (pp. 4, 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1984</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
soon as appellant <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span> had run away towards the
direction of the mountain, the two approached the victim <span class="SpellE">Montemor</span>
who immediately informed them that his assailant was Jose <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>
and the motive was jealousy (pp. 4, 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1984</st1:date>; p. 4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="1">Jan. 23, 1984</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they brought <span class="SpellE">Montemor</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Marcella about 15 meters from the place
of the incident (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, March 6, 1984).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From there, the victim was brought by <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Patutoy</span>, stepfather of
the victim, to the Provincial Hospital of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
where the victim died on arrival (p. 4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, January
23, 1984; pp. 2-4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, April 16, 1984).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The post-mortem examination on the body of the victim, Marcos <span class="SpellE">Montemor</span>, attributed the victim's death to "shock
secondary to hemorrhage secondary to stab wounds in the <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span>
region and lumbar region, posterior".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denies having had anything to do with the killing nor
even knowing the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only does
he claim that he was at home in Barrio Centro, six (6) <span class="SpellE">kms</span>.
away from Bo. Marcella, the scene of the crime, in the afternoon of the
incident, but more so that he could not have perpetrated the crime because he
suffers from an eye defect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To <span class="SpellE">capsulize</span> his defenses:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> On
March 9, 1983, at about 5:30 in the afternoon he was at their house in Centro, <span class="SpellE">Uson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, which was more
than six (6) kilometers away from <span class="SpellE">Bragy</span>. Marcella, <span class="SpellE">Uson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>; that in 1969, he
suffered an eye defect which blurred his vision, because of which, he could
only effectively move around when aided by his son <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span>;
that his wife had separated from him in 1968 and his companion at said house is
his son named <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span>; that on March 28, he was
summoned by the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain and was informed
that he was a suspect in the stabbing of one Marcos <span class="SpellE">Montemor</span>;
that he denied any participation in the alleged incident; that he does not even
know this person nor the witnesses who testified against him x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court gave no credence to the defense version and, as
heretofore stated, rendered a verdict of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellant faults the Trial Court:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"in convicting
the accused-appellant of the crime charged by relying heavily on the incredible
and inconsistent testimonies of the alleged eyewitnesses to the crime and in
totally disregarding the evidence;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"in convicting the
accused-appellant of the crime charged notwithstanding the insufficiency of the
evidence of the prosecution; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"in convicting
the accused-appellant of the crime of murder despite the fact that his guilt
was not duly proven by proof beyond reasonable doubt."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be conceded that prosecution witnesses Francisco
GONZALES and Francisco TANOLA categorically stated that they saw appellant
place his left arm on the shoulder of the victim and then stab the latter in
the abdomen with a knife (machete).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>TANOLA
declared that thereafter, appellant ran "very fast".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both witnesses maintain that they could not
have been mistaken as to the identity of appellant because it was still
daylight at 5 in the afternoon besides the fact that they were acquainted with appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>GONZALES had known appellant for about ten
(10) years, while TANOLA knew him for one year prior to the incident during
which time said witness used to see appellant frequently in Barrio Marcella at
nighttime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>TANOLA further testified that
he was told by the victim that the motive for the killing was jealousy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>GONZALES, for his part, declared that he did
not know the reason for the stabbing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the identification by prosecution witnesses,
however, the eye defect that appellant suffers from engenders doubt as to his
culpability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That such defect exists is
admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question is the nature and
the degree of that physical handicap <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
appellant's capability to commit the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness GONZALES would have us believe that it was
during daytime that appellant's vision was defective but that during nighttime
he could see clearly alleging that he used to see appellant always walking at
night.</p>

<p class="BODY">In evaluating appellant's defective vision, the Trial Court
"believe(d) that the accused could still see despite the eye defect to be
able to move around.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This the Court
could observe from the accused whenever in Court for his trial of this
case".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As against the foregoing declarations and observation, the prison
guard, <span class="SpellE">Honesto</span> <span class="SpellE">Almine</span>, who
had the opportunity to observe appellant daily during his incarceration from
March, 1983 to July, 1985 when he testified, declared that appellant had
blurred eyesight; that at a distance of two (2) meters he could not see
anymore; that there were times when appellant's cellmates would joke him but
they noticed that he could not identify persons around him; that he moved very
slowly because of his defective vision specially during nighttime, and that
although he could move by himself inside the cell, he would always have to be
escorted on the way to and from the capitol where the courthouse was situated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witness Manuel <span class="SpellE">Merdegia</span>, a
farmer, declared that he had known the accused for two (2) years already as
they were neighbors in Barrio Centro, their houses being only twenty (20)
meters distant; that appellant's eye defect blurs his vision during the day and
particularly at night; that he encounters difficulty in walking because of that
eye defect; and that if appellant goes at all to Barrio Marcella, it is only
when accompanied by his son.</p>

<p class="BODY">The son, <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>,
a 15-year-old Grade IV pupil, who lives with appellant in the same house
confirmed that his father, although not completely blind, suffers from blurred
vision because of which he usually accompanies his father in going from place
to place.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of reliable expert opinion, the Court finds it
difficult to determine the actual condition of appellant's vision and to
ascertain his guilt with judicial certainty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>GONZALES' testimony is that appellant can see better at night than
during the day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Diametrically opposite
is the testimonial evidence for the defense that appellant's vision is
defective both during the day and particularly at night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And while, perhaps, appellant could, indeed,
move around within the limited confines of the Courtroom as the Trial Court had
observed, no reliable determination was made as to the freedom with which he
could really maneuver about as to be able, despite defective vision, to stab a person,
chase him as he was running away and stab him again, and then flee "very
fast" as prosecution witness had narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another significant point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution attributes the motive for the killing to appellant's
jealousy of the victim whom appellant suspected of courting his (appellant's)
wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to witness Francisco
TANOLA, he was so told by the victim when he went to the latter's succor after
the stabbing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Patutoy</span>, the victim's step-father, also testified
that appellant had confided to him his feelings of animosity against the victim
so much so that he had warned his stepson to avoid appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further stated that appellant and his wife
"<span class="SpellE">Sina</span>" had already separated two weeks
prior to the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Witness GONZALES
also declared that appellant is married; that his wife lives with him and that
they are not separated; that he does not know the name of the wife but that he
would recognize her face.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, as <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span>, appellant's son
declared, his mother is <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacud</span>
(not "<span class="SpellE">Sina</span>") but that he does not have a
mother anymore and that since childhood he had not seen nor known her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's neighbor, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Merdegia</span>, also declared that since knowing appellant, he
had not seen the wife living with him nor visiting him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant himself averred that his wife went
away in 1968 and that he had not gotten married since.</p>

<p class="BODY">As between the testimonies of prosecution witnesses GONZALES and <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Patutoy</span>, the stepfather,
who were residing six (6) kilometers away from appellant, and the testimonies
of a son and a neighbor, the Court inclines to the latter testimonies as the
more reliable by reason of relationship and proximity of abode.</p>

<p class="BODY">We thus find that the foregoing considerations, taken together,
cast a pall of doubt on appellant's authorship of the crime and the alleged
motive for its commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
axiomatic that the prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence
and should not rely on the weakness of that of the defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, that degree of proof necessary to convince the Court with moral
certainty of appellant's culpability is direly wanting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And while appellate Courts normally accord
the highest respect to findings of credibility made by Trial Courts, we find
that the lower Court herein had <span class="SpellE">misappreciated</span> a
circumstance of weight and substance - appellant's admitted eye defect - as to
alter the result of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Oddly
enough, the Solicitor General, in recommending <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the guilty verdict, was <span class="SpellE">sepulchrally</span> silent on
this physical handicap of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> accused-appellant, Jose <span class="SpellE">Postrero</span>,
is hereby acquitted on reasonable doubt and is ordered released from further
custody unless held on other charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
