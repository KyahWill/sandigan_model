				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An Arbiter's carelessly drafted decision and the respondent
Commission’s undiscriminating acceptance and <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
thereof despite its self-contradictory terms, have unnecessarily given rise to
the <i>certiorari</i> proceedings at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1980</st1:date>,
Assistant Regional Director Dante <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span> approved
the application of LBC <span class="SpellE">Aircargo</span>, Inc. dated <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1980</st1:date> to terminate the
services of five employees in its <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Branch to
prevent further financial losses already being incurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The approval was based on a Summary
Investigative Report submitted on <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="7">July
 10, 1980</st1:date> by a member of the MOLE Special Task Force, who received
evidence on the application.</p>

<p class="BODY">The five employees (private respondents herein) moved for
reconsideration of <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla's</span> Order, contending that
there were serious errors in its findings of fact; that the financial
statements submitted by the applicant employer were inaccurate; and that as
employees, they were at a disadvantage in the proceedings since they had no
access to <span class="SpellE">LBC's</span> records and lacked financial means to
retain counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span>
referred the case to the Office of the Minister of Labor in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 26, 1984, Deputy Minister Vicente <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, Jr. issued an order: (1) setting aside <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla's</span> approval of <span class="SpellE">LBC's</span>
application for termination of the services of its five employees, there being,
in his view, factual and legal issues which had not been fully threshed out in
the original proceedings; and (2) remanding the case to the Arbitration Unit of
the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> District Office for compulsory
arbitration (as RAB-IV Case No. 0484-84).</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was assigned to Labor Arbiter Jose Aguirre, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing eventful transpired in the case over
the next two years, however; hearings appeared to have simply been reset, more
often than not at the instance of counsel for the employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In December, 1986, the case was re-assigned to Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Valaquio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1987</st1:date>, the employees’ counsel moved
that the case be deemed submitted for decision on the basis of the pleadings
already filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Valaquio</span> then rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> adverted
to the no little delay evidently caused by the employees’ counsel, which had
elicited a warning from the Arbiter that he would dismiss the case if the
employees failed to appear in June, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The decision pertinently reads as follows (italics, and parenthetical
insertions supplied):</p>

<blockquote>" * * *.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first
scheduled hearing was set February 22, 1985, however, counsel for <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> (employees) moved for resetting alleging among
others that he had not met some of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
since their whereabouts are unknown considering that this is a 1980 case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>On May 1985, this office issued an order
warning <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> (employees) to appear on June 1985
otherwise the instant case will be dismissed.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As things stand, the case is back to square one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If ever the case was indorsed, it was because
of the need of compulsory arbitration regarding some vital aspect of the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>In moving for resolution based on
the pleadings, one thing is clear, <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
(employees) do not wish to present additional evidence</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, we have no other
alternative but to dismiss the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, for failure to prosecute and/or lack of interest,
the instant case is hereby ordered dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>* * ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision is regrettably imprecise; its meaning is not,
however, entirely undiscoverable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It says, clearly enough, that (a) the employees had the burden of
presenting "additional evidence" to refute the facts found to exist
in the <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span> decision -- which facts had been
declared as adequate to authorize termination of the employees’ services on the
ground of retrenchment -- but (b) their counsel had procrastinated, and
finally, by moving to submit the case "for resolution based on the
pleadings," had made clear that the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
(employees) did “not wish to present (such) additional evidence." The
logical conclusions from these premises are (a) the employees’ forfeiture of
their right to so present additional evidence, and (b) the resulting failure to
establish any ground to modify the <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span> decision
(declaring that facts had been established justifying the employees’ separation
from the service).</p>

<p class="BODY">These were not the conclusions drawn, however.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Valaquio</span>
opted "to dismiss the case." <span class="SpellE">Valaquio</span> thus
uttered a paradox.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>While his decision
states that the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> (employees) had failed to
present evidence to prove erroneous the grant of their employer's application
to dismiss them, it orders the dismissal of the latter's application!</i> In
other words, the <span class="SpellE">Valaquio</span> decision penalizes the
applicant (employer) for the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>’ (employees')
failure to disprove the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> proofs, which had
been accepted and accorded due credit in the original decision of Assistant
Regional Director <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not unexpectedly, the employees soon tried to take advantage of
the ambiguity in the <span class="SpellE">Valaquio</span> decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>About a month after its promulgation, or on
March 27, 1987, the employees filed a motion opining that since the <span class="SpellE">Valaquio</span> directive <i>"to dismiss the case" </i>imported
the dismissal, not of their opposition to their employer's application to
terminate their services on the ground of financial losses, but of the
application itself; and since this, in turn, was an implicit pronouncement of
the lack of merit in the employer's claim, their reinstatement and the payment
to them of back wages should be decreed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was elevated to the NLRC which promulgated a decision
on <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1987</st1:date>
commanding the reinstatement of the employees with back wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It said, "With the dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">applicaton</span> to terminate the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>,
it necessarily follows that the ground relied upon by the applicant, <span class="GramE">which</span> is retrenchment to prevent further losses, was not
justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, in effect, will entitle
the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>." The ruling was explained further by the
NLRC in a Resolution denying the employer's motion for reconsideration, <i>viz</i>.:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" *</span>* (T)he
Labor Arbiter having dismissed the case for failure to prosecute or lack of
interest, he failed to thresh out the factual and legal issues ordained by
Deputy Minister <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failing in this, how can we resurrect the
grant of clearance already set aside by <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Leogardo</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being no
legal and factual basis for the grant of clearance, the consequence would be to
dismiss the case and reinstate the workers, as we have directed in our previous
decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It ordered, however, that the separation
pay already accepted by the employees should be deducted from the back wages
due to them from their employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">This decision of September 30, 1987, and the resolution dated
December 29, 1987 denying reconsideration thereof, are now subject of special
civil action of <i>certiorari</i> at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The error in the decision is palpable and the prejudice to the
petitioner, undeniable, as a review of the material facts at once discloses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner had applied for leave to terminate the employment
of the five respondents, avowing it was constrained to do so by financial
losses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It presented evidence in
substantiation of its application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence was found sufficient by the Regional Director who accordingly granted
the application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The employees
questioned the Director's findings, claiming they had been prevented by reasons
beyond their control from presenting evidence to refute the facts established
by their employer's proofs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Deputy
Labor Minister found merit in their plea and referred the case to a Labor
Arbiter for reception of the employees’ evidence on certain factual issues
which had not been fully threshed out in the original proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the purpose of this second hearing was
chiefly to accord the employees an opportunity to adduce evidence to overthrow
the factual foundations of the employer's application to dismiss them, which,
as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, had been pronounced meritorious by
the Regional Director, seems evident; and it was apparently so understood by
the Labor Arbiter and the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter, the employees’
lawyer failed to present evidence notwithstanding more than sufficient time and
opportunity granted to him by the Labor Arbiters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lawyer was in fact warned by the
Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The warning went unheeded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the lawyer submitted the case for
resolution without having presented any additional evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given these undisputed facts, demonstrating the employees’
unwillingness or inability, and ultimate omission, to present evidence, as they
were expected to, to controvert the claim of financial losses of their employer
(justifying their separation from employment), the indicated disposition could
not be more obvious:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>NOT the dismissal
of the employer's application for termination of employment of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> (employees), but the dismissal or overruling of
the latter's opposition and the waiver of their invoked right to ventilate the
factual and legal issues which, according to them, they had failed to deal with
in the original proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is in
this sense that the Arbiter's carelessly drafted decision dismissing "the
case" should therefore have been construed and considered by the
respondent Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It could not and
should not have been read as overthrowing the original <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span>
grant of the application to terminate employment, since no proof or argument
whatever had been presented to support such an overthrow, or to justify a
conclusion that the employer's evidence accepted in said <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span>
decision had somehow lost cogency.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lesson here, of course, is that judges and arbiters should
draw up their decisions and resolutions with due care, and make certain that
they truly and accurately reflect their conclusions and equally as importantly,
their final dispositions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out
in the opening paragraph of this opinion, the controversy could have been
resolved more quickly had there been more attention to the drafting of the
resolution following, and resulting from, the inability of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> (employees) to present additional evidence of
their contentions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it is, the controversy
has been unnecessarily prolonged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Wherefore</b>, the Court Resolved to NULLIFY AND SET ASIDE the
respondent Commission's Decision dated September 30, 1987, declaring said
Commission's interpretation of the <span class="SpellE">Valaquio</span> decision
and its reading of the relevant facts to be so seriously in error as to amount
to grave abuse of discretion, and to REAFFIRM AND UPHOLD the <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span> Decision dated July 15, 1980 which has not been
shown to be erroneous by evidence duly presented for the purpose.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style:italic">Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Griño-Aquino</span>,<span style="font-style:normal"> and</span> <span class="SpellE">Medialdea</span>, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span><span style="font-style:normal"> concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
