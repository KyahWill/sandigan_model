				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This case arose in 1979
from the affidavit-complaint for Grave Misconduct (Arbitrary Detention and
Slander by Deed) filed by private respondent Jessie <span class="SpellE">Teovisio</span>
against petitioner Pfc. Rogelio Castillo with the National Police Commission
(NAPOLCOM).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner was
accused of arresting without legal cause, on May 10, 1979, the private
respondent and two others, all waiters at the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tunay</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansit</span>
<span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Restaurant situated at <span class="SpellE">Timog</span>
Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; of </span>handcuffing, slapping,
and boxing on the chest the private respondent and forcing him and his two
fellow waiters into the police car; and of detaining them in the police
precinct for eight hours without charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner and his witnesses denied these imputations and
gave their version of the incident, as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>that on the above date, the petitioner, along with two other police
officers, went to the said restaurant, owned by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Estrelita</span>
del Rosario, to make a follow-up of her complaint for Qualified Theft and Oral
Defamation filed on May 4, 1979; that the petitioner merely invited the private
respondent and the two other waiters to go with him to the police station without
forcing them or placing any handcuffs on them; that the trio were released at
past eleven o'clock in the evening of the same day on the order of the inquest
fiscal to whom the case was duly referred.</p>

<p class="BODY">After conducting formal hearings, NAPOLCOM hearing officer
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Sanico</span> found the petitioner "probably
guilty" of a grave offense and consequently recommended his preventive
suspension from the service during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the administrative case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
petitioner was preventively suspended effective <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1979</st1:date> but was subsequently reinstated on <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1979</st1:date> by reason of
exigency of the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After reviewing
this report of the hearing officer, Adjudication Board No. 1 of the NAPOLCOM
rendered a decision dated October 21, 1980 finding the petitioner guilty of
Grave Misconduct (Arbitrary Detention and Illegal Arrest), and ordering his
suspension from the service without pay for ten months, with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>warning
that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>repetition
of the same or similar offense in the future will be dealt with severely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On petitioner's second motion for
reconsideration of this decision, his first motion having been denied, the
respondent board, for humanitarian considerations, lowered the penalty to five
months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed a third motion
for reconsideration; the same was likewise denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a last resort, the petitioner comes to us
by way of this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is immediately noticeable that this petition suffers from a
fatal defect in that nowhere does it raise a question of jurisdiction, which is
the only question involved in <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner does not allege, nor does he
set out to prove, that the respondent board acted without jurisdiction, or in
excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion in rendering the
questioned decision and resolutions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even on this basis alone, this petition compels a dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The errors alleged by the petitioner to have been committed by
the respondent board pertain mainly to its findings of fact based on its
appreciation of the evidence adduced by the opposing parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, however, a well-recognized principle
that findings of fact by an administrative board or officials, like the
respondent board, following a hearing, are binding and conclusive upon the
courts so long as they are supported by substantial evidence, even if not
overwhelming or preponderant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
reviewing court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cannot </span>substitute
its judgment for that of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the
administrative agency on the sufficiency of the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only where it clearly appears that there was
no proof before the administrative board reasonable enough to support its
conclusion would this court be justified in interfering with the board's
decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We hold that the findings
and conclusion of the respondent board are substantially supported by the
record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The petitioner, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">public officer, arrested without a warrant on
</span><st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 15.0pt">May 10, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">
the private respondent and his companions and detained them on the mere
suspicion that they had committed "qualified theft" and "oral
defamation" in February and April 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact, however, is that the illegal arrest was perpetrated after the
petitioner with two other policemen had taken their snacks and after talking to
the cashier of the restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that the petitioner and his two other policemen companions did not effect the
arrest immediately upon or soon after entering the restaurant strongly
indicates that the complained subsequent action of the policemen was to
accommodate or please the restaurant owner, a certain Mrs. del Rosario.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the intention to arrest complainant and those against whom Mrs. Del Rosario had
a complaint is also manifested by the prior agreement that policemen will go
the place on May 10th, according to respondent's witness, Trinidad de
Guzman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said Trinidad de Guzman
further testified that her aunt, the restaurant's owner, did not like the
existence of the labor union in her restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The President, Vice-President and Sergeant-at-Arms of the said newly
organized labor union happened to be complainant and his two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">companions, Rodolfo Ramirez and Israel <span class="SpellE">Boranque</span>, respectively.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Upon these findings, the respondent board correctly declared the
petitioner guilty of "illegal arrest" and "arbitrary detention"
constitutive of the offense of grave misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is immaterial that "illegal
arrest" was not one of the charges filed by the private respondent against
the petitioner, because the facts themselves, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">established by the evidence presented at the hearings, satisfactorily
proved the commission of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, proceedings before administrative bodies are governed by their
own rules of procedure which are to be construed liberally in order to effect the
just, speedy, and inexpensive settlement and disposition of disputes between
the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since from the start the
detention was without legal grounds, the arrest having been made without a
warrant, all subsequent proceedings were consequently tainted with illegality;
hence, the question as to how many hours may the police complete its
investigation and release the suspect under investigation without violating the
law is obviously irrelevant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, there is no sufficient showing of grave abuse of
discretion committed by the respondent board in rendering and issuing the
assailed decision and resolutions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Temporary Restraining Order issued on <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="4">April
 30, 1982</st1:date> is accordingly lifted, and the questioned decision and
