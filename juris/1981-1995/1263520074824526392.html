				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For determination in this case is the propriety of the lower
court's dismissal of the action of the <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
spouses on the ground that it is an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit
filed within one year from the date of last de­mand and, hence, it falls within
the exclusive original jurisdiction of the city court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> spouses, in their verified
complaint dated <u>February 16, 1981</u> in the Court of First Instance of
Manila, prayed that <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>
should vacate their lot in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, covered by
Torrens title in their names, remove his illegally constructed house thereon
and pay as reasonable compensation for the use of the lot P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">6<span class="GramE">,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">375</span></span></span>
from <u>January 1, 1974</u> to January 31, 1981 and P75 a month from February,
1981. A demand for that purpose was made by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">said </span>spouses in their counsel's letter of <u>November 8, 1980</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> in his answer alleged that he
had been staying on the lot <u>since 1951</u> when he leased it from <span class="SpellE">Fejosera</span> Investment, Inc. at fifteen pesos a month. He
constructed his house with the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> consent. He
pleaded that the court had no jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">After filing his answer, <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> moved
to dismiss the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">on </span>the ground
that it is either an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> or forcible
entry case and as it was filed within one year from the date of the demand to
vacate, the city court has jurisdiction over it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action on
the ground that it was not an <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>publiciana</u></span> but a case where the unlawful deprivation
is to be reckoned from the date of the last demand and, as the action was
brought within one year from that demand, it falls within the jurisdiction of
the city court. Cited were the rulings in <span class="SpellE">Calubayan</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, 128 Phil. 160, <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
Oh <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">vs.
Garcia, </span>L-29328 and L-29589, June 30, 1969, 28 SCRA 735 and Development Bank
of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>, L-29422, September
30, 1970, 35 SCRA 197.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court erred in dismissing the action. Its
purpose is to establish that the <span class="SpellE">Bernabes</span> have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span><u>better right than <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> to possess the land</u> notwithstanding that he had
occupied it since <u>1951</u> under an alleged lease contract with <span class="SpellE">Fejosera</span> Investment, Inc., from which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">the </span><span class="SpellE">Bernabes</span>
bought the land in <u>1973</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case is not a forcible entry case. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> misrepresented in his motion to dismiss that the <span class="SpellE">Bernebes</span> alleged in paragraph 3 of their complaint that he
"forcibly took possession of the land". There is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">no </span>such allegation in the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is neither a case of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
because <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> claims that he is occupying the lot as
the lessee of the <span class="SpellE">Bernabes</span>' predecessor-in-interest.
Necessarily, the court would have to resolve whether such lease <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>binding on the <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
vendees.</p>

<p class="BODY">"<span class="SpellE"><u>Accion</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span></u> <span class="SpellE">corresponde</span> al <span class="SpellE">que</span> <span class="SpellE">tiene</span> <span class="SpellE">derecho</span>

better right of possession. (1 <span class="SpellE">Enciclopedia</span> <span class="SpellE">Juridica</span> <span class="SpellE">Española</span>, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">450. </span>Bishop of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>

or <span class="SpellE"><u>plenaria</u></span><u> de <span class="SpellE">posesion</span></u>

one year</u> from the accrual of the cause of action or from the date the
lessee began to withhold unlawfully the possession of the realty. In such a
case, the Court of First Instance, now Regional Trial Court (not the inferior
court), would have jurisdiction. (<span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">vs. Marcos, </span>9 Phil. 618; <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">vs. </span>Santiago,

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Calubayan</u></span> case, cited by
the trial court, the purpose of the plaintiffs-owners in making the demand was
not really to eject the defendant but to facilitate arrangements for the
continuity of defendant squatter's possession of the land. The plaintiffs
wanted to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">recognized as </span>the
new owners of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Sy</u></span><u> Oh</u> and the <span class="SpellE"><u>Canonoy</u></span>
cases involve several demands to vacate made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">by </span>the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>. It was correctly ruled
that the one-year period should be computed from the last demand. Those cases
are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">distinguishable from </span>the
instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the practical standpoint, since <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>instant action for recovery of possession was filed on <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">February </span>19, 1981</u>, it would not be
expedient to ask the <span class="SpellE">Bernabes</span> to <span class="SpellE">refile</span>
it now in the city court which would be called <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">upon </span>to decide the questions as to the effect of the sale on the
alleged lease and on the house constructed by <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>
and his liability for the use and occupation of the lot since <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">January 1, 1974</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">. </span>Such questions could be more
competently resolved by the Regional Trial Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the lower court's order of dismissal is
reversed and set aside and it is directed to proceed with the case. No costs.</p>
