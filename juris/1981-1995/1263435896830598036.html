<p class="BODY">The factual findings of the Court of Appeals are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiffs and the defendant PNEI have conflicting
versions of the incident that resulted in a mishap which killed not only
Patricio Mamenta and caused physical injuries not only to Benjamin Tandoc but
also to several others who were passengers of the two (2) Pantranco buses that
figured in the accident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to the testimony of Benjamin Tandoc, in the afternoon of
April 23, 1985, he was riding in his Toyota car at the backseat thereof with
Jose Sison, while his son-in-law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Patricio
Mamenta was driving.  They had come from
Binalonan, Pangasinan and were cruising along the MacArthur Highway bound
towards the south.  While they were
negotiating a sharp curve in Bacag, Villasis, Pangasinan where no overtaking
was allowed, as shown by two (2) yellow parallel lines painted in the center of
the highway, a Pantranco bus bound northward for Baguio City overtook several
vehicles and was coming towards the Toyota car.  Tandoc told Mamenta to go to the shoulder of the road, seeing
that the Pantranco was running very fast and was about to collide with the
car.  However, before Mamenta </span>could
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">swerve towards the shoulder, the
Pantranco bus bumped the left front side of the car, which was pushed up
towards the shoulder.  At that moment
the car was also bumped from behind by another Pantranco bus which had been
following it, thus causing the car to be sandwiched between the two (2)
Pantranco buses.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>As a result of the impact, Mamenta died.  Tandoc lost consciousness, and when he regained it the following
morning, he was already at the Urdaneta Sacred Heart Hospital.  His left elbow was dislocated and he
sustained lacerated wounds in his left eyebrow, left eyelids, and left upper
lips.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Jose Sison corroborated the testimony of Tandoc on how the incident
happened, maintaining that the Pantranco bus had overtaken several vehicles
before its front left side hit the car at its left front portion.  He too lost consciousness and regained it at
the Urdaneta Emergency Hospital at about 6:00 P.M.  He suffered two (2) broken ribs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon the other hand, Pedro Duay, the driver of the Pantranco Bus
No. 1122 which had been following the Toyota car of Tandoc, testified that
while he was cruising the curved portion of MacArthur Highway at Bgy. Bacag,
the Toyota car overtook and passed his bus to a distance of about five (5)
meters and while the said car was still at the center lane of the highway going
towards Manila, an oncoming Pantranco Bus No. 1202 bumped the car, causing it
to be thrown towards the right side of the highway.  After the impact, Duay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">said,
the Pantranco Bus No. 1202 rammed his bus on the left front portion
thereof.  As a result of the incident he
suffered a fractured right leg and his left chin and jaw were also injured.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The conductor of bus No. 1122, Edgardo Cayanan, testified that when
the incident took place, he had his back turned towards the driver and he was
facing the rear part of the bus because he was then talking to two (2) women
passengers regarding student tickets, hence he did not see what actually
happened.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another witness, however, testified for the defense.  He was Leonardo Lopez, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Jr., a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">member of the INP in Paniqui, Tarlac, who
stated that at the time of the incident he and his family were riding in a
Mazda mini-bus going home to Tarlac from a beach resort in La Union.  He stated that the car tried to overtake but
did not make it and it was hit by a Pantranco bus going to Baguio City, while
another Pantranco bus also hit the car at its rear portion.  He took shots of the incident and then gave
them to an employee of the Pantranco.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Faced with these conflicting versions as to which vehicle actually
overtook vehicles in a no overtaking-zone, the lower court gave credence to the
version of the plaintiffs, which was supported by the findings of the policemen
who conducted an on the spot investigation of the incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pat. Renario B. Acosta of the Integrated National Police of
Villasis, Pangasinan, a police investigator since 1972, and the OIC of the
Investigation Section of the Villasis Police Station conducted an investigation
of the incident.  We quote pertinent
portions of the written report he submitted:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">‘2. Detailed
investigations revealed that the above-mentioned PANTRANCO with Body No. 1202
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">then in the process of overtaking
within the prohibitive zone, as shown by the double yellow line in the center
of the road, and without taking the necessary precaution to avoid damage to and

several vehicles ahead proceeding north direction and while in the process of
overtaking by taking the western lane of the Macarthur Highway, bumped and
sideswiped the oncoming Toyota Car hereto above mentioned.  After the impact, the said car turned on its
side and finally rested on the western side of the shoulder of the road facing
East direction.  The said PANTRANCO bus
with Body No. 1202 went further along the same lane intended for oncoming
vehicles coming from the North, again collided and bumped head-on another
PANTRANCO passenger bus with Body No. 1122 coming from the North proceeding
southward direction.  After the impact,
both PANTRANCO buses finally rested on the western shoulder of the highway,
wherein the rear portion of Bus No. 1122 was facing Northeast direction, while
the rear portion of Bus No. 1202 was facing Southeast direction both buses were
occupying the western portion of the Macarthur Highway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

coming from the north proceeding south direction.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Another policeman, Pat. Ruben Pituc, prepared a sketch at the scene
of the incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defense had tried to discredit the investigation report of Pat.
Acosta by presenting Police Major Romeo Bascos, then Station Commander of the
INP <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in
Villasis.  Major </span>Bascos testified
that upon knowing that a vehicular accident happened in Barangay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Bacag, he went to the scene where he saw
Patrolmen Acosta and Pituc still conducting their investigation.  He made a Spot Report to the effect that:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Investigation conducted dis­closed that both buses were bound
Manila and Baguio City, when the above-mentioned car tried to overtake bus
bound Manila.  At this juncture,
Pantraco (sic) bus bound Baguio City, while on its full speed, bumped said car
which resulted to their instant death and simultaneously collided with the
Manila bound bus which caused damages on both vehicle.'</p>

<blockquote>Major Bascos claimed that he based this report on the investigation
conducted by Pat. Abrenica and the information given by the residents of the
place.  He stated that Pat. Acosta was
not in charge of investigation while Pat. Pituc only prepared a sketch but was
not an investigator.  He informed the
court that his own investigation prevails over that of the others when there is
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>discrepancy.  He, however, confirmed that he agreed with
the sketch prepared by Pat. Pituc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We agree with the trial court when it gave more weight to the
findings of Pat. Acosta, 'it possessing the earmarks of truth and credibility
insofar as it stated how the incident actually happened'.  The court took note of the fact that Pat.
Acosta had been a police investigator for thirteen (13) years and was the chief
investigator of their police station; that his report <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>based on interviews with
plaintiff Tandoc, from residents near the place of the incident, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">especially one Arcadio Menor, who was in his
store some 40 to 50 meters away from the scene; and more importantly, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">own visual inspection of the damages sustained by the three (3)
vehicles involved in the incident.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, Maj. Bascos relied heavily for his Spot Report
on the version of a certain Pat. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Jose </span>Abrenica who was supposedly at the
scene at the time of the incident.  However, as the trial court stated, Pat. Abrenica was not presented as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a witness </span>and
it is doubted whether he was actually at the scene, since his name was never
mentioned in the testimonies of Patrolmen Acosta or Pituc or of the other
defense witnesses.  Furthermore, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>no
showing that Major Bascos is qualified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as a </span>traffic accident investigator.  The mere fact that he is a superior officer
of Pat. Acosta does not make his report more credible.  Moreover, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Major Bascos had to prepare his own separate report when, as he admitted, he

assessment of the legal fees; and there are actions or proceedings, involving

of the property or the amount of the demand is decisive of the trial court's
competence (aside from being the basis for fixing the corresponding docket
fees).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Where the action is purely for the recovery of money <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">or </span>damages,
the docket fees are assessed on the basis of the aggregate amount claimed,
exclusive only of interests and costs.  In this case, the complaint or similar pleading should, according to
Circular No. 7 of this Court, ‘specify the amount of damages being prayed for
not only in the body of the pleading but also in the prayer, and said damages
shall be considered in the assessment of the filing fees in any case.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Two situations may arise.  One is where the complaint or similar pleading sets out a claim purely
for money or damages and there is no precise statement of the amounts being
claimed.  In this event the rule is that
the pleading will 'not be accepted nor admitted, or shall otherwise be expunged
from the record.' In other words, the complaint or pleading may be dismissed,
or the claims as to which the amounts are unspecified may be expunged, although
as aforestated the Court may, on motion, permit amendment of the complaint and
payment of the fees provided the claim has not in the meantime become
time-barred.  The other is where the
pleading does specify the amount of every claim, but the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">fees paid are insufficient; and here again,
the rule now is that the court may allow a reasonable time for the p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">yment
of the prescribed fees, or the balance thereof, and upon such payment, the
defect is cured and the court may properly take cognizance of the action, unless
in the meantime prescription has set in and consequently barred the right of
action.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Where the action involves real property and a related claim for
damages as well, the legal fees shall be assessed on the basis of both (a) the
value of the property and (b) the total amount of the related damages
sought.  The Court acquires jurisdiction
over the action if the filing of the initiatory pleading is accompanied by the
payment of the requisite fees, or, if the fees are not paid at the time of the
filing of the pleading, as of the time of full payment of the fees within <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">such reasonable time as the court may grant,
unless, of course, prescription has set in in the meantime.  But where -- </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

15.0pt">in the case at bar -- the fees prescribed for an action involving real
property have been paid, but the amounts of certain of the related damages
(actual, moral and nominal) being demanded are unspecified, the action may not
be dismissed.  The Court undeniably has
jurisdiction over the action involving real property, acquiring it upon the
filing of the complaint or similar pleading and payment of the prescribed
fee.  And it is not divested of that
authority by the circumstance that it may not have acquired jurisdiction over
the accompanying claims for damages because of lack of specification
thereof.  What should be done is simply
to expunge those claims for damages as to which no amounts are stated, which is
what the respondent Court did, or allow, on motion, a reasonable time for the amendment
of the complaints so as to allege the precise amount of each item of damages
and accept payment of the requisite fees therefor within the relevant
prescriptive period."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that the Court of Appeals erred in
upholding the award of damages for loss of earning capacity of Benjamin Tandoc
in the amount of P300,000.00 is meritorious.  The only possible basis for such an award is the public respondent's
statement, culled from the decision of the trial court, that, per Tandoc's
testimony, he used to earn P3 million <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">annually
and that at the time of the accident, he was about to negotiate a P1.5 million
contract with Minister Hipolito which he was unable to get because he was by
then already disabled.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> However, Tandoc testified that his business

<p class="BODY">There is, however, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">no </span>merit

Article 2208 of the Civil Code allows their recovery in specific instances,
among which are:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, exemplary damages were awarded by the trial

respondents were compelled to incur <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">expenses
</span>to protect their interest.  Finally, considering the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">attendant
circumstances in this case, we are of the opinion that justice and equity
warrant the recovery of attorney's fees.  However, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

paragraph of the said Article 2208, "[i]n all cases, the attorney's fees

attorney's fees in the first cause of action (re claim of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Benjamin </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Mamenta) breaches the parameters of reasonableness.  It should be reduced to P25,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, the death
indemnity of P30,000.00 is increased to P50,000.00.</p>
