appropriated annually to cover the said unpaid subscription of the Government
in NPC's authorized capital stock.  And
significantly one of the sources of this annual appropriation of P200 million
is TAX MONEY accruing to the General Fund of the Government.  It does not stand to reason then that former

burden of the taxes previously paid to BIR, which they could shift to NPC if
NPC did not enjoy exemption from indirect taxes.  This means also, on the other hand, that the NPC may refuse to
pay that part of the "normal" purchase price of bunker fuel oil which
represents all or part of the taxes previously paid by the oil companies to
BIR.  If NPC nonetheless purchases such
oil from the oil companies -- because to do so may be more convenient and ultimately
less costly for NPC than NPC itself importing and hauling and storing the oil
from overseas -- NPC is entitled to be reimbursed by the BIR for that part of
the buying price of NPC which verifiably represents the tax already paid by the
oil company-vendor to the BIR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">"The reasons which support
this rule are twofold.  In the first
place, all the enactments of the same legislature on the general subject-matter
are to be regarded as parts of one uniform system.  Later statutes are considered as supplementary or complementary
to the earlier enactments.  In the
passage of each act, the legislative body must be supposed to have had in mind
and in contemplation the existing legislation on the same subject, and to have
shaped its new enactment with reference thereto.  Secondly, the rule derives support from the principle which
requires that the interpretation of a statute shall be such, if possible, as to
avoid any repugnancy or inconsistency between different enactments of the same
legislature.  To achieve this result, it
is necessary to consider all previous acts relating to the same matters, and to
construe the act in hand so as to avoid, as far as it may be possible, any
conflict between them.  Hence for
example, when the legislature has used a word in a statute in one sense and
with one meaning, and subsequently uses the same word in legislating on the
same subject matter, it will be understood as using the word in the same sense,
unless there is something in the context or in the nature of things to indicate
that it intended a different meaning thereby.  (Black on Interpretation of Laws, 2nd Ed., pp. 232-234) FRANCISCO,

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">For example, State <i>vs</i>. Bean
was an action by the State to recover for goods and services rendered an inmate
of a state hospital.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">The defendant was committed to the
Augusta State Hospital on September 21, 1949 by order of court after he had
been found not guilty of the commission of a crime by reason of insanity.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">The defendant was confined when the
prevailing laws were R.S. Ch. 27, Sec. 121 which provided that 'the person so
committed shall be there supported at his own expense, if he has sufficient
means; otherwise at the expense of the State,' and R.S. Ch. 27, Sec. 139 which
provided that 'The State may recover from the insane, if able, or from persons
legally liable for his support, the reasonable expenses of his support in
either insane hospital.' R.S. Ch. 27, Sec. 121, was expressly repealed by P.L.
1961, Ch. 304, Sec. 17 while R.S. Ch. 27, Sec. 139 was expressly repealed by
P.L. 1961, Ch. 304, Sec. 26.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">However, by P.L. 1961, Ch. 304,
Secs. 4 and 5, the legislature simultaneously enacted amendments which in the
case of Sec. 4 thereof charged the Department of Mental Health and Corrections
with the duty of determining the ability of the patient to pay for his support
and of establishing rates and fees therefor, and in the case of Sec. 5, it
provided that 'such fees charged shall be a debt of the patient or any person
legally liable for his support.'</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">It was only on January 20, 1960
that the hospital billed the defendant for his stay from September 21, 1949 in
the amount of $6651.72.  Plaintiff filed
on October 26, 1962 a case to recover said amount.  Defendant disclaimed liability by arguing that the enactment of
P.L. 1961, Ch. 304 was to terminate his liability for board and care furnished
prior to its enactment.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">The State of Maine's Supreme Judicial
Court rebuffed the defendant and held that:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">"[I]n the instant case P.L.
1961, Ch. 304 was intended to be a revision and condensation of the statutes
relating to the Department of Mental Health and Corrections by which the
substance of the right of the State of Maine to reimbursement for care and
support from the criminally insane in accordance with 'means' or 'ability' to
pay remained undisturbed.  We are
satisfied that it was the intention of the Legislature that there should be no
moment when the right to such reimbursement did not exist.  We think, the governing principle was well
stated in 50 Am. Jur. 559, Sec. 555;</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:.5in">'It is a general rule of law that
where a statute is repealed and all or some of its provisions are at the same
time re-enacted, the re-enactment is considered a reaffirmance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the old law, and a neutralization
of the repeal, so that the provisions of the repealed act which are thus
re-enacted continue in force without interruption, and all rights and
liabilities incurred thereunder are preserved and may be enforced. <i>Similarly,
the rule of construction applicable to acts which revise and consolidate other
acts is, that</i> when the revised and consolidated act re-enacts in the same
or substantially the same terms the provisions of the act or acts so revised
and consolidated, the revision and consolidation shall be taken to be a
continuation of the former act or acts, although the former act or acts may be
expressly repealed by the revised and consolidated act; and all rights and
liabilities under the former act or acts are preserved and may be enforced.'
