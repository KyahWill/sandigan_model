				A.M. No. R-299-MTJ, February 10, 1986</h4>
				<H3>ERNESTO G. MALFERRARI, COMPLAINANT, VS. THE HONORABLE GREGORIO PANTANOSAS, PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT OF CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, BRANCH II, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Judge Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Pantanosas</span> of the
Municipal Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>
City, is the respondent in this administrative case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the complainant Ernesto G. <span class="SpellE">Malferrari</span>, the judge should be "removed from office
by reason of his manifest bias and partiality which makes him incompetent to
properly perform the functions of his court."</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the complainant was the counsel in two <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases filed in the court presided by the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant expected the respondent to apply
the Rule on Summary Procedure in Special Cases which took effect on <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1983</st1:date> but the latter did not
for which reason the former filed a petition for <i>mandamus</i> before the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental on <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1984</st1:date> to compel application
of the rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1984</st1:date>,
the respondent issued an order stating that the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases were covered by the Rule on Summary ProÂ­cedure for which reason the <i>mandamus</i>
case was dismissed by the Regional Trial Court on <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1985</st1:date>,
when the instant complaint was filed, the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases had not yet been decided.</p>

<p class="BODY">The addendum to the complaint filed on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1985</st1:date>, states that the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases were decided on <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="2">February 19,
 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the decision the
respondent found the defendants to be in arrears in the payment of monthly
rentals the amount of which had not been specified by the parties and on the
basis of an aborted compromise agreement fixed the rentals at P1<span class="GramE">,300.00</span> a month but deducted from the amounts due to the
plaintiffs their back accounts to the defendants' restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision closed with the following
judgment:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the event that
defendants will fail to pay the unpaid rentals within the period of 30 days, to
immediately vacate the premises and returned the respective properties of
plaintiffs; to pay plaintiffs the reasonable amount of P2,000.00 representing
attorney's fees and to pay the cost of this suits."</p>

<p class="BODY">This decision will not touch on the merits of the decision in the
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases which may have been appealed by
either party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be confined to the
delay in their disposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent attributes the delay in the decision of the cases
to the filing of the <i>mandamus</i> case and the fact that he was on leave
from <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="2">February 4 to 8, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the respondent's explanation to be flimsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would have been no delay if he had
immediately ruled on the applicability of the Rule on Summary Procedure to the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Rule had been in effect since <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="8">August 1,
 1983</st1:date> and it was his obstinacy that compelled the complainant to go
to a higher court to make him do what he should have done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent's leave of absence is too
brief as to justify the delay of the resolution of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the respondent is hereby reprimanded and
admonished to be more conscientious in the performance of his duties.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
