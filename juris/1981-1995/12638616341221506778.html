was being sold at the public market, police lieutenant Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rentoy</span>, Officer-in-Charge of the Anti-Narcotics Unit,
together with patrolmen Rodolfo Imperial, Benjamin Navarro, Jr. and policewoman
Lorna Fernandez, decided to conduct a "buy-bust </span>operation" (p.

<span class="SpellE">promotographic</span> examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both tests proved that the confiscated stuff

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused denied having
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sold </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">marijuana cigarette to <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span>

14.0pt">from the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that
he was the victim of a frame-up by the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He testified that at around 7:30 o'clock in the evening of January 21,
1987, he was in the open patio </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
<span class="SpellE">Naga</span> City public market, waiting for his employer
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Agubang</span> to pay </span>him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his daily wage as a <span class="SpellE">carinderia</span>
helper, when Patrolman Navarro, in the company of some other policemen, arrived
and upon seeing him, called him to ask about the whereabouts of a certain
"<span class="SpellE">Kilas</span>." When he answered that he did not
know "<span class="SpellE">Kilas</span>" he was brought to the police
headquarters and placed inside the jail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They threatened to charge him with possession of marijuana if he refused
to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">tell </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">them the whereabouts of "<span class="SpellE">Kilas</span>," but they promised to set him free if he gave
them the information they wanted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
insisted that he did not know "<span class="SpellE">Kilas</span>." His
employer Ramon <span class="SpellE">Agubang</span> testified that when he
returned to his <span class="SpellE">carinderia</span> at around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="20"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">8:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, he learned that the accused, <span class="GramE">whom</span> he had not yet paid his wages had been apprehended by
the police and incarcerated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1988</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered judgment finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime charged and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>, to pay a fine of P20<span class="GramE">,000</span>,
and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused appealed to this Court, alleging that the lower court
failed to consider the following material facts:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
failure of the prosecution to rebut his testimony that he was the victim of a
frame-up by the arresting officers.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">2<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
The failure of the prosecution to present in court the alleged poseur-buyer <span class="SpellE">Amelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span> who was the
principal participant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>the
entrapment of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
the sale of marijuana allegedly took place in the patio of the public market in
full view of many persons and the apprehending officers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We find merit in the
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's guilt has not
been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, his denial of the charge of drug-pushing and his
allegation that he was framed by the policemen because he could not give them
information regarding a certain "<span class="SpellE">Kilas</span>" was
not rebutted by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
presumption that official duty had been regularly performed cannot prevail over
the Constitutional presumption of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">innocence
enjoyed </span>by an accused person particularly when the prosecution's
evidence is weak.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is unbelievable that the appellant would have sold marijuana
leaves openly in the patio of the public market, to a complete stranger like <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if he
was engaged in that business, it is improbable that he would have risked
getting caught <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and spending the </span>rest
of his life behind bars for the pittance of P20 supposedly <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
to him by <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the prosecution to present the supposed
poseur-buyer, <span class="SpellE">Amelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Catolico</span>,
was fatal to its case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without her
testimony identifying the accused as the supposed drug-pusher, there was no
proof that she bought and he sold the marijuana to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution failed to explain why it
could not present her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption
is that her evidence would have been adverse if produced (Rule 131, Sec. 5[e], <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> Fernando, 145
SCRA 151, this Court harked back to "the fundamental precept that the
prosecution carries the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused
beyond reasonable doubt for it is not incumbent upon the accused to disprove
his guilt." Hence, without the testimony of the poseur-buyer, the Court
found no convincing evidence pointing to the accused as having feloniously sold
and delivered the marijuana cigarettes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his brief for the People, recommended
the acquittal of appellant <span class="SpellE">Estillero</span> on the ground
that his guilt had not been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, as recommended, the judgment of the trial court
is reversed and set aside, and the accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Estillero</span>,
Jr. y <span class="SpellE">Abesa</span> is acquitted of the crime charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
