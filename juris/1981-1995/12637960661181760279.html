promulgated on May 4, 1983, refusing to quash the writ of execution issued by
the Regional Trial Court of Manila and to compel said court to give due course
to petitioner's appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case stemmed from a complaint filed in March 1979 before the

between plaintiff and defendant Guerrero for the construction of a 7-door
apartment, in which a performance bond was posted by <span class="SpellE">Philamgen</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his answer, Guerrero set up the defense
that the contract was not breached by him, but that <span class="SpellE">Casasola</span>
made substantial alterations in the plans, etc. <span class="SpellE">Philamgen</span>,
for its part, adopted the defense of Guerrero, and also filed a cross-claim
against him on the indemnity bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">A copy of the decision
was served on petitioner on October 28, 1981, and on November 25, 1981, or 28
days after, petitioner filed a motion </span>for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While said
motion was pending resolution, petitioner notified the court on March 31, 1982,
of a change of counsel from De Vera, Fernandez, Dino and <span class="SpellE">Cualteros</span>
to De Vera and Dino Law Office, whose address was Room 208, CMI Building, Ayala
Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="GramE">Metro</span>
Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On November 4, 1982, the
motion for reconsideration was denied, and on November 12, 1982, a copy of the
denial order was served on the law office of Fernandez, <span class="SpellE">Cualteros</span>
and Associates which continued to hold office at the old address.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said law office transmitted the order to
De Vera and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Dilno</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Law
Office, which received the same on November 15, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On November 16, 1982, a notice of appeal was
filed by De Vera and Dino Law Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
the same time, a motion for extension of time to file the record of appeal was
also filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Alleging that the appeal
from the trial court's decision was filed out of time, or two days late, the
plaintiff filed a motion for the execution of the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its opposition to the motion for
execution, the petitioner alleged that a mistake was committed by the typist in
copying the date November 12, 1982 which was the date of receipt stamped on the
denial order by the law office of Fernandez, <span class="SpellE">Cualteros</span>
and Associates, <span class="GramE">rather</span> than the date of its actual
receipt (i.e. November 15, 1982) by De Vera and Dino Law Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, finding the petitioner's
appeal late by two days, issued the writ of execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner filed a
petition with the Intermediate <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Appellate
</span>Court to quash the writ of execution and compel the trial court to
certify the appeal to the appellate court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petition, however, was dismissed by the Intermediate Appellate
Court, which relied </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
express statement in the notice of appeal that the denial order was received by
petitioner on November 12, 1982, which meant that the appeal was filed two days
late.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this
appeal.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">As a threshold issue,
private respondent questions the timeliness of the instant petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends that the petition </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">late by fourteen days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not
agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If a motion for reconsideration
is filed, the 15-day period within which to appeal the decision of the
Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals) to the Supreme Court </span>is
reckoned from the date the party who intends to appeal receives the order
denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In assailing the decision of the respondent Intermediate
Appellate Court, petitioner maintains that it was error for respondent court to
refuse to consider petitioner's evidence that the actual date of receipt by it
of the order denying the motion for reconsideration of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">lower </span>court's decision was November
15, 1982, not November 12, 1982, as mistakenly stated in the Notice of
Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Invoking Section 2 of Rule 129
of the Rules of Court, petitioner contends that a party is allowed to
contradict <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">an admission in its pleading
</span>if it is shown that the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was
made </span>through palpable mistake.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">We </span>find merit in
the petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the showing
that notice of the trial court's order denying petitioner's motion for
reconsideration was actually received by petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">on November </span>15, 1982, the fact that the order was sent to the
wrong address was apparently not considered by both the respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">appellate court and the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This controversy would not have arisen had
the trial court not been negligent in sending the order denying the motion for
reconsideration to the wrong address.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
</span>find it inequitable for the court to insist on the strict observance of
the rules, when it has itself failed to do <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In both his comment on
the petition and on his brief, </span>private respondent has made much of the
fact that petitioner has already admitted the finality of the decision from
which it is seeking to appeal, by filing with the Regional Trial Court of
Manila on April 13, 1983, a complaint for consignation (Civil Case No.
83-17029) whereby it deposited the amount of P244<span class="GramE">,715.00</span>
as settlement of its obligations under the decision of the court in Civil Case
No. 122920.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In effect, it would appear
that petitioner has impliedly abandoned its appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not however find it necessary or proper
to rule on this issue, especially since the records of the consignation case
are not before us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be more
expedient for the matter to be threshed out by the parties and adjudicated by
the Court of Appeals when the appeal of petitioner from the decision of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in Civil Case No. 122920 is given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered setting aside the
decision of respondent Intermediate Court of Appeals of May 4, 1983, and
ordering the Regional Trial Court of Manila to certify the appeal of petitioner
from the trial court's decision in Civil Case No. 122920 to the Court of
Appeals.</p>
