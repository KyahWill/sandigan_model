remote control of the <span class="SpellE">Betamax</span> machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such testimony of <span class="SpellE">Orig</span>
is not hearsay as <span class="SpellE">Orig</span> was personally present when
Pfc. Chua frisked the appellant and found the aforementioned articles in the
appellant's possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had personal
knowledge of the frisking and the items found on the appellant; therefore, his
testimony cannot be categorized as hearsay evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because the appellant was caught in possession of the stolen
property, he is presumed to be the taker in the absence of satisfactory <span style="">explanation </span>of his possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in accordance with Rule 131 Section 3
(j) of the Revised Rules on Evidence (Rule 131, Section 5 (j) of the Rules of
Court) which states:</p>

<blockquote>"That a person found in possession of a thing taken in the
doing of a recent wrongful <span style="">act </span>is
the taker and the doer of the whole act; otherwise, <span class="GramE">that
things</span> which a person possesses, or exercises acts of ownership over,
are owned by him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the appellant did not offer any explanation <span style="">as </span>to the
property found on him.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regards to the killing, although it is true that there was
no eyewitness to the actual killing of the victims, there are several
circumstances, which when pieced together will lead to a definite conclusion
that the appellant actually perpetrated the <span class="GramE">killing.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances pointing clearly to the
guilt of the appellant are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
prosecution witnesses placed the appellant at the scene of the crime; he,
himself, testified <span style="">that </span>he was
there, (2) Sanchez and <span class="SpellE">Orig</span>, saw the appellant with a
knife (3) Fernandez-Rivera stated that the appellant took out <span style="">a </span>bladed instrument, approached her
and Alicia and brandished the weapon at them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also saw the appellant lunge at Alicia (4) Silvestre saw Ricardo
Rivera already dead, saw the appellant holding a knife stained with blood and
saw that the appellant had bloodstains on the upper portion of his pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant admitted on cross-examination
that his pants were covered with blood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Silvestre also stated that the appellant admonished him not to touch
Alicia.</p>

<p class="BODY">Direct evidence of the appellant's participation in the actual
stabbing is not necessary when circumstantial evidence sufficiently establishes
that fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Santito</span>, Jr., G.R. No. 91628, August 22, 1991 citing People
v. <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, 167 SCRA 116, 122 [1988]) Circumstantial
evidence is sufficient for conviction if (1) there is more than one
circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven;
and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a
conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Rule 133, Section 4, Revised Rules on Evidence; formerly Rule 133,
Section 5, Rules of Court)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the
aforementioned requisites are present in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, the records show beyond reasonable doubt that
<span style="">the </span>appellant killed the three
victims and took the wristwatches and the remote control of the <span class="SpellE">Betamax</span> machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
facts, however, are not adequate <span style="">to </span>convict
the appellant of the crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain a conviction for this special
complex crime, the original criminal design of the culprit must be robbery and
the homicide is perpetrated with a view to the consummation of the robbery, by
reason or on the occasion of the robbery (People v. <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>,
170 SCRA 149, 162 [1989]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intent to
commit robbery must precede the taking of human life (People v. Luna, 58 SCRA
198, 208 [1974]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records must show
conclusively that the homicide was committed for the purpose of robbing the
victim because a mere presumption of such fact is not sufficient to sustain a
conviction for <span class="SpellE">robo</span> con <span class="SpellE">homicidio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a person is charged with robbery, the
intent to rob must be proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Lanseta</span>, 95 SCRA 166, 176
[1980]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the requisite criminal design to rob was not
duly proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no showing of the
appellant's intention, determined by his acts, prior to, contemporaneous with
and subsequent to the commission of the crime, to commit robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Guiapar</span>,
129 SCRA 539, 553 [1984]) The appellant's actuations do not show his intention
to commit robbery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant was a
friend of one of the victims, Ricardo Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What started as a drinking spree among friends ended in a killing spree
by the <span class="GramE">appellant.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant himself admitted that he was drunk and <span style="">under </span>the influence of drugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That robbery was his purpose does not appear
to be a logical deduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is more
logical to infer that the taking of the wristwatches was just an afterthought
by the appellant after he had killed his three victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To constitute robbery with homicide, there
should be a direct relation, an intimate connection between the robbery and <span style="">the </span>killing-whether the latter <span class="GramE">be</span> prior or subsequent to the former, <span style="">or </span>whether both crimes were committed
at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People
v. <span class="SpellE">Verdad</span>, 122 SCRA 239, 244 [1983] citing People v.
Hernandez, 46 Phil. 48 [1924]).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, the direct relation or intimate connection between
the robbery and the killing was not established.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, follow the rule laid down in <u><span style="">People v. <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>,
supra, </span></u>to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"We already had several occasions to hold that if the original
design was not to commit robbery but that the idea of taking the personal
property of another with intent to gain came to the mind of the offender after
the homicide only as an afterthought or as a minor incident in the homicide,
the criminal acts should be viewed as constituting two distinct offenses and
not as a single complex crime; the crimes would be either homicide or murder,
as the case may be, and theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>, et al., No.</span>
L-11844, November 29, 1960, 110 Phil. 1032; People v. <span class="SpellE">Elizaga</span>,
86 Phil. 364 [1950]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Glore</span>, 87 Phil. 739
[1950])"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Following this rule, the appellant is thus, convicted of three
(3) separate crimes of homicide and another offense of theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding that the information charged
the appellant with robbery with multiple homicide, it is <span style="">a </span>well settled rule that when two or
more offenses are charged in a single complaint or information, and the accused
fails to object before trial, the Court may convict the accused of as many
offenses as are charged and proved, and impose on him the penalty for each and
every one of them, setting out the findings of fact and law in each case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>,
<u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">) </span>As the allegations in the
information determine what offense is charged, the appellant may be convicted
of each homicide as alleged and proved and of theft as alleged and proved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each separate homicide and the crime of theft
have been proved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstances of dwelling and abuse of confidence
or obvious ungratefulness are appreciated in the killing of Ricardo
Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo Rivera was killed in his
own home (See People v. <span class="SpellE">Cuyo</span>, G.R. No. 76211, April
30, 1991) by the appellant who was a guest of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Lobetania</span>, 116 SCRA 297, 302, [1982]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the circumstance of intoxication, there is no doubt that
the appellant was drunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
alternative circumstance cannot be considered mitigating as the appellant,
aside from his self-serving testimony that he could not remember anything, has
failed to prove that the liquor he drank impaired his mental faculties and that
his drinking was not habitual or subsequent to the plan to commit the
felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Serenio</span>,
179 SCRA 379, 383 [1989])<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it
should be considered as an aggravating circumstance since it was admitted by
the appellant himself that he had been drinking liquor for a long time (TSN,
March 2, 1988, p. 7) and he took part in at least 10 drinking sessions held in
Ricardo Rivera's house (TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 5) <span style="">He </span>further stated that he tried to stop
drinking liquor but he went back to his old habit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 11) He was even
drinking after this <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1986</st1:date>
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 12)
Not only was the appellant drunk, but <span style="">he
</span>testified that it was <span style="">his </span>habit
to take prohibited drugs while drinking liquor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, March 2, 1988, p. 6) On the night in question, he admitted to have
taken <span style="">an </span>estimate of 15 pieces
of <span class="SpellE">bluemax</span> tablets and an undetermined amount of
"<span class="SpellE">exponie</span>" tablets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, March 2, 1988, pp. 13-14)</p>
