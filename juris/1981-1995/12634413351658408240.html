<p class="BODY">Accused Papias Jaba and Mario Carreon were not tried as they
remained at large.  Agustin Ortiz was

<p class="BODY">The prosecution established that on October 4, 1988,
accused-appellant Oscar Cobre, Agustin Ortiz, Papias Jaba, and Mario Carreon
had an altercation with their employer Renato Biteranta.  They were working in the orchard of
Biteranta and wanted to leave the farm.  They demanded payment of their wage for the entire month of October.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Biteranta refused to pay them since the month was not over.</p>

<p class="BODY">Biteranta's refusal triggered the crime at bench.  Jaba dashed towards Biteranta's house and he
was followed by Biteranta.  Before
Biteranta could reach the steps of his house, Jaba stopped him with a
kick.  Jaba then armed himself with a
.38 caliber pistol while Carreon and accused-appellant armed themselves with
shotguns.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fearful for his life, Biteranta tried to run away but Jaba had
poked his gun at him.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> Jaba
took Biteranta's wallet,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> shot

Accused-appellant then shot Biteranta with his shotgun.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Biteranta sprawled dead on the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the incident, Ortiz realized the presence of their
co-worker Renato Guzman, a godson of Biteranta.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Ortiz pushed Guzman into the house.  On
orders of accused-appellant, Ortiz tied the hands of Guzman, his wife Melitona
"Mely," and his three (3) year old <span style="">son </span>Ronnie.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Sensing danger to the life of Biteranta, Mely screamed "Huwag ninyong
patayin ang ninong.”<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Guzman then heard three (3) gun shots.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> He
surmised that accused-appellant, Carreon, and Jaba shot their ninong Biteranta.</p>

<p class="BODY">Somehow, Ortiz felt remorse in the killing of Biteranta.  He tried to help Guzman escape but Jaba
foiled his intent.  "Ting,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
ano ba yan," he shouted and simultaneously pointed his gun at Ortiz.  Ortiz shivered and continued to guard the
Guzman family.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before fleeing, accused-appellant and his cohorts saw to it that
they would not be pursued.  They
punctured the tires of the jeep and let loose the horses of Biteranta.  They fled with their guns and <span style="">bags to Manila taking a passenger jeepney
from Bugarin, Rizal to Divisoria.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An hour later, Guzman's wife untied him.  He found Biteranta's lifeless body near the
doorstep.  He immediately reported the
killing to Joe Presto and Floro delos Reyes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police authorities arrived and interrogated Guzman.  Upon ocular investigation, they discovered
that a sheet of the wooden flooring of Biteranta's room was opened, wide enough
to let one (1) person in.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> They
found that Biteranta's telescope, flashlight, and scissors used for pruning
"dalanghita" were missing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lt. Colonel Desiderio A. Moraleda, Chief Medico-Legal Officer of
the PC, Camp Crame, Quezon City certified that Biteranta sustained seven (7)
gunshot wounds in his head and trunk.  His death was caused by hemorrhagic shock as a result of shotgun wounds.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
He inferred that only one (1) gun was used because of the pellets' points of
entry.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense had a different account of the incident.  Accused-appellant denied having killed
Biteranta.  He testified that on that
fateful day he saw the dead body of Biteranta at the doorstep of his
house.  He turned his back and saw
Carreon who was also going to kill him.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> He
ran but was overpowered by Carreon who forced him to hold an empty gun<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
and to tie up spouses Guzman.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court on July 29, 1992 convicted accused-appellant of
the crime of Robbery with Homicide and imposed the penalty mentioned earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are the assigned errors.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ASSIGNMENT
OF ERRORS</span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN TOTALLY
DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE DESPITE THE DISCREPANCY IN THE
TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS GUZMAN AND STATE WITNESS ORTIZ.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING
ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION
TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Cobre insists that the prosecution failed to
establish that he was the one who shot Biteranta.  H<span style="">e </span>claims that it
was impossible for Ortiz and Guzman to witness the killing of Biteranta since
they were inside the latter's house when the shooting started.  He suggests that it was Jaba who <span style="">held the loaded .38 caliber pistol who shot
Biteranta to death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We reject the arguments of accused-appellant.  State witness Ortiz categorically testified
that from his vantage view he saw accused-appellant shoot Biteranta, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Papias
Jaba suddenly shot him followed by Oscar Cobre.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
do you mean by following?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:  Followed with one gun shot.  He
also shot Renato Biteranta.  Papias Jaba
was not able to hit Renato Biteranta.  It was Oscar Cobre who   was
able to shoot and hit Renato Biteranta.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will
you tell us what kind of a gun Oscar Cobre was holding at that time?  (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shotgun,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How many times did he fire his gun?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only once, sir.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you know if the shot that came from the gun
being held by Oscar Cobre hit Renato Biteranta?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
the armpit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
do you know?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was near the door.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
far were you?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two to three meters, sir."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The position of Ortiz near the door
allowed him to see the shooting even if he was inside the victim's house.  On the other hand, Guzman never claimed he
saw who shot the victim.  He was
hog-tied inside the victim's house and could not have a view of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attempt of accused-appellant to picture Jaba as the one who
shot the victim cannot succeed.  Jaba
had a .38 caliber pistol.  Dr. Desiderio
Moraleda testified that the wounds suffered by the deceased were inflicted by a
shotgun, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regard to the picture, will you please
examine the picture and tell in layman's language the significance?  (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
on the examination of the body, it showed 7 shotgun wounds on the right side of
chest and then . . . on the left side of the chest and this shotgun wound with
vital organ like the heart and the lungs.  (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr.
witness, of these 7 wounds which were mortal?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
the shotgun wounds caused the death of the victim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
these 7 shotgun wounds, in your opinion how many guns were used in inflicting
the injuries?  (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is only one shotgun used.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>  What is your basis?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
is area of the point of entry.”<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Moreover, accused-appellant will not be
acquitted even if he established that it was Jaba who shot the victim.  The evidence of the prosecution proved that
all the accused, including the appellant, conspired to commit the crime at
bench.  Considering the circumstance of
conspiracy, the act of one of the accused can be considered as the act of the
others involved in the conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a last ditch to absolve himself, accused-appellant avers that
Ortiz' testimony could have been exaggerated out of gratitude to the
prosecution for utilizing him as a state witness.  The argument is no more than a guesswork and deserves scant
attention.  We have verified Ortiz'
Sinumpaang Salaysay<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a> and
unwavering testimony taken one (1) year and eight (8) months thereafter, or on
August 8, 1990 and they jibed on material points - that they took Biteranta's
.38 caliber pistol and two (2) "de-sabog" guns from his room on
October 3, 1988; that Jaba took Biteranta's wallet and shot him but missed;
that accused-appellant pulled the trigger of his shotgun and hit Biteranta;
that they also took away Biteranta's telescope, flashlight, cutter, battery,
and some medicines; and <span style="">that they
deflated the tires of the jeep and unleashed the horses to make sure their
escape.  In fact, he was remorseful
during the slaying.  "Pasensya ka
na Kuya at Ate hindi ko akalain na papatayin nila si Kuya.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "Gusto ho akong kalagan noon,"
Guzman recounted.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only defense then of accused-appellant is denial.  Denial, like alibi, is inherently a weak
defense and cannot prevail over the positive and credible testimony of the prosecution
witnesses that the accused committed the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a> His
attempt to pass the blame to Jaba who allegedly shot the victim with a .38
caliber pistol cannot succeed.  His
story is uncorroborated and is contradicted by state witness Ortiz.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well-settled is the rule that when homicide is committed as a
consequence or on the occasion of the robbery, all those who took part as
principals in the robbery will also be held guilty as principals of the special
complex crime of robbery with homicide, although they did not actually take
part in the homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> The
exception to the rule is when it is clearly shown that they endeavored to
prevent the unlawful killing.  The
exception does not apply to accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is thus no doubt that accused-appellant has committed the
crime of Robbery with Homicide.  He was
correctly sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i><span style="">reclusion </span>perpetua.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
