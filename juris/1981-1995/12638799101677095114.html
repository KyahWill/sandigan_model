<p class="BODY">In the assailed decision, the Court of Appeals upheld the <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="3">7 March 1968</st1:date> decision of public
respondent Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources of <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="3">7 March 1965</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

in Mines Administrative Case No. V-266 declaring the fourteen (14) lode mineral
claims of Bernardo O. Valdez and associates (private respondents herein) valid
and existing and declaring the thirteen (13) lode mineral claims of herein
petitioner null and void and without effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts and proceedings which gave rise to the
petition are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in June 1959, private respondents filed a protest
against petitioner with the Bureau of Mines which was docketed as Mines
Administrative Case No. V-266.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
They allege therein that they are locators and claim-owners of fourteen (14)
lode mineral claims situated in the Res. Sec. "D", City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> (<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span> Reservation), which are properly marked and
identified on the ground and in their respective declarations of location filed
and registered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>accordance
with the Mining Act on 20 May 1959 at 1:18 P.M. in the Office of the Mining
Recorder of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, a day after Presidential
Proclamation No. 572, which released for mining purposes the area in question
from the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span>
Reservation, was concurred in by a resolution of the Congress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner subsequently filed on 21 May 1959
in the Office <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the Mining
Recorder of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City declarations of location of
thirteen (13) lode mineral claims, which conflict with and overlap the lode
mineral claims of private respondents; the conflict in, or overlapping between,
their claims was brought about by the subsequent filing by petitioner of its
declarations of location for the claims of the private respondents appearing in
their previously registered declarations of location and as actually marked on
the ground; the acts of petitioner are wrongful, prejudicial and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the rights of private respondents; and that
should the declarations of location and subsequent application for lease of
petitioner be given due course, the private respondents would sustain and incur
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to the protest dated 13 July 1959, petitioner made admissions and denials of
the allegations of the protest and, as affirmative defenses, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">averred</span> that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>by reason of its underground mining operations conducted before
and after the war on its claims immediately adjoining the area covered by
Proclamation No. 572, it discovered the existence of minerals within said area
and it then took the necessary steps to preserve its rights arising from such
discovery of minerals; it worked for and conducted the negotiations with the
Bureau of Mines, the Office of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, the Office of the President of the Philippines, and the Congress of the
Republic of the Philippines, for the release of the area subject of
Presidential Proclamation No. 572 for mining purposes; the release of the area
for mining purposes was made solely for its exclusive benefit; private
respondents never made any valid discovery of minerals or valid location of
mineral claims within the area embraced by Presidential Proclamation No. 572;
their alleged location of mineral claims and alleged registration of the
declarations of location of mineral claims within such area were effected
through deceit and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>fraud of
petitioner's rights; the conditions set out in Presidential Proclamation No.
572 made it impossible for private respondents to make a discovery of minerals
in and to mine the area covered by said Proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Home Investment Corporation filed a complaint in intervention
dated 7 March 1960<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

alleging therein that on 29 June 1959, private respondent Bernardo Valdez, in
his own behalf and on behalf of his associates, executed a Quitclaim wherein
they transferred, assigned and conveyed unto it fifty (50) percent of any and
all rights, title, claim and interest in and over the aforesaid 14 lode claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the Director of Mines rendered his decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1964" day="8" month="10">8 October 1964</st1:date>
wherein, on the basis of the following findings of facts:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence presented, there appears to be no question
that the area claimed by all the parties where they located and registered
mining claims was a part of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span> Reservation established under the Resolutions of
the then Philippine Commission dated January 25, 1907 and August 30, 1916.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being a part of a reservation which is
segregated from the mass of the public domain for a specific public purpose,
obviously the same is not open to mining entry and location except when
released <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> in accordance with the provisions
of Section 14 of Commonwealth Act No. 137, as amended, otherwise known as the
Mining Act, as amended, which read as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘SEC. 14.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- Lands within
reservation for purpose (sic) other than mining, which, after such reservation
is made, are found to be more valuable for their mineral contents than for the
purpose for which the reservation was made, may be withdrawn from such
reservations by the President with the concurrence of the Congress, and
thereupon such lands shall revert to the public domain and be subject to
disposition under the provisions of this Act.'</p>

<blockquote>Pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> section of
the Mining Act, and upon the request of the parties, the said area which
contains 101.5980 hectares was released from the said reservation under
Proclamation No. 572 signed by the President of the Philippines on April 8,
1959, and concurred in by the Congress on May 19, 1959, declaring the same open
to disposition under the provisions of the Mining Act, subject to the
conditions therein specified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence is clear that protestants and respondent alike located
their mining claims on the contested area before the same was released from the
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span>
Reservation, thus, from <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="5">May 2 to 20,
 1959</st1:date>, in the case of the protestants, and from <st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="5">May 9 to 20, 1959</st1:date>, in the case of respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These mining locations are, as admitted by
the parties, based on mineral discoveries made years before the requisite acts
of location have (sic) been performed, thus, on the part of the protestants,
outcrops of gold, silica, gypsum, etc. are declared by them to have been
discovered on July 15, 1957, and such discoveries made on later dates, by
virtue of the authority granted to them by the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City Council to search for valuable mineral deposits thereon and in line with
the declared policy of the said Council to have said area explored and
developed for mining purposes x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
while on the part of the respondent, its representatives discovered outcrops of
gold, silver, etc., as early as January, 1947, without permission taken from
the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City Council or any competent authority to
look for minerals thereon although at a later date (September 10, 1957), it
attempted to secure such permission from the Council aforesaid but its request
was denied as it appeared that the Council had already granted Bernardo O.
Valdez and associates authority to explore the same area applied for by said
respondent x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We observe from the evidence how the protestants and the
respondents tried to outwit each other in the registration of the declarations
of location of their respective <span class="SpellE">ming</span> claims, the
former having presented to the Mining Recorder for <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City their documents twice in the afternoon of May 20, 1959, and the latter
once in the same afternoon, but in all instances, said mining recorder refused
to register the documents in question for the reason that the area covered
thereby was not yet released for mining purposes from the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Townsite</span> Reservation, or that if the same was already
released for said purpose, he was not yet officially advised on the
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mining recorder was right in
denying the registration of the said documents for not only was he charged with
official knowledge of the fact that the area embraced within the mining claims
of both parties is a part of the said reservation, but that upon the fact of
the documents sought to be recorded, they refer to mineral claims, the areas of
each of which were applied for release from the reservation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, in the early morning of <st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1959</st1:date>, the representatives of
both parties were in the mining recorder’s Office to register the same
documents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This time, as the evidence
shows, said documents presented by both parties were accepted and registered
without priority or preference having been given in favor of anyone of them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is likewise observed that the protestants and the respondents as
well as the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> wanted to impress this Office
that each has been responsible in having the contested area released from the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span> Reservation for
mining purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is especially true
with respect to the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While we
find that the respondent may have been more aggressive in its effort to accomplish
the desired objective, yet it could not also be said that on its sole efforts
was the objective aforesaid for, to say so, to our mind, would not be fair to
the endeavors made by the other parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, over and above the said circumstances, it still remains in bold
relief from the evidence that both the protestants and the respondent located
their mining claims from <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="5">May 2-20, 1959</st1:date>,
for the protestants, and from <st1:date year="1959" day="9" month="5">May 9-20,
 1959</st1:date>, for the respondent, before the area embraced therein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>released from the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span> Reservation in
accordance with law. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>This being so, said
claims cannot be considered as having been validly located for said area was
not then open to mining location.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
the permission granted to the protestants by the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City Council to search for valuable mineral deposits in the area in question is
not an authority on their part to locate the register (sic) mining claims
thereon before the same is released from said reservation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The situation is more aggravated in the case
of the respondent (herein petitioner), for as pointed out by the evidence and
in spite of the said Council's denial to grant its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">request for permission, it entered said area to do mine prospecting
work, make mineral discoveries, and locate and register mining claims.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is well-settled in our jurisdiction that reservations are not
open to mining entry and location for the reason, among others, that such
reservations are segregated from the mass of the public domain for certain
specific public purpose and as such the same cannot be appropriated for another
purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, only mineral
lands of the public domain or mineral reserves open to mining location and
valuable minerals in private lands except coal, petroleum and other mineral
oils and gas which are governed by special laws, are free and open to exploration,
occupation, location and lease by qualified persons and entities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is an underlying rule on the basic
concept of mineral lands administration and disposition ordained by the Mining
Act. Sections 3 and 10 thereof are expressions of the rule aforesaid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Section 14 of said Act
provides that lands within reservations established for purposes other than
mining if found to be more valuable for their mineral contents than for the
purpose for which the reservation was made shall first be withdrawn from such
reservations by the President of the Philippines with the concurrence of
Congress before such lands and their valuable mineral <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">contents can be disposed of for mining purposes under the provisions of
said Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, is Section 28 which does
not allow prospecting ‘in a mineral reserve which has been closed to mining
locations, </span><u>and</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">reservations</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <u>established</u>
<u>for</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">other</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt"> <u>purposes</u>, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">except by the Government’.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still other sections of the same Act envisage
the same principle as they are parts of the whole fabric which form the basis
of the fundamental concept of mineral lands administration and disposition
stated above.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">From the foregoing, it is
clear that the lands on which the protestants and respondent staked and located
mining claims have not yet reverted to the public domain to be free and </span>open
to exploration, occupation, location and lease at the time the acts of staking
and location were performed by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, they have not acquired any right incident to such staking
and location.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, and
considering the other circumstances stated above, the mining claims registered
by them are void and of no effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Equity cannot be applied in this regard as the acts done by the parties
are <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of law and that no rights could be
considered born at the time and on the dates said acts were done.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">he concluded and ruled that "neither
the protestants nor the respondent, much less the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>,
can be given any right to hold and lease the area in conflict."</p>

<p class="BODY">All parties to the case, except the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Home Investment Corporation, appealed the aforesaid decision of the Director of
Mines to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was docketed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>DANR Case No. 2850 (<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 March 1965, then Secretary Fernando Lopez of the Department
of Agriculture and Natural Resources rendered his decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
on the appeal setting aside the decision of the Director of Mines and declaring
the fourteen (14) lode mineral claims of private respondents valid and existing,
while declaring the thirteen (13) lode mineral claims of petitioner null and
void and without effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support
thereof, the Secretary made the following disquisitions:</p>

<blockquote>"The records of this case show that the area wherein the
mining claims of <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>, et al. and
the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining Company had been located was
part of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span>
Reservation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the area was
released by Presidential Proclamation No. 572 and was concurred in by a
resolution of Congress adopted on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="5">May
 19, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the
declarations of mining location filed by appellants, <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>,
et al. located their claims from <st1:date year="1959" day="2" month="5">May
 2-20, 1959</st1:date> while the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining
Company located its claims from <st1:date year="1959" day="10" month="5">May
 10-20, 1959</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering these facts, although the locations of mining claims of
appellants were done largely at a time when the area was not yet released, the
locations were concluded or finished two days after the area was already
released for mining purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such being
the case, this Office is inclined to validate the locations of appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bearing in mind the time, efforts and money
spent by the locators, it is more just and equitable to consider the locations
of some importance rather than disregard them altogether which will serve no
purpose at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To declare the area open
for subsequent prospectors will be giving way to more conflict.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides to give a more liberal interpretation
of the provisions of the Mining <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Law on
locations, as in this particular case, would not prejudice anybody's right nor </span>would
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">it run counter to the interest of the
state.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Be this as it may, however, after declaring the mining locations of
appellants valid there is another issue that necessarily follows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This issue is the question of preferential
right among appellants herein which, as a matter of fact, is the same issue
raised when Bernardo Valdez, et al. filed their protest on June 21, 1959
against the thirteen (13) mining claims of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
Gold Mining Company resulting in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the protest of <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>,
et al. filed in the Bureau of Mines, they alleged preference (sic) right to
lease the area in question on the ground that the filing of the 13 declarations
of location by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining
Company was subsequent to the filing of their 14 mining locations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claims of protestants overlap and are in
conflict with those of respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Examining the declarations of location filed by protestants and
respondent in the Office of the Mining Recorder in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
it appears that the 14 declarations of locations filed by protestants were
received in the Office of the Mining Recorder at <st1:time minute="18" hour="13">1:18
 P.M.</st1:time>, <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1959</st1:date>,
which was duly stamped at the upper left hand margin of the declarations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the 13 mining declarations
of location filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining
Company were received at <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30 P.M.</st1:time>,
also on <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1959</st1:date>, in
the Office of the Mining Recorder of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said time and date was (sic) also duly
stamped on the upper left hand margin of the declarations filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These declarations of location, however, were
not immediately recorded or registered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All of them were recorded at the same time the following day <st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1959</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the foregoing, it is obvious that protestants <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>,
et al. have a prior right as against respondent <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
Gold Mining Company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 56 of the
Mining Act (C.A. No. 137) provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'All declarations of location, affidavits, power of attorney, and
all other documents or instruments in writing, regarding or affecting the
possession of mining claims or any right or title thereto, or interest therein,
shall be recorded by the mining recorder in the order in which they are filed
for record, and from and after such recording, all such documents or
instruments in writing shall constitute notice to all persons and to the whole
world of the contents of the same.'</p>

<blockquote>The declarations of location of <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>,
et al. should therefore be considered filed prior to those of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining Company and as the filing of the
declarations of location by <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>,
et al. was several hours ahead of the filing by <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
Gold Mining Company, the latter was bound to know of the previous claim of the
former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the subsequent
acceptance and registration of the declarations of location by <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining Company should be considered as of no
effect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining Company
contends that it has been instrumental in the release of the area in question
for mining purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Granting for the
sake of argument that this is true, the mining law gives no preference (sic)
right for efforts of this kind.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Office had observed that from the evidence on record, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining Company made its declarations of
locations based on its exploitation of its mining claims adjacent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to the area in question in 1947.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Company assumed that the vein of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">their </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

imposed in Proclamation No. 572, only the petitioner would be physically and
legally qualified to explore and later mine or extract ore from the area since
it alone would have access to mine and stake the claims in the area released
inasmuch as it has mining properties which adjoin the area in question and
where tunnels have been driven in different levels to follow up the rich
mineral veins which also go to the area in question; upon the other hand,
private respondents had no area to place a mill for the mining or extraction of
the ore below 600 feet from the surface because that area of 600 feet below the

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, petitioner's evidence established that the

purpose the mineral "discoveries" made in 1947.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not prepared to accept the claims of petitioner and
private respondents as to the period of time they located their mining claims
(May 9-20, 1959, in respect to petitioner, and May 2-20, 1959, in respect to
each of the private respondents).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since,
as asserted by petitioner, its discoveries of the minerals dated as far back as
1947 and, as asserted by private respondents in their case, as far back as
1957, by virtue of the authority granted to them by the City Council of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, and each group had claimed to have worked for the
release of the area from the reservation, it is logical to presume that they
also immediately performed all the requisite acts of location.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But both parties were fully aware that to
claim or admit the conduct of locations earlier than <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="5">20 May 1959</st1:date> would be fatal to their cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Were it otherwise, they could have simply
indicated much earlier dates considering that their "discoveries"
were made years back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was then
necessary, if not indispensable, that there be a showing that the locations
were completed after Congress passed the concurring resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not therefore surprising that both
petitioner and private respondents, without any prior agreement, were one in
designating <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="5"><u>20</u> <u>May</u> <u>1959</u></st1:date>
as the date of the completion or conclusion of the location -- just a day after
Congress enacted the resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
priority of registration was of utmost importance for a preferential right, <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="5">20 May 1959</st1:date> was the earliest
available date which must, nevertheless, be reflected as the end of the acts of
locations to give a semblance of truth to the claim that such acts continued
until said date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both rushed to the
Office of the Mining Recorder in the afternoon of that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They did not do so in the morning as the
entry of 20 May being the termination of the location would become obviously
suspect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the declarations
were submitted for filing in the morning, no reasonable mind can accept that
acts of locations were indeed done up to <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="5">20 May 1959</st1:date>, taking into account the requirements for the
completion of the declarations.</p>

<p class="BODY">As picturesquely described by the Director of Mines,
"protestants and the respondent tried to outwit each other in the
registration of the declarations of location of their respective mining
claims."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Stated <span class="SpellE">elsewise</span>, the good faith of both parties is
placed in serious doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion is inevitable that neither petitioner nor private
respondents made staking and locations of mining claims within the released area
after 19 May 1959 and that the declarations they registered were based on void
or invalid discoveries or locations since they took place before the release of
the subject area from the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span>
Reservation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither then acquired any
valid right over their respective mining claims and the registrations thereof
are invalid or void from the beginning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Apropos</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>this point, We cannot divine at the logic of both the Secretary
and the respondent Court of Appeals when, in furtherance of their postulations
that petitioner does not have a preferential right, they considered its failure
to locate its claim within thirty (30) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">days
</span>from discovery in 1947 as a waiver of its right thereto pursuant to
Section 33 of the Mining Law, and yet it did not apply the rigors of said
section to the private respondents who also claimed to have made discoveries in
1957 but made no location within thirty days thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both parties, having admitted that their
locations were made only in May of 1959, must equally suffer the same fate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources acted
without jurisdiction or gravely abused his discretion in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">validating</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>the locations of the petitioner and the private respondents
based on the following reasons:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Bearing in mind the time, efforts and money spent by the locators, it is more
just and equitable to consider the locations of some importance rather than
disregard them altogether which will serve no purpose at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To declare the area open for subsequent
prospectors will be giving way to more conflict.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides to give a more liberal interpretation
of the provisions of the Mining Law on locations, as in this particular case,
would not prejudice anybody's right nor would it run counter to the interest of
the state."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">He does not have any authority to validate acts clearly done in
violation of the Mining Act itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
there had been any intention on the part of the State to validate acts of
exploration and prospecting, discovery of mineral deposits and location of mining
claims within the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> <span class="SpellE">Townsite</span>
Reservation before the issuance of Proclamation No. 572, then <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>latter should have so expressly
provided.</p>

raised in this petition.</p>
