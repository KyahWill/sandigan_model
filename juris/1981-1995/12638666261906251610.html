<p class="BODY">The petitioner pleaded not guilty upon arraignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial on <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="5">May 27,
 1986</st1:date>, the prosecution presented Mercedes Tan, vice-president of the
complainant Association, as its witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She identifies certain exhibits, including a Consolidated Financial
Report dated <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1984</st1:date>
allegedly submitted by the petitioner to the Association.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The report showed that petitioner had
collected a total of P2<span class="GramE">,855,133.93</span> as occupancy fees
and association dues from members of the Association and disbursed
P1,915,719.50 from <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1982</st1:date>

leaving a balance of P939,414.43.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
issued three (3) checks to cover the balance, one of which, for P642<span class="GramE">,538.86</span>, bounced, and became the subject of <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 64758.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1986</st1:date>,
the trial court, upon request of the prosecution, issued a subpoena <span class="SpellE"><u>duces</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>tecum</u></span> and <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>testificandum</u></span> ordering the Manager of the <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> Banking Corporation, <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span>
Branch, to appear and testify on <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="6">June
 17, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Manager was

to <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The People and the Association alleged that
the account was opened by the Association and the petitioner was instructed to
deposit her collections therein.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Bank Manager did not come to court on <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution asked that a show-cause order be issued to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the prosecution called <span class="SpellE">Linel</span> Garcia Cuevas to testify that as a member of the
Association she paid her amortizations and association dues to the petitioner,
and to identify the receipts issued to her by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense objected to the presentation of
Cuevas because she was not the offended party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial Judge sustained the objection, ruling that "granting that
she (accused) received the money from the members and did not give the amount
to the Corporation, it should be the individual members who will file the
necessary complaint, not the corporation." <span class="GramE">(p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Memoranda were submitted by both sides.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial was reset.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
the prosecution's behest, another subpoena was served on the Bank Manager to
bring the records of Current Account No. 32-00066-9 for the hearing on July 29,
1986, but he again failed to appear in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution manifested that it had a ready witness and other
evidence besides.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the court
reset the trial because the prosecution's motion for reconsideration of the
court's order sustaining the defenseâ€™ objection to Cuevas' testimony was still
unresolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1986</st1:date>,
the prosecution received a copy of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
"Motion to Consider the Prosecution to Have Rested Its Case and to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> the Case for Insufficiency of Evidence." The
prosecution promptly opposed it.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the motion to dismiss, the <span class="GramE">prosecution
informed the court that it had other witnesses to present and that it would
file a petition for <i>certiorari</i> should the trial court deny</span> its
pending motion for reconsideration of the order disallowing Cuevas, and other
association members from testifying.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1986</st1:date>,
the court denied the prosecution's motion for reconsideration of the order
barring Cuevas and other members of the Association from testifying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court also terminated the presentation of
further evidence for the prosecution and dismissed the information for
insufficiency of evidence.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The People elevated the case to the Court of Appeals on a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> (CA-G.R. SP No. 10227).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals granted the petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of its decision reads
as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, the questioned order of the respondent Judge dated
<st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1986</st1:date> is hereby
ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Criminal Case
No. 64758 is REINSTATED and the respondent Judge is DIRECTED to allow the
petitioners to proceed with the further presentation of their evidence
including but not limited to the testimony of members/homeowners of the
complainant Association regarding payments made by them to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the private
respondent."</span> <span class="GramE">(p. 44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner seeks a review of that decision alleging that the
Court of Appeals:</p>

<p class="2Q">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>failed to
"capture" the facts and the issues involved;</p>

<p class="2Q">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>erred in stating that it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>immaterial whether it was the
Association (as a corporate entity) or its members who suffered the damage and
prejudice, and consequently erred in ordering the presentation of evidence on a
matter<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> not </span>alleged in the
information;</p>

<p class="2Q">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">erred</span>
in granting the petition for <i>certiorari</i> despite the failure of the
prosecution to file a motion for reconsideration of the questioned order of
dismissal of <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1986</st1:date>
of the trial court; and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">erred</span>
in ordering the reopening of the case, violating the rule on double jeopardy.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition has no merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">etitioner's insinuation </span>that
the Court of Appeals did not "capture" or comprehend the facts and
issues in this case is officious and impertinent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for the defense's objection to the presentation of
Cuevas as a prosecution witness was "its assumption that she would be
presented to testify as the party damaged or prejudiced." <span class="GramE">(p. 2, Petition, p. 14, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That assumption was baseless for the
prosecution had clearly manifested that Cuevas would "prove that she is
one of the members of the association who paid amortizations and association
dues to the accused and also to identify receipts which bear the signature of
the accused." <span class="GramE">(p. 4, TSN, June 17, 1986, cited on p. 7
of the Petition.)</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The error of
the trial court's theory that even if Cuevas testified, she would be unable to
prove that damage or prejudice was suffered by the Association was pointed out
by the Court of Appeals as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Whether the Association is prejudiced by the acts of the
accused can be resolved only if the prosecution is allowed to present the
members/homeowners as witnesses and the official receipts as evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuredly the Association stands to suffer if
it can no longer collect the amortization and association dues from
members/homeowners who have already paid the same to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the testimony of the members/homeowners is
not admitted, how can the Association prove that the accused received the money
in its behalf?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How can it prove that the
accused was able to collect from the members/homeowners because they recognized
her as collecting officer or agent of the Association?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the receipts are not admitted, how can the
Association prove that the accused received payments in its behalf?" <span class="GramE">(p. 43, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">As the offended party, the <span class="GramE">Association,</span> is an artificial person, the only way it can
"testify" on the damage and prejudice that it suffered is through the
testimony of its members.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, it was established that petitioner was employed by
the Association as its <span class="GramE">collector,</span> hence, she occupied
a fiduciary position in relation to the Association.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The By-Laws or Executive Order No. 535 did
not prohibit her appointment as such by the Association subject to the
Treasurer's direction and control.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">People vs. Yu <span class="SpellE">Chai</span>
Ho, 53 Phil. 874, is</span> still sound doctrine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law is clear that "another"
(hence, not necessarily the owner of the money or goods misappropriated) should
have been prejudiced by the breach of trust committed by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The onus of the offense is the infidelity of
the accused to his trust by which another suffers damage or prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's failure to file a motion for reconsideration in
the trial court before commencing <i>certiorari</i> proceedings in the Court of
Appeals, was not fatal to the petition for this rule does not apply "where
the proceeding in which the error occurred is a patent nullity," or
"where the deprivation of petitioner's fundamental right to due process
taints the proceedings against him in the court below not only with
irregularity but nullity," or "when special circumstances warrant
immediate and more direct action" (<span class="SpellE">Matute</span> vs.
CA, 26 SCRA 768).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the prosecution
was deprived of due process, the case is an exception <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to </span>the rule requiring a previous motion for reconsideration
before a petition for <i>certiorari</i> may be filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of the Court of Appeals reinstating the criminal case
for further hearing by the tria<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">l</span>
court does not violate the rule on double jeopardy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the elements of double jeopardy is a
competent court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">trial </span>court in this case was ousted
from its jurisdiction when it violated the right of the prosecution to due
process by aborting its right to complete the presentation of its
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the first jeopardy had
not been terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remand of the
case for further hearing or trial is merely a continuation of the first
jeopardy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not expose the accused
to a second jeopardy (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>, 138 SCRA
166).</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Bocar</u></span>, <span class="GramE">an
information</span> for theft was filed against the three accused therein who,
upon arraignment, pleaded "not guilty." Respondent Judge conducted a
"summary investigation" questioning the complainant and the accused,
after which he issued an order dismissing the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon a special civil action seeking
the annulment of said order, this Court found that the prosecution was denied
due process as it never had the chance to offer its evidence formally in
accordance with the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
setting aside the order of dismissal and remanding the case for trial on the merits,
this Court held:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">"Where the prosecution is deprived of a fair opportunity to
prosecute and prove its case, its right to due process is thereby violated (<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Genato</span>, L-37399, 57 SCRA
123<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[May 29, 1974]; <span class="SpellE">Serino</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>, L-33116, 40 SCRA 433 [Aug. 31, 1971];
People vs. Gomez, L-22345, 20 SCRA 293 [May 29, 1967]; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Balisacan</span>, L-26376, 17 SCRA 1119 [Aug. 31, 1966]).</p>

<p class="3Q">â€œThe cardinal precept is that where there is a violation of basic
constitutional rights, courts are ousted of their jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the violation of the State's right to
due process raises a serious jurisdictional issue (<span class="SpellE">Gumabon</span>
vs. Director of the Bureau of Prisons, L-30026, 37 SCRA 420 [Jan. 30, 1971])
which cannot be glossed over or disregarded at will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the denial of the fundamental right of
due process is apparent, a decision rendered in disregard of that right is void
for lack of jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Aducayen</span> vs. Flores,
L-30370, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">[May </span>25, 1973] 51 SCRA
78; Shell Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Enage</span>, L-30111-12, 49 SCRA 416
[Feb. 27, 1973]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any judgment or
decision rendered notwithstanding such violation may be regarded as a 'lawless
thing, which can be treated as an outlaw and slain at sight, or ignored
wherever it exhibits its head' (<span class="SpellE">Aducayen</span> vs. Flores, <u style="text-underline:words">supra</u>).</p>

<p class="3Q">"Respondent Judge's dismissal order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1967</st1:date> being null and void for lack of
jurisdiction, the same does not constitute a proper basis for a claim of double
jeopardy (<span class="SpellE">Serino</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>, <u style="text-underline:words">supra</u>).</p>

<p class="3Q">"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> <span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">"Thus, apparently, to raise the defense of double jeopardy,
three <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">requisites </span>must be
present:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) a first jeopardy must have
attached prior to the second; (2) the first jeopardy must have been validly
terminated; and (3) the second jeopardy must be for the same offense as that in
the first.</p>

<p class="3Q">"Legal jeopardy attaches only (a) upon a valid indictment, (b)
before a competent court, (c) after arraignment, (d) a valid plea having been
entered; and (e) the case was dismissed or otherwise terminated without the
express consent of the accused (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ylagan</span>, 58
Phil. 851).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lower court was not
competent as it was ousted of its jurisdiction when it violated the right of
the prosecution to due process.</p>

<p class="3Q">"In effect, the first jeopardy was never terminated, and the
remand of the criminal case for further hearing and/or trial before the lower
courts amounts merely to a continuation of the first jeopardy, and does not
expose the accused to a second jeopardy." (<span class="GramE">at</span> pp.
