<p class="BODY">The trial court summarized the conflicting versions of the
prosecution and the defense as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The prosecution, based mainly on the testimonies of the
complainant, Mercy Amor Magallanes, and her mother, Flora Magallanes put
forward the following version:</p>

<p class="3Q">‘On 19 June 1989, at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening, while
walking along A.B. Fernandez Avenue on her way home from the house of her
friend, Mercy Amor Magallanes was forcibly taken at gun point by accused
Ernesto Corpuz with the use of a motorized tricycle.  Afraid that accused might kill her, the complainant boarded the
tricycle and was brought by the accused to a secluded place in San Miguel,
Calasiao, Pangasinan.  There, the
accused started kissing her, totally undressed her and with continuous threats,
ordered her to sit down with her legs spread on the motorcycle's seat, and then
and there succeeded in unleashing his bestial lust in sexually abusing his
victim in that position.  Having
satisfied his lust, accused allowed the complainant to put on her dress and
thereafter brought her back to Dagupan City and after giving her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">P10.00, </span>accused ordered her to go
home.  She refused to divulge the matter
to her parents because her ravisher threatened to kill her if she will do so,
until two days later <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">or </span>on 21
June 1989, when her mother learned of such unfortunate incident through a
neighbor.’</p>

<p class="2Q">The prosecution, to further bolster its claim presented three (3)
other witnesses:  Jose Mejia, the
Barangay Captain of Pantal District, Dagupan City; Cpl. Anacleto Andaya, a
member of Dagupan City Police Station and the assigned desk officer and Dr.
Rico Reyes, the examining physician, whose testimonies consist mainly:</p>

<p class="3Q">'That on 21 June 1989, Mercy Amor Magallanes together with her
parents reported the incident to the Barangay Captain who immediately summoned
Ernesto Corpuz, the alleged rapist.  Said accused while admitting that he had sexual intercourse with the
complainant, he denied that the same was without her consent as she voluntarily
went with him to Calasiao, Pangasinan.</p>

<p class="3Q">On same date, the complainants now with the Barangay Captain
proceeded to the Police Station where they had their complaint recorded in the
Police Blotter.  Thereafter, the
complainant was brought to the Gov. Teofilo Sison Provincial Hospital for
examination, for which a Medico-Legal Certificate was issued by the examining
physician.'</p>

<p class="2Q">For its part, the defense presented only one (1) witness (sic),
accused Ernesto Corpuz.  The version
posited by the defense is that:</p>

<p class="3Q">‘At about five o'clock in the afternoon of 19 June 1989,
complainant Mercy Amor Magallanes voluntarily rode with the accused in his
tricycle, taking the back seat, and went with him to all the places where he
brought his passengers.</p>

<p class="3Q">Came half past eight in the evening, accused still with the
complainant at his back seat brought a passenger to Calasiao, Pangasinan, who
promised to pay a fare of P10<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">.00.  </span>After said passenger alighted, the
two proceeded to Barangay Balani, also in Calasiao, where accused made his
proposal to complainant to have sex with him.  The complainant voluntarily accepted such proposal and with full consent
had sexual intercourse with him.  Thereafter, they both went back to Dagupan City where complainant stayed
with the accused in taking other passengers until 9 o'clock of the same evening
when she decided to go home after having received P50.00 from the accused.  Defense further advanced the theory that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">complainant was </span>accused's paramour on
account of his giving money to her for at least ten times from the month of
April to June 1989.’”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave its imprimatur to the prosecution's version
because (a) it is "hard to believe" that the offended party, as
claimed by the accused-appellant, voluntarily went with him in the evening of
19 June 1989 as "[t]here is no iota of proof that accused and complainant
were having some kind of special relationship prior to the incident"; his
claim that he had amorous relations with her is not supported by any evidence;
(b) his claim that she had been receiving money from him on several occasions
"is intriguing, if not inherently improbable"; (c) the victim
"openly declared that she was raped" and jurisprudence is settled
that "when a woman testifies that she has been raped, she says in effect
all that is necessary to show that rape was committed, especially when her
testimony is clear and free from contradiction and her sincerity and candor, free
from suspicion"; (d) besides, "a young girl like the offended party
herein would not expose herself publicly airing acts repugnant to modesty and
her honor unless she is urged by the force of sincerity and by the honest
desire to obtain redress for her grievance"; and (e) the offended party's
failure to shout for help is not proof of the absence of resistance because the
accused-appellant "threatened to kill her if she should shout or do
anything against his wishes."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 June 1991, the accused-appellant filed his Notice of Appeal<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Both errors are jointly discussed by the accused-appellant who
advances the following arguments in support thereof:</p>

<p class="BODY">(a)  "[T]he theory of
the prosecution is so improbable to be worthy of credence and belief"; it
is "much more incredible than that of the defense." The trial court
"totally disregarded the evidence of the accused merely for (sic) the
perception that his evidence is incredible." It "did not bother to
consider the circumstances tending to establish that there was no intimidation
whatsoever and that the complainant consented to the sexual congress of (sic)
the accused.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(b)  There is no basis to
the trial court's conclusion that the offended party was forcibly taken at gun
point by the accused in a motorized tricycle because although the said offended
party testified that the accused told her that “you go with me or else I will
shoot you,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the accused-appellant was not then holding a gun but only "the handle of
the motorcycle."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(c)  On direct
examination, the offended party declared that she was on her way home
"from the house of her barkada" when she was forcibly taken by the
accused-appellant yet, on cross-examination, "she testified that she was
roaming Dagupan City to look for her father at Pantranco station."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(d)  During the sexual
congress, "it can be inferred that she actually consented to the desire of
the accused.  There was no indication
whatsoever that complainant manifestly resisted the rape nor did she bother to
flee or shout for help.  On the contrary
complainant [was] <u>tickled</u> when she was being kissed and embraced by the
accused.  Under these circumstances it
would be unnatural for a woman to tickle (sic) considering that what is
happening to her is a traumatic experience."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(e)  The conduct of the
offended party after the incident is "contrary to common experience and
observation"; anger and hatred are what a rape victim should feel; in the
case of the offended party, she was dropped off at Arellano Bani where she was
given P10.00 by the accused-appellant, then she went home and slept and on the
following morning she proceeded with her normal chores.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">He then concludes that his guilt was not proved beyond reasonable
doubt and that the trial court, instead of applying the presumption of
innocence in his favor, presumed him guilty.  He prays that We reverse the assailed decision and acquit him of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the crime
charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the Brief for the Appellee,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> the
People maintains otherwise and insists that the prosecution was able to
establish all the elements of the complex crime of forcible abduction<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
with rape<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the trial court did not err in giving weight and credence to the
testimony of the offended party which it found to be categorical and
straightforward.  It stresses that it
would be highly unusual and contrary to human nature for her to impute the
commission of a heinous crime to another person if it were not true.  As to the element of force, the People
maintains that it need not be irresistible; so long as it brings the desired
result, all considerations of whether or not it was irresistible is beside the
point.  What is essential is that the
act was accomplished against the will of the offended party and despite her
resistance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The People further contends that:</p>

<p class="2Q">"In any case, as a mentally retarded girl, complainant was not<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>only ‘deprived of reason or otherwise
unconscious’ but also had the mentality and intelligence of a girl ‘under
twelve years of age.’ The deprivation of reason contemplated by law does not
need to be complete.  Mental abnormality
or deficiency is enough (People vs. Nguyen, G.R. No. 93433, August 5,
1991)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the People stresses that the issue which confronted the
trial court was one of credibility of witnesses since the "version
proffered by the accused-appellant was but a mere denial which partakes the
nature of an alibi,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, its findings on credibility deserve the highest respect because it was
in the best position to see the witnesses, hear them testify and observe their
demeanor on the witness stand.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue on the mental state of the offended party raised by the
People deserves attention for if, indeed, she were "a mentally retarded
girl" and had "the mentality and intelligence of a girl ‘under twelve
years of age,’" then, in the light of the accused-appellant's admission
that he had carnal knowledge with her, the affirmance of the conviction would
be inevitable.  If sexual intercourse
with a woman under twelve (12) years of age is rape under the third circumstance
of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, then, it should follow that carnal
knowledge with a woman above twelve (12) years of age whose mental capacity is
that of a child below twelve (12) years of age constitutes rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its challenged decision, the trial court is silent regarding
the alleged mental retardation of the offended party -- a fourth grader who
was, however, an out-of-school youth at the time of the incident.  If she were, the trial court would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">have
immediately seized that fact and decided the case against the accused-appellant
solely on that ground.  We have
carefully examined the original records of this case and the transcripts of the
stenographic notes of the testimonies of the witnesses and, except for the
following manifestation, reservation of objection and statement of the court
before the offended party, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"PROSECUTOR MANAOIS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>We have no other witness
inside the courtroom, your Honor.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Before the witness will testify,
your Honor, may we make of record that the witness is retarded, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. MORALES:</blockquote>

<blockquote>May we also manifest,
your Honor that she be asked few questions if she could answer intelligently
then we could object, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>She is mentally retarded.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">have found nothing else to show that,
indeed, the offended party is mentally retarded.  On the contrary, the foregoing manifestations and statement of
the court were followed by nine (9) pages, typewritten in single-space, of
direct examination questions propounded to and intelligently answered by the
offended party,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein she narrated the sordid details of her forcible abduction and
rape.  She also withstood the grueling
cross-examination conducted some three (3) weeks later.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
No <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">evidence
was adduced to prove the victim's mental capacity.  The </span>trial court gave full faith to her testimony and
resolved the culpability of the accused-appellant on the basis thereof.  The contention, then, of the People that she
is mentally retarded is not supported by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">And now to the assignment of errors.  It is obvious that at the bottom thereof is the factual findings
of the trial court which, in turn, involve the issue of credibility of
witnesses.  It is axiomatic that
appellate courts will generally not disturb the factual findings of the trial
court since the latter is in a better position to weigh conflicting
testimonies, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their
deportment and manner of testifying, unless it is found that the trial court
has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if
considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> In
the instant case, the defense points to Us, as earlier adverted to, certain
facts or circumstances which it feels the trial court failed to consider and
which, if considered, could have altered the result of the case or entitled him
to an acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Guided by the basic principles in the review of rape cases, to
wit:  (1) an accusation for rape can be
made with facility, (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape
where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony of the complainant
must be scrutinized with extreme caution, and (3) the evidence for the
prosecution must stand or fall on its merits and cannot be allowed to draw
strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense;<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

&quot;Courier New&quot;">n</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">ce and, except for the assailed finding of the trial court that
the offended party was abducted "at gun point," found no cogent
reason to depart from the above rule on the conclusiveness of the trial court's
determination on the issue of credibility of witnesses and its findings of
fact.  The above error of the trial

<p class="BODY">Nor are We impressed with the claim of the accused-appellant that
the victim consented to the sexual intercourse since there was no manifest
resistance on her part or an attempt to flee or shout for help, and that, on
the contrary, she was <u>tickled</u> when she was being kissed and embraced by
the accused-appellant.  The threat
employed on the offended party did not end after she rode on his tricycle; it
was, in fact, a continuing threat because he had not yet accomplished his
principal objective, <i>i.e.</i>, the rape of the victim.  The fear instilled in the victim could by no
means be considered as having ceased or diminished; on the contrary, her being
forcibly taken out of the city and into a remote area at nighttime could not
but have heightened her fears.  At the
place he had chosen to unleash his bestial instinct, he raped her.  She testified as follows on direct
examination:</p>

<p class="BODY">The offended party's failure to flee or to shout for help was
satisfactorily explained by her.  The

re-direct examination, she testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You

<p class="BODY">The <u>tickling</u>, capitalized upon by the accused-appellant as

<p class="BODY">Read in the light of her previous and succeeding answers, it is
obvious that no reasonable and logical inference can be drawn therefrom that
her being tickled by the kiss amounted to consent to the rape.  For, as a matter of fact, she categorically
declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did he tell you if he told you anything?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The accused told (sic)

<p class="BODY">Finally, her actuations after the incident were not
unnatural.  It was established that she
was threatened with death by the accused-appellant if she will report the
incident, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You

<p class="BODY">Anyway, she did finally report the matter to her mother on the

Considering a Filipina's inbred modesty and antipathy in airing publicly things
which affect her honor, it is difficult to believe that she would admit the

herself to ridicule if her charge were not true.  If she does undergo the expense, trouble and inconvenience of a
public trial, suffer scandals, embarrassments and humiliation (such action
would indubitably invite, as well as allow, an examination of her private
parts), it is due to her desire to bring to justice the person who had abused
her.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, it is unnecessary to delve into
the defense put up by the accused-appellant.  After all, as admitted by him, his theory is <u>incredible</u>, albeit
stating that that of the prosecution is "much more incredible than that of
the defense."</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, the prosecution has successfully discharged its burden
of proving beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused-appellant for the
complex crime of forcible abduction with rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 342 of the Revised Penal Code, the two (2) elements
of forcible abduction are the taking of a woman (a) against her will and (b)
with lewd designs.  Lewd designs means

threats and intimidation, and therefore against her will, taken by the
accused-appellant from Dagupan City to San Miguel, Calasiao, Pangasinan.  That it was with lewd design is evident from
the fact that <u>rape</u> was, in fact, committed.  And rape, under any clime and civilization will always be
unchaste.  The forcible abduction,
however, was but the means to commit the crime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">of rape.  Rape was committed when the accused-appellant had carnal
knowledge of the offended party through intimidation.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn49" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

then to Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for the more serious
crime shall be imposed.  The more
serious crime is rape which, in the instant case, absent a showing that it was
