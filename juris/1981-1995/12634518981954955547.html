reversal of the decision dated August 14, 1974<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in CA-G.R. No. 13243-CR entitled "People 
of the Philippines, plaintiff-appellee, vs. Mapalad Aisporna, 
defendant-appellant" of respondent Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of 
the City Court of Cabanatuan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> rendered 
on August 2, 1971 which found the petitioner guilty for having violated Section 
189 of the Insurance Act (Act No. 2427, as amended) and sentenced her to pay a 
fine of P500.00 with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay 
the costs. 
<p>Petitioner Aisporna was charged in the City Court of Cabanatuan for violation 
of Section 189 of the Insurance Act on November 21, 1970 in an information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> which reads as follows: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>"That on or before the 21st day of June, 1969, in the City of Cabanatuan, 
Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously act as agent in the solicitation or procurement of an application 
for insurance by soliciting therefor the application of one Eugenio S. Isidro, 
for and in behalf of Perla Compania de Seguros, Inc., a duly organized insurance 
company, registered under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines, resulting 
in the issuance of a Broad Personal Accident Policy No. 28PI-RSA 0001 in the 
amount not exceeding FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5,000.00) dated June 21, 1969, 
without said accused having first secured a certificate of authority to act as 
such agent from the office of the Insurance Commissioner, Republic of the 
Philippines. </p>
<p>"CONTRARY TO LAW." </p></blockquote>
<p>The facts,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> as found by the 
respondent Court of Appeals are quoted hereunder: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>"IT RESULTING: That there is no debate that since 7 March, 1969 and as of 21 
June, 1969, appellant's husband, Rodolfo S. Aisporna was duly licensed by 
Insurance Commission as agent to Perla Compania de Seguros, with license to 
expire on 30 June, 1970, Exh. C; on that date, at Cabanatuan City, Personal 
Accident Policy, Exh. D was issued by Perla thru its authorized representative, 
Rodolfo S. Aisporna, for a period of twelve (12) months with beneficiary as Ana 
M. Isidro, and for P5,000.00; apparently, insured died by violence during 
lifetime of policy, and for reasons not explained in record, present information 
was filed by Fiscal, with assistance of private prosecutor, charging wife of 
Rodolfo with violation of Sec. 189 of Insurance Law for having, wilfully, 
unlawfully, and feloniously acted, </p></blockquote>
<p>'as agent in the solicitation for insurance by soliciting therefore the 
application of one Eugenio S. Isidro for and in behalf of Perla Compa√±a de 
Seguros, x x x without said accused having first secured a certificate of 
authority to act as such agent from the office of the Insurance Commission, 
Republic of the Philippines.' 
</p><p>and in the trial, People presented evidence that was hardly disputed, that 
aforementioned policy was issued with active participation of appellant wife of 
Rodolfo, against which appellant in her defense sought to show that being the 
wife of true agent, Rodolfo, she naturally helped him in his work, as clerk, and 
that policy was merely a renewal and was issued because Isidro had called by 
telephone to renew, and at that time, her husband, Rodolfo, was absent and so 
she left a note on top of her husband's desk to renew x x x." 
</p><p>Consequently, the trial court found herein petitioner guilty as charged. On 
appeal, the trial court's decision was affirmed by the respondent appellate 
court finding the petitioner guilty of a violation of the first paragraph of 
Section 189 of the Insurance Act. Hence, this present recourse was filed on 
October 22, 1974.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>In its resolution of October 28, 1974,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> this Court resolved, without giving due 
course to this instant petition, to require the respondent to comment on the 
aforesaid petition. In the comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
filed on December 20, 1974, the respondent, represented by the Office of the 
Solicitor General, submitted that petitioner may not be considered as having 
violated Section 189 of the Insurance Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> On April 3, 1975, petitioner submitted his 
Brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> while the Solicitor General, on 
behalf of the respondent, filed a manifestation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> in lieu of a Brief on May 3, 1975 
reiterating his stand that the petitioner has not violated Section 189 of the 
Insurance Act. 
</p><p>In seeking reversal of the judgment of conviction, petitioner assigns the 
following errors<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> allegedly committed 
by the appellate court: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>"1. THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THAT RECEIPT OF 
COMPENSATION IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE CRIME DEFINED BY THE FIRST 
PARAGRAPH OF SECTION 189 OF THE INSURANCE ACT. </p>
<p>"2. THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN GIVING DUE WEIGHT TO EXHIBITS F, 
F-1, TO F-17, INCLUSIVE SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH PETITIONER'S GUILT BEYOND 
REASONABLE DOUBT. </p>
<p>"3. THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING HEREIN 
PETITIONER." </p></blockquote>
<p>We find the petition meritorious. 
</p><p>The main issue raised is whether or not a person can be convicted of having 
violated the first paragraph of Section 189 of the Insurance Act without 
reference to the second paragraph of the same section. In other words, it is 
necessary to determine whether or not the agent mentioned in the first paragraph 
of the aforesaid section is governed by the definition of an insurance agent 
found on its second paragraph. 
</p><p>The pertinent provision of Section 189 of the Insurance Act reads as follows: 

</p><blockquote>
<p>"No insurance company doing business within the Philippine Islands, nor any 
agent thereof, shall pay any commission or other compensation to any person for 
services in obtaining new insurance, unless such person shall have first 
procured from the Insurance Commissioner a certificate of authority to act as an 
agent of such company as hereinafter provided. No person shall act as agent, 
subagent, or broker in the solicitation of procurement of applications for 
insurance, or receive for services in obtaining new insurance, any commission or 
other compensation from any insurance company doing business in the Philippine 
Islands, or agent thereof, without first procuring a certificate of authority so 
to act from the Insurance Commissioner, which must be renewed annually on the 
first day of January, or within six months thereafter. Such certificate shall be 
issued by the Insurance Commissioner only upon the written application of 
persons desiring such authority, such application being approved and 
countersigned by the company such person desires to represent, and shall be upon 
a form approved by the Insurance Commissioner, giving such information as he may 
require. The Insurance Commissioner shall have the right to refuse to issue or 
renew and to revoke any such certificate in his discretion. No such certificate 
shall be valid, however, in any event after the first day of July of the year 
following the issuing of such certificate. Renewal certificates may be issued 
upon the application of the company. </p>
<p>"Any person who for compensation solicits or obtains insurance on behalf of 
any insurance company, or transmits for a person other than himself an 
application for a policy of insurance to or from such company or offers or 
assumes to act in the negotiating of such insurance, shall be an insurance agent 
within the intent of this section, and shall thereby become liable to all the 
duties, requirements, liabilities, and penalties to which an agent of such 
company is subject. </p>
<p>"Any person or company violating the provisions of this section shall be 
fined in the sum of five hundred pesos. On the conviction of any person acting 
as agent, subagent, or broker, of the commission of any offense connected with 
the business of insurance, the Insurance Commissioner shall immediately revoke 
the certificate of authority issued to him and no such certificate shall 
thereafter be issued to such convicted person." </p></blockquote>
<p>A careful perusal of the above-quoted provision shows that the first 
paragraph thereof prohibits a person from acting as agent, subagent or broker in 
the solicitation or procurement of applications for insurance without first 
procuring a certificate of authority so to act from the Insurance Commissioner, 
while its second paragraph defines who is an insurance agent within the intent 
of this section and, finally, the third paragraph thereof prescribes the penalty 
to be imposed for its violation. 
</p><p>The respondent appellate court ruled that the petitioner is prosecuted not 
under the second paragraph of Section 189 of the aforesaid Act but under its 
first paragraph. Thus - 
</p><blockquote>
<p>"x x x it can no longer be denied that it was appellant's most active 
endeavors that resulted in issuance of policy to Isidro, she was there and then 
acting as agent, and received the pay therefor - her defense that she was only 
acting as helper of her husband can no longer be sustained, neither her point 
that she received no compensation for issuance of the policy because 
</p></blockquote>
<p>'any person who for compensation solicits or obtains insurance on behalf of 
any insurance company or transmits for a person other than himself an 
application for a policy of insurance to or from such company or offers or 
assumes to act in the negotiating of such insurance, shall be an insurance agent 
within the intent of this section, and shall thereby become liable to all the 
duties, requirements, liabilities, and penalties, to which an agent of such 
company is subject.' paragraph 2, Sec. 189, Insurance Law, 
</p><p>now it is true that information does not even allege that she had obtained 
the insurance, 
</p><p>'for compensation' 
</p><p>which is the gist of the offense in Section 189 of the Insurance Law in its 
2nd paragraph, but what appellant apparently overlooks is that she is prosecuted 
not under the 2nd but under the 1st paragraph of Sec. 189 wherein it is provided 
that, 
</p><p>'No person shall act as agent, subagent, or broker, in the solicitation or 
procurement of applications for insurance, or receive for services in obtaining 
new insurance any commission or other compensation from any insurance company 
doing business in the Philippine Island, or agent thereof, without first 
procuring a certificate of authority to act from the insurance commissioner, 
which must be renewed annually on the first day of January, or within six months 
thereafter.' 
</p><p>therefore, there was no technical defect in the wording of the charge, so 
that Errors 2 and 4 must be overruled."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
</p><p>From the above-mentioned ruling, the respondent appellate court seems to 
imply that the definition of an insurance agent under the second paragraph of 
Section 189 is not applicable to the insurance agent mentioned in the first 
paragraph. Parenthetically, the respondent court concludes that under the second 
paragraph of Section 189, a person is an insurance agent if he solicits and 
obtains an insurance for compensation, but, in its first paragraph, there is no 
necessity that a person solicits an insurance for compensation in order to be 
called an insurance agent. 
</p><p>We find this to be a reversible error. As correctly pointed out by the 
Solicitor General, the definition of an insurance agent as found in the second 
paragraph of Section 189 is intended to define the word "agent" mentioned in the 
first and second paragraphs of the aforesaid section. More significantly, in its 
second paragraph, it is explicitly provided that the definition of an insurance 
agent is within the intent of Section 189. Hence - 
</p><blockquote>
<p>"Any person who for compensation x x x shall be an insurance agent within the 
intent of this section, x x x." </p></blockquote>
<p>Patently, the definition of an insurance agent under the second paragraph 
holds true with respect to the agent mentioned in the other two paragraphs of 
the said section. The second paragraph of Section 189 is a definition and 
interpretative clause intended to qualify the term "agent" mentioned in both the 
first and third paragraphs of the aforesaid section. 
</p><p>Applying the definition of an insurance agent in the second paragraph to the 
agent mentioned in the first and second paragraphs would give harmony to the 
aforesaid three paragraphs of Section 189. Legislative intent must be 
ascertained from a consideration of the statute as a whole. The particular 
words, clauses and phrases should not be studied as detached and isolated 
expressions, but the whole and every part of the statute must be considered in 
fixing the meaning of any of its parts and in order to produce harmonious 
whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> A statute must be so construed 
as to harmonize and give effect to all its provisions whenever possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The meaning of the law, it must be borne 
in mind, is not to be extracted from any single part, portion or section or from 
isolated words and phrases, clauses or sentences but from a general 
consideration or view of the act as a whole.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Every part of the statute must be 
interpreted with reference to the context. This means that every part of the 
statute must be considered together with the other parts, and kept subservient 
to the general intent of the whole enactment, not separately and 
independently.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> More importantly, the 
doctrine of associated words (Noscitur a Sociis) provides that where a 
particular word or phrase in a statement is ambiguous in itself or is equally 
susceptible of various meanings, its true meaning may be made clear and specific 
by considering the company in which it is found or with which it is 
associated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
</p><p>Considering that the definition of an insurance agent as found in the second 
paragraph is also applicable to the agent mentioned in the first paragraph, to 
receive a compensation by the agent is an essential element for a violation of 
the first paragraph of the aforesaid section. The appellate court has 
established ultimately that the petitioner-accused did not receive any 
compensation for the issuance of the insurance policy of Eugenio Isidro. 
Nevertheless, the accused was convicted by the appellate court for, according to 
the latter, the receipt of compensation for issuing an insurance policy is not 
an essential element for a violation of the first paragraph of Section 189 of 
the Insurance Act. 
</p><p>We rule otherwise. Under the Texas Penal Code 1911, Article 689, making it a 
misdemeanor for any person for direct or indirect compensation to solicit 
insurance without a certificate of authority to act as an insurance agent, an 
information, failing to allege that the solicitor was to receive compensation 
either directly or indirectly, charges no offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In the case of Bolen vs. Stake,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> the provision of Section 3750, Snyder's 
Compiled Laws of Oklahoma 1909 is intended to penalize persons only who acted as 
insurance solicitors without license, and while acting in such capacity 
negotiated and concluded insurance contracts for compensation. It must be noted 
that the information, in the case at bar, does not allege that the negotiation 
of an insurance contract by the accused with Eugenio Isidro was one for 
compensation. This allegation is essential, and having been omitted, a 
conviction of the accused could not be sustained. It is well-settled in Our 
jurisprudence that to warrant conviction, every element of the crime must be 
alleged and proved.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> 
</p><p>After going over the records of this case, We are fully convinced, as the 
Solicitor General maintains, that accused did not violate Section 189 of the 
Insurance Act. 
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the judgment appealed from is reversed and the 
accused is acquitted of the crime charged, with costs de oficio. </p><strong>SO 
ORDERED. </strong><br><em><br>Teehankee, Acting C.J., Makasiar, Fernandez,
