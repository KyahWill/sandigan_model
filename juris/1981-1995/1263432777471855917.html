				<H3>CIPRIANO PEÑAFLORIDA, PETITIONER, VS. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS, NEW & SPECIAL PROVINCIAL BOARD OF CANVASSERS OF ILOILO AND RAMON DUREMDES, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MELENCIO-HERRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">  </span>A quick look at the three preceding cases elevated to this
Court on Certiorari revolving around the elective <span style="">position of Vice-Governor of Iloilo is in order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">1. In </span>“<u>Duremdes
v. Provincial Board of Canvassers, </u><u><span style="">COMELEC,
and Penaflorida</span></u><span style=""> (G.R </span>Nos.
86362-63, 27 October 1989, 178 SCRA 746), we upheld the COMELEC Decision
ordering the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Iloilo (PBC) to immediately
reconvene, include in the canvass the questioned election returns and prepare a
new Statement of Votes, after we had found that DUREMDES’ proclamation was
based on an incomplete canvass.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. In “<u>Penaflorida v. COMELEC and DUREMDES</u>, (G.R. No.
93376, 19 July, 1990), the PBC did reconvene but because the COMELEC ordered
the physical examination of the questioned election returns (PBC copy and other
election returns copies).  PENAFLORIDA
sought to enjoin the conduct of said physical examination.  The Court denied that plea <span style="">and held</span> that it was best that the
physical examination of different copies of the questioned election returns be
made to verify the number of votes in the election returns from which the
Statement of Votes could be tabulated.  The Court also directed the COMELEC to proceed with dispatch with the
physical examination of the questioned election returns so that the true will
of the electorate of Iloilo could be <span style="">determined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. In <u>Penaflorida v. COMELEC</u> (G.R. No. 96760, 19 June 1991,
198 SCRA 454), Penaflorida charged the COMELEC with grave abuse of discretion
for having conducted the physical examination without notice to him and in his
absence, and prayed for the re-examination of all 110 contested election
returns.  We rejected the plea for
re-examination but in order to afford PENAFLOFIIDA an opportunity to see for
himself <span style="">the discarded returns, we
directed the COMELEC to </span><span style="">allow him
</span><span style="">to examine, within a period of
three (3) days, </span>the<span style=""> forty-nine
(49) questioned election returns which the </span><span style="">COMELEC </span><u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style=""> “found to be fake, or substituted or
systematically tampered with and no longer reflective of </span>the<span style=""> </span>true <span style="">results of the election.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Also assailed by
PENAFLORIDA in this case was the COMELEC Order of 11 February 1991 declaring
that it had completed</span> <span style="">the
physical examination and comparison of the questioned election returns and
found that of the 110 questioned election returns in nine (9) municipalities of
Iloilo, forty-nine (49) returns from four (4) municipalities had been
“systematically tampered” with or substituted.  Thus, with respect to said forty-nine (49) questioned returns, the
COMELEC ordered that the COMELEC copy or ballot box copy of said election
returns be used for canvassing, instead of the usual PBC copy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The same Order required
the PBC to convene within five (5) days from notification and to complete the
canvass, utilizing for the purpose the PBC copies for those precincts the
returns of which were not questioned, and for those which were, such election
returns, per precinct, as specified in the Order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After PENAFLORIDA had
examined the aforesaid returns, the COMELEC issued a series of Orders, which
eventually led to the filing of the fourth case, i.e.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4. <u>G.R. No. 101753</u> (the present case).</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">first Order, dated 22
August 1991, directed the taking of the thumbprints of the Chairman and/or any
Member of the Board of Election Inspectors of the questioned precincts</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">for
comparison with the thumbprints reflected in the election returns, “with prior
notice to parties of the date and place of said fingerprint taking.” The Order
was prompted by the “desire (of the COMELEC) to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">further determine the
genuineness, authenticity and due execution of the election returns with
conflicting entries” and in deference to the request of the new members who had
not taken part in the previous </span>de<span style="">liberation
namely, Chairman </span><span style="">Monsod a</span><span style="">n</span><span style="">d
</span><span style="">Commissioner Maambong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">PENAFLORIDA moved for the
immediate implementation of the 22 August 1991 Order in his Manifestation and
Motion, dated </span><span style="">9 </span><span style="">September 1991.  In its Order, dated 12 September 1991, however, the COMELEC,
after s</span><span style="">tat</span><span style="">ing that the thumbprint </span>taking <span style="">had already been accomplished on September
1991, directed the thumbprint examiners “to </span>immediately <span style="">conduct a comparative examination of the </span>thumbprints
<span style="">taken with those thumbprints appear</span>ing
<span style="">in the election returns.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">PENAFLORIDA thereafter
filed a Manifestation, dated 13 September 1991, praying for a retaking of the
thumbprints </span>as it <span style="">had received</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">no prior notice with res</span><span style="">pect </span><span style="">thereto.  The COMELEC brushed
aside that plea in its assailed </span><span style="">Order,
dated</span><span style=""> 18 September 1991,
stating, among others, that said examination was but part of its internal
procedure; and since the results of the “dactyloscopic examination” confirmed
its original findings reflected in its Order of 11 February 1991, it directed
the PBC, with prior notice to the </span><span style="">p</span><span style="">arties, to reconvene within five (5) days,
proceed with the canvass of the election returns and proclaim the winning
candidate.  The PBC set 2 October 1991
for the canvass and proclamation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 <span style="">September 1991,
PENAFLORIDA instituted the present Certiorari Petition praying that the COMELEC
Order of 18 September 1991 be set aside for having been issued with g</span><span style="">ra</span><span style="">ve
abuse of discretion as the COMELEC had failed to notify him of the fingerprint
taking in contravention of its earlier Order that the same be conducted with
prior notice to the parties.  He
contends that the thumbprint taking was never meant by the COMELEC to be an
“internal </span>procedure” <span style="">in its 22
August 1991 Order but that it was necessary</span> <span style="">in order to determine the genuineness and authenticity of the different
copies of the questioned election returns.  He then prays that, in equity, the COMELEC be ordered to conduct a
recount of ballots in all the forty-nine (40) precincts and that a proclamation
of the winning candidate be made on the basis of the results of the recounting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We required Com</span><span style="">m</span><span style="">ents
from all respondents and, as PENAFLORIDA had prayed for, we issued a Temporary </span><span style="">Restrai</span><span style="">ning Order </span>o<span style="">n 1 October
199</span>1<span style=""> </span>e<span style="">njoining the PBC of Iloilo </span><span style="">from</span><span style=""> reconvening on 2 October 1991 and the COMELEC from enforcing its
questioned Order of 18 September 1991.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>appears <span style="">that, as Respondent DUREMDES pointed out in
his Comment, PENAFLORIDA had three (3) pending Motions before the COMELEC at
the time he filed this Petition, </span>(1) <span style="">an “Urgent Motion for Recount of Ballots” filed on 18 September 1991;
(2) a “Most Urgent Omnibus Motion” </span>filed on<span style=""> 23 September 1991, the main thrust of which was the nullification of
the thumbprint-taking conducted in Iloilo City on 5 September 1991 and the
suspension of any action</span> on the<span style="">
case until rulings therein had been rendered; and </span>(3) <span style="">an “Urgent Ex-Parte Motion to Resolve Pending
Incidents” filed on 25 September 1991.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If </span>for <span style="">this alone, the Petition is dismissible on
the </span>ground o<span style="">f</span> <span style="">prematurity for failure to exhaust
administrative remedies.  However, with
the end in view of putting a final termination to this protracted controversy, </span><span style="">we </span><span style="">will </span>nonetheless resolve <span style="">the
Petition on the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">PENAFLORIDA's submissions
call for rejection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The COMELEC Order, dated
22 August 1991, did state that t</span>he <span style="">thumbprint
taking was to be conducted with prior notice to the </span>parties, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“ACCORDINGLY, the Director, Election Records and Statistics
Department is hereby directed to assign and send immediately fingerprint
experts to Iloilo in coordination with the Provincial Election Supervisor to
the fingerprints of the Chairman and/or any Member of the Board of Election
inspectors the above named precincts, <u>with prior notice to parties </u><u><span style="">of the date and place of said fingerprint
taking</span></u><span style="">.” (Underscoring o</span>urs).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To be noted, however, is
the fact that neither the Omnibus Election Code (B.P. Blg. 881) nor the
Electoral Reforms Law (Rep. Act No. 6646), the governing legislation during the
18 January 1988 local elections, provide, much less, outline the pr</span>o<span style="">cedure to followed for such an examination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is basis,
therefore, for the COMELEC ruling in it</span>s<span style=""> Order of 18 September 1991 that the fingerprint taking was</span> <span style="">merely “part </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">its internal procedure.” Worthy of recall is that all the COMELEC had
to do after this Court had promulgated the Decision in G.R. No. 96760, <u>supra</u>,</span>
<span style="">was to h</span>a<span style="">ve afforded PENAFLORIDA the opportunity to see for himself the election
returns which were found to have been </span>fake, <span style="">substituted or tampered with, nothing more.  There was really no compulsion for the COMELEC to order the
thumbprint taking but it did so “in its desire to further determine the
genuineness, authenticity and due execution </span>of the election <span style="">returns with questionable entries.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it was not PENAFLORIDA who asked for <span style="">the thumbprint takin</span>g.  <span style="">That
initiative came from the COMELEC itself, </span>which “wanted to make sure that
its previous ruling was <span style="">indeed correct”
(COMELEC Order, dated 30 September </span>1991, p. <span style="">10).  That objective can be
further </span>gleaned from <span style="">the fact
that it was the newly appointed COMELEC Chairman and another new Member,
Commissioner Maambong, both of whom had not participated in the earlier
deliberations, who prevailed upon the other Members to allow the thumbprint
taking (ibid., p. 6) so that they could satisfy themselves of the authenticity
of the copies of the election returns earlier chosen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In effect, the thumprint
taking was conducted to assist the Commissioners in resolving the issue on the
genuineness, authenticity and due execution of the forty-nine (49) election
returns found to be fake, substituted or tampered with.  Said fingerprint examination and </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">comparison </span><span style="">made between
the spec specimens taken by the fingerprint experts and those</span> contained
in <span style="">the returns are actually part of </span>the
decision-making process.  <span style="">The parties, therefore</span><span style="">, are not,</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">as </span>a matter <span style="">of right, entitled to be present during the
examination nor to confront the experts on the result of their work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should also be pointed
out that no substantial rights were impaired by the absence of the parties in
the thumprint taking.  Both PENAFLORIDA
and DUREMDES were not notified thereof.  There was no discrimination by the COMELEC in DUREMDES' favor to speak
of, as PENAFLORIDA charges.  Although
PENAFLORIDA claims that Respondent DUREMDES was present during the thumbprint
taking, the COMELEC has not confirmed the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither can it be
successfully said that there were irregularities attendant to the thumbprint
taking.  No proof</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">was
adduced by PENAFLORIDA evidencing such alleged irregularities.  On the contrary, Commissioner Maambong
supervised the examination from beginning to end.  The whole process itself was transparent.  The procedure undertaken during the
thumbprint taking, outlined in the </span><span style="">COMELEC
</span><span style="">Order, dated 30 September 1991,
speaks for itself.  Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>submitted reports of the
process indicate that a Commissioner of the Comelec supervised the thumbprint
taking.  He was assisted by Regional
Director Rodol<span style="">f</span>o B. Sarroza,
Asst. Regional Director Jose G. Granada, and Provincial Election Supervisor
Hector M. Masna, with a <span style="">compliment of
nine (9) personnel of the Iloilo Comelec Office.  The thumbprints - two impressions of the right thumb for </span><span style="">e</span><span style="">ach
subject - were impressed in prepared forms, and the taking was witnessed by the
Supervising Commissioner and the </span><span style="">two
</span><span style="">fingerprint examiners.  The thumbprint impressions were then placed
in sealed envelopes as they were brought to Manila.  Likewise, the comparative examination in the Comelec Office in
Manila was done by the fingerprint examiners who went to Iloilo City, in </span><span style="">c</span><span style="">oordination
with the different custodians of the election returns.  x x x” (ibid, p. 11).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If any error can be
attributed at all to the COMELEC, it would be its failure to notify the parties
of the fingerprint examination despite its order to do so.  At most, this is a procedural flaw, not a
substantial defect, that can not be equated with grave abuse of discretion by
reason of which Certiorari would lie.  Errors of procedure or judgment are not correctible by Certiorari.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As c</span><span style="">orrectly held by the COMELEC, even if a </span><span style="">thumbprint re-taking </span><span style="">is conducted, “a comparison of these
thumbprints with those appearing in the different copies of the election
returns will certainly yield the same results” since fingerprints cannot be
forged.  Besides, there is no change to
the COMELEC Order of 11 </span><span style="">Feb</span><span style="">rua</span><span style="">ry </span><span style="">1991 that the PBC
copies for those precincts w</span><span style="">hose
r</span><span style="">eturns were not questioned were
to be utilized, and for those questioned, the specified election returns, per
precinct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It behooves the COMELEC,
however, particularl</span>y<span style=""> its per</span>sonnel,<span style=""> </span><span style="">to
be more meticulous and painstaking in the execution and implementation of
Orders.  The Court notes </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">failure of notice of the conduct of physical </span><span style="">examination </span><span style="">was Petitioner PENAFLORIDA's same plaint in G.R. No. 96760, and which
has contributed in no small m</span><span style="">easure
</span><span style="">to further delay in the final
resoluti</span>on<span style=""> of this </span><span style="">controversy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We now<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">turn
to PENAFLORIDA's urgings that at this </span><span style="">late </span><span style="">point in time,
reliance on election returns is no longer justifiable and that a recount of the
ballots in all the questioned precincts is the best equitable </span>remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We</span><span style=""> disagree.  In the first place, there is no basis for a</span><span style=""> r</span>ecount since the election returns are
available.  Secondly<span style="">, </span><span style="">in G.R. N</span>o.86362-63, entitled “Duremdes v. Provincial Board of
Canvassers<span style="">,” (</span>27 October 1989,
178 SCRA 746), the questioned election returns, 110 in all, had <span style="">already been pinpointed and ordered included
in the canvass.  In G. R. No. 93376,
entitled “Penaflorida v. COMELEC, (19 July 1990), this Court ordered the
physical examination of the said questioned election returns.  And in G. R. No. 96760 similarly entitled
“Penafiorida v. COMELEC,” (19 June 1991, 198 SCRA 454), with the physical
examination and comparison of questioned election returns accomplished, we
upheld the COMELEC finding that of the 110 questioned election returns,
forty-nine (49) returns had </span><span style="">been</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">systematical</span><span style="">l</span><span style="">y
</span><span style="">tampered with or substituted so
that with respect to the latter the COMELEC copy or ballot box copy of said
election return i</span><span style="">s </span><span style="">to be used for </span><span style="">canvassing </span><span style="">instead of
the usual PBC copy.  With the affirmance
by this Court of the aforesaid COMELEC rulings, the recount prayed for by
Petitioner PENAFLORIDA is out of the question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, Petitioner PENAFLORIDA's lawyers continually
harp on the alleged erroneous ruling of this Court <span style="">in G.R. No. 96760 </span><span style="">(<u>supra</u>)
</span><span style="">that “particular copies of the
(forty nine [49] questioned election returns) were found to be fake,
substituted or systematically tampered with and no longer reflective of the
results of the elections,” averring that there was no such finding by the </span><span style="">COMELEC.  </span><span style="">While</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">it
may be that the COMELEC Order itself of 11 February 1991 did not specifically
pinpoint a particular election return as fake, substituted or tampered with
since confined itself to the particular copies of the election returns to be
used in the canvass, yet, the basis for selecting the copies of the election
returns other than the PBC copy, was well explained before this Court by
Commissioner Rama during the 21 February 1991 hearing in G.R. No. 96760, which
Petit</span><span style="">i</span><span style="">oner's counsel attended.  Commissioner Rama precisely explained that
the findings of </span><span style="">the</span><span style=""> COMELEC when it examined the questioned election
returns were that some of them were “fake” or “falsified” </span><span style="">(TSN., </span><span style="">pp. 83-88).  Moreover, the notes
or summary of the COMELEC findings relating to the questioned election returns
were included by the Solicitor General in his Memorandum, dated 28 February
1991, submitted in the aforesaid case.  Therein, reference was made to the finding </span><span style="">th</span><span style="">a</span><span style="">t s</span><span style="">om</span><span style="">e </span><span style="">of the returns were “systematically tampered”
</span><span style="">(p. 10) or </span><span style="">“substituted” (p. 9).  It is Petitioner, therefore who is in error
when he states that there was no such finding made by the COMELEC.  Besides, even assuming that those terms were
not explicitly employed, the COMELEC observations during its physical
examination of the election returns could not but lead to the use of the same
terminologies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, the unassailable
fact remains that Petitioner's counsel deliberately failed to inform this
Court, at the time of the institution of this Petition, of their pending
Motions before the COMELEC, treating practically of the same questions raised
herein, to repeat:  (1) an “Urgent
Motion for Recount of Ballots” filed on 18 September 1991; (2) a “Most Urgent
Omnibus Motion” filed on 23 September 1991; and (3) an “Urgent Ex-Parte Motion
to Resolve.  Pending Incidents” filed on
25 September 1991.  Recourse to this
Court was, therefore, clearly premature.  Counsel's justification that had they not filed this Petition, it would
have been mooted and that </span><span style="">Respondent
</span><span style="">Duremdes would have been
erroneously proclaimed does not free them from culpability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Lawyers owe candor, fairness
and good faith to the </span><span style="">Court
(Canon </span><span style="">10, Code of Professional
Responsibility).  A finding, the</span><span style="">refore, that </span><span style="">Petitioner's lawyers have been </span><span style="">remiss in </span><span style="">this obligation
is inevitable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering that the term
of office of the local </span><span style="">officials
elected during the </span><span style="">18 January
1988 elections is almost </span><span style="">expiring,
there is need for this Decision to </span><span style="">be
