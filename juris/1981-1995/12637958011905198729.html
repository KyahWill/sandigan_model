<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence upon which the lower court based its
finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt is narrated by the said court as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"Complainant </span><span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> Cruz, 16 years old, testified that her mother died
on March 15, 1979 and has been residing with her father, accused Alberto Cruz,
together with her four brothers and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sisters
at San Isidro, <span class="SpellE">Lagao</span>, General </span>Santos City
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alberto - 12 years old; Imelda -

11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> testified that in the month
of July 1983, she was raped by her father twice at midnight but she cannot
remember the exact dates when she was raped; that the first time she was raped
was when her father; accused herein, arrived in the house drunk and he entered
her <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">mos</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">quito net, kissed her, touched her body and removed her clothes; that
at that time complainant's companions sleeping under that mosquito net were the
above-named brothers and sisters; that at the time her father arrived she </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">asleep and was awakened only when he was already kissing her and
removing her clothes; that she struggled </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

not to report the incident or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he will kill

parts of her body and kissed her.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant further testified that she did not shout because
accused warned her that he will kill them all <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

was able to remove and then he inserted his private part <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">on </span>her vagina; that accused was fully
naked when he was on top of her; that some of her brothers and sisters were
awakened at that time but they did not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">help
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">her for fear that their </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">father </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">will spank them if

desire </span>on her; that after putting on his pants and T-shirt, accused
warned complainant that if she will report the incident to her aunt, he will
kill her; that she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">cried after the act,
pleaded and asked </span>accused why he raped her but accused instead did not
listen, slapped her and threatened to kill her and her brothers and sisters if
she will report the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">incident.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The second time she was raped by her father, complainant
cannot also recall the time but it happened also at midnight, his (sic) father
was again drunk, went inside her mosquito net, kissed her, touched her body,
removed her clothes and inserted his penis on her vagina despite her pleas and
accused told her again not to report the incident or else he will kill
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant asked her father why he
did this to her when she is his daughter but he did not mind her; that she did
not shout because her mouth was covered; she was slapped and her head was
pushed against the floor; that she was not able to fight back be­cause if she
will move her hands accused will box her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant was also sleep­ing with her brothers and sisters at that
time and they were again awakened<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> but
could not do anything because their father would spank them.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In September, 1983, complainant claimed that accused raped
her three times under the same situation - <span class="GramE">that</span> it
happened at <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> in their house;
accused was drunk, he entered the mosquito net and had sexual intercourse with
her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the month of October, 1983, the same thing happened -
accused was drunk and had sexual intercourse with complainant; that the
complainant in all these occasions offered resistance but was not able to
prevent him even once because <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> the accused
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">raping her, he boxed her while
removing her clothes and at the same time removed his pants and T-shirt, kissed
her and placed his private organ inside her vagina and had sexual intercourse
with her.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant averred that the first time she was raped in
July, 1983 was her first experience and accused her father, was the first man
to have taken her and she felt pain.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The last time she was raped by the accused in October, 1983,
complainant was able to escape from her house and reported the incident to her
aunt, Maria <span class="SpellE">Hortal</span> on October 5, 1983; that this was
the first opportunity for complainant to report what accused did to her because
in the months of July to October 4, she was afraid that accused might kill all<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> of them as he threatened to do; that she
never had the opportunity likewise to do so because whenever she goes market­ing,
accused will let her brother accompany her to the market and give her the time
to come back home so she cannot report.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"When complainant reported to her aunt that her father was
raping her, she told her in answer to her question that accused raped her twice
in July, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">thrice in September and once
in October, 1983; that the matter was reported to the Police Department and she
was made to see a doctor first; that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Seromines</span>
examined her after which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">medical certificate (Exhibit "A"),
was issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There</span>after she went
back to the police station as instructed for investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There­after, a complaint for rape dated
October 8, 1983 (Exhibit "B") was filed against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Alberto Cruz, Sr., her father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complain</span>ant pointed to the accused as
the man who raped her six (6) times and alleged that she wants her father
placed in jail; that she filed the case because she can no longer bear what her
father did to her; that during the lifetime of her mother, accused boxed her,
he always <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">come home drunk and will not
even look for work and they were always hungry and did not have anything to eat."

aunt, Francisca <span class="SpellE">Laho</span>; that before they lived together

something wrong on her Ate <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> when he rode on top
of <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> in their house at San Isidro, <span class="SpellE">Lagao</span>; that her father did this many times to <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> during midnight; that she could see her father on
top of <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> even if it was nighttime because they
had a small lamp placed in the altar about one meter away; that she saw her
father on top of <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> several times <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">already completely naked and her Ate <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> was also undressed; that her Ate <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span>
cries when her father was on top of her but she could not help her for fear

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that his daughter <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span>
imputed the charge of rape against him out of her hatred for him, borne even
during the lifetime of her mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant stressed the fact that <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span>
testified that she did not love her father because he was a cruel man who
spanked her and her brothers and sisters and slapped her mother (T.S.N. June
18, 1984, pp. 17-18).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant then
alleged that <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> was also jealous because all of
her brothers and sisters were going to school in 1983 except for her.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also contended that it was not only <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span>
who harbored ill-feelings toward the accused but also the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
in-laws, particularly Maria <span class="SpellE">Hortal</span>, the aunt to whom <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> reported the alleged rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>alleged that the complaint was filed at
the instance of <span class="SpellE">Hortal</span> who wanted to sell the
property upon which stands the house of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
family.</p>

<p class="BODY">These contentions are without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged motives set-up by the appellant <span class="GramE">are</span> not enough to compel the complainant and her relatives
to charge the complainant's father of the heinous crime of rape and on six
counts at that.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held in the case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span></u>
(126 SCRA 425, 436):</p>

<blockquote>“xxx It is unthinkable that an unmarried
teenager would endure the embarrassment and humiliation of a public disclosure
that she had been ravished, allow an exami<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">nation
of her private parts and undergo the ordeal and expense of a court proceed­ing,
if such indeed were not true xxx." <span class="GramE">(See also People v. <span class="SpellE">Ibal</span>, G.R. No. 66010-­12, July 31, 1986; People v. <span class="SpellE">Garcines</span>; 57 SCRA 653; People v. <span class="SpellE">Cawili</span>,
65 SCRA 24).</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the records, we find that the complain­ant has no motive other
than to bring to justice the culprit who had grievously wronged her, it being
harder on her part to do so because it was her very own father who violated her
honor.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has long been held that no young Filipina of decent repute
would publicly admit that she had been criminally abused and ravished unless
that is the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is her natural
instinct to protect her honor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People
v. <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, G.R. No. 52230, December 15, 1986; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, <u>supra</u>; People v. <span class="SpellE">Gamez</span>, 124 SCRA 260; People v. <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span>,
109 Phil. 912; and People v. <span class="SpellE">Gan</span>, 46 SCRA 667).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the record to indicate
that this rule does not apply to <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it is a well-settled rule that appellate courts will
generally not disturb the factual findings of the trial court considering that
it is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses
themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testify­ing during the
trial, unless the court has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and
value that, if considered, might affect the result of the case (People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcid</span>, 135 SCRA 280; People v. <span class="SpellE">Macayan</span>,

People v. <span class="SpellE">Ibal</span> <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully reviewed the records of the case and we also
find no reason to depart from this established rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court evaluated the credibility of the complainant <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> Cruz as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At the time of the commission of Rape, <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span>
was only fifteen years old and full of innocence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she testified in Court, she talked
freely, voluntarily and straight-forward in recalling how she was abused by her
own flesh and blood - <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">her father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her sincerity and candor proved the
commission of Rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was consistent
in her answers and at one time shed tears and was ashamed of what had happened
to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ordeal was too much for
her." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 18).</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rosemi's</span> testimony was corroborated by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">her </span>8-year old sister, Mary Jane.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the trial court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> She
testified she saw her father on top of Ate <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span>
several times fully naked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and that <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> was crying when father was on her top and she could
not help be</span>cause she was afraid that her father might spank her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified on redirect examination that
they were running after each other outside the mosquito net.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified in a straightforward manner of
testimony, sincere and full of candor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This likewise proved the commission of the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified on cross-examination that
despite the fact that all were awakened, her father rode on her sister <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> and that her brothers and sisters watched.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That she saw her father on top of <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> and at the same time hit her sister in the abdomen
and chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A girl only eight (8) years
old will not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">tell a lie.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the Court asked her </span>questions,
she immediately answered and gave examples to meanings asked of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was full of innocence and when answering
questions she was straight and was direct to the point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At her age she will not falsely testify
against her father, the most is <span class="GramE">protect</span> the honor and
integrity of her father but she did otherwise." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 21).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant questions the absence of evidence showing that the
complainant suffered physical injuries from the force allegedly applied on her.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> Although
the medical certificate did not contain any indication whatsoever of physical
injuries (Rec., p. 34; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "<span class="GramE">H";
<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "I") the same does not in any
manner refute much less disprove that physical force was employed by appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in satisfying his bestial desires.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is well to note that the physical
examination was conducted two days after the victim was last abused, thereby
allow­ing any physical injuries to have healed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">or disappeared by the time of the examination.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In any event, the testimony of complainant that she was boxed
by appel­lant, is credible even if no external injury was visible (People v. <span class="SpellE">Budon</span>, 143 SCRA 251 (1986), more so in view of the
testimony of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her </span>sister Mary
Jane who stated that the victim was crying when she saw her father on top of <span class="SpellE">Rosemi</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 1984, p.
7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, actual force or
intimidation need not be employed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">for
rape to be committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The overpowering
influence of a father over his daughter suffices (People v. <span class="SpellE">Erardo</span>,
127 SCRA 256 (1984).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such being the
case, therefore, the absence of any physical injuries cannot negate the
allegation that complainant was forcibly raped much less destroy complainant's
testimony of how she was raped." <span class="GramE">(Brief for the <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, pp. 13­-14).</span></span><span style="font-size:

(125 SCRA 250, 256):</p>

<blockquote>"One should not expect a fourteen-year old girl to act like an
adult or mature and experienced woman who would know what to do under such
difficult circumstances and who would have the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">courage and intelligence to disregard a threat on her life and the
members of her family and complain immediately that she had been forcibly
deflowered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not uncommon for young
girls to conceal for sometime the assaults on their virtue because of the
rapists’ threat on the lives, xxx." <span class="GramE">(See also People v.

December 6, 1986 addressed to her father shows that she is now happily married
to a good man and she has forgiven him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

no evidence in the letter to indicate that the appellant did not commit the
crime for which he was convicted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
merely indicates the bigness of heart of the daughter who, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of the horrible experience she suffered at the hands of her drunken and
perverted father, can still forgive him and, at the same time, show concern for
the other innocent victims of this family tragedy.</p>
