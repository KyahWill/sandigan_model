<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In its decision, the CA
held that the two periods provided for in Section 384 are mandatory and must
always concur.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court argues
that no claim will prosper even if a notice of claim is filed within six (6)
months from the date of the accident if the action in court is </span>filed
more than one year <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither will an action filed within one year
from the date of the accident prosper, if no claim was filed with the insurer
within six (6) months from the said accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The CA then concluded that since the complaint was filed only after
almost seventeen (17) months from the date of the accident, petitioner's cause
of action had prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span>
contends that the finding of respondent court that its cause of action had
prescribed is erroneous since the one-year prescriptive period under Section
384 of the Insurance Code is counted not from the date of the accident but from
the date of the rejection of the claim by the insurer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further argues that even assuming
that the one-year prescriptive period should be counted from the date of the
accident, the running of the period of prescription was interrupted when
petitioner filed a notice of claim with respondent insurance company since
under the Civil Code an extra-­judicial demand is sufficient to interrupt the
running of the prescriptive period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requirement that any claim or action for recovery of damage
under an insurance policy must be brought within one year from the date of the

evidence as to the origin and cause of destruction have not yet disappeared <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">[See </span><span class="SpellE">Ang</span> v.

make proper assessment of whether or not the insured can recover and, if so, to
determine the amount recoverable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, where, as in this case, the delay in bringing the suit against
the insurance company was not caused by the insured or its <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
but by the insurance company itself, it is unfair to penalize the insured or
its <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> by dismissing its action against the
insurance company on the ground of prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter should bear the consequences of
its failure to act promptly on the insured's claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the law, insurance companies are duty
bound to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt, fair and
equitable settlement of claims [Section 241, Insurance Code.]</p>
