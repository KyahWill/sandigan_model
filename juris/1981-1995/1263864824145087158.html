				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court gave due course to this petition and required the
parties to submit simultaneous memoranda for a full exposition of the issues in
their long drawn-out dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have
read their respective pleadings in the light of the challenged decision and are
ready to decide the case once and for all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are simple enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> had since 1949
occupied Apartment No. 3 of a 4-door apartment building used for commercial
purposes, paying a monthly rental of P200.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He managed a tailoring business there, employing several tailors and
seamstresses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In 1974, the private respondent, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>,
who was occupying the first 2 apartments, bought the entire building and
requested <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> to transfer to Apartment No. 4 so <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> could also occupy the third apartment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> agreed, allegedly on the assurance given him by <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> that he and his wife could continue with their
lease during the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> lifetime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Sometime later, <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> allowed <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>,
on his request, to construct a temporary residential structure on the lot
behind Apartment No. 4, also belonging to <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>,
provided that the petitioner would leave the land any time he was required to
do so.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> admits that <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> did
not charge any rentals for this lot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In 1977, <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>
to vacate the apartment and the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> claims <span class="SpellE">Quiambao's</span> reason
was his need for the apartment although <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> says
this was only secondary, as the principal ground was the expiration of the
monthly lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>
refused, invoking <span class="SpellE">Quiambao's</span> promise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Written demand was then made on him by <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>, followed by a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
when the defendant refused to leave.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> won in the Municipal Circuit
Court of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>
was required to vacate the subject premises.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> appealed to the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Capas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, which, while
inferentially holding that the petitioner could be ejected from the apartment,
ordered <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> to execute a new contract with <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> for a period of two years over the lot where <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> had built his house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Not satisfied with this judgment, <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> filed a
petition for <i><u style="text-underline:words">certiorari</u></i> with the
respondent court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and asked that the complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> be
dismissed altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
court set aside the judgment of the regional trial court and virtually
reinstated the decision of the municipal court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision
of the respondent court read:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>appealed
judgment is hereby set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judgment
is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) ordering the petitioner to vacate Apartment No. 4;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) ordering the petitioner to vacate the lot or portion thereof in
which he had erected his temporary dwelling within sixty (60) days from
finality of judgment;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) authorizing the private respondent to remove/demolish the said
structure should the petitioner fail to remove his temporary dwelling within
the above period of sixty (60) days from finality of judgment.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the petition now before us, <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>
asks for the reversal of this decision on the principal ground that there was
no valid reason for the termination of his lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claims that <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>
first said in his complaint that he needed the premises in question, and it was
only later that he argued that his reason for the complaint was the expiration
of the lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second ground had not
been invoked earlier and so may not be pleaded on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> also
contends that the law applied in the case of <span class="SpellE">Salaria</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Buenviaje</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which he said rejected the need for the premises as a valid reason for the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the lessee, was Article 1673 of the Civil
Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This provision is applicable to
both residential and commercial leases.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, the private respondent maintains that he pleaded
both expiration of the term and the need for the premises in the lower courts,
stressing that under the Rules of Court the complaint is limited only to the
ultimate facts and should not contain all the legal arguments and conclusions
of the pleader.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, he
insists, the leased premises are admittedly commercial in nature and so is not
governed by Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
25, which prohibits <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> for expiration of the
term from <u>residential</u> buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the premises have been established to be commercial in nature, the
lease is deemed to have expired in accordance with Article 1687 of the Civil
Code, providing thus -</p>

<blockquote>ART. 1687.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the period for
the lease has not been fixed, it is understood to be from year to year, if the
rent agreed upon is annual; from month to month, if it is monthly; from week to
week, if the rent is weekly; and from day to day, if the rent is to be paid
daily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, even though a monthly
rent is paid, and no period for the lease has been set, the courts may fix a
longer term for the lease after the lessee has occupied the premises for over
one year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the rent is weekly, the
courts may likewise determine a longer period after the lessee has been in
possession for over six months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case
of daily rent, the courts may also fix a longer period after the lessee has
stayed in the place for over one month.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We hold for the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the lease of the disputed apartment is
from month to month, considering the monthly payments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it was terminable at the end of each
month at the option of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, conformably to
Article 1673, also invoked by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 1673.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> may judicially eject the lessee for any of the
following causes:<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) When the period agreed upon, or that which is fixed for the
duration of leases under articles 1682 and 1687, has expired;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Lack of payment<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>of the
price stipulated;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) Violation of any of the conditions agreed upon in the contract;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) When the lessee devotes the thing leased to any use or service
not stipulated which causes the deterioration thereof; or if he does not
observe the requirement in No. 2 of article 1657, as regards the use thereof.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of tenants of agricultural
lands is governed by special laws.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Salaria</span> case is clearly not
applicable because it dealt with residential land, unlike the property subject
of this case which was admittedly commercial in nature, conformably to Morales
v. <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was held:</p>

<blockquote>When a barber or tailor pursues his calling by serving customers in
his dwelling, he is merely exercising a home industry; engaging other tailors
or barbers to expand his business and increase his returns, his establishment
becomes commercial and the incidental fact that his family lives therein does
not include him in that class of tenants equally favored by recent emergency
legislation on housing.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 does not cover commercial lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged promise of <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> that he
would allow <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> to remain in the leased premises
during the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> lifetime has not been clearly
established.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, though, that the lot on which <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span>
house is located was never the subject of a lease and was occupied by him only
on <span class="SpellE">Quiambao's</span> tolerance and subject to its return any
time it was needed by the owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, he was allowed to build thereon only a temporary shelter and
not the permanent structure he erected at the alleged cost of P15,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner never specifically denied
these allegations in the complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and
is therefore deemed to have admitted them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> can therefore not insist that he is a builder in
good faith or demand payment for the improvements he has constructed, nor may
he retain the same until reimbursement is made.</p>

<p class="BODY">In raising all the procedural objections that have considerably
delayed the disposition of this case, the petitioner has impeded rather than
promoted the orderly administration of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By his clever maneuvers, he has suppressed the truth and prevented its
early discovery, thus managing to remain unlawfully in the disputed premises
all these years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The essential facts of
this case cannot be denied despite the petitioner's deplorable attempt to
conceal them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His lease has expired over
Apartment No. 4 nor can he claim a lease over the lot behind it, which means
that he should have vacated the disputed premises long ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion, supported by the evidence
and demanded by the law, cannot be deferred much longer to the private
respondent’s prejudice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is time we
wrote finis to this case, as we do so now.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED and the decision of the
respondent court AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, with
costs against the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
decision is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
