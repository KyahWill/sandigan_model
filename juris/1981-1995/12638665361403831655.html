				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1968</st1:date>,
petitioner Elias V. <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> was appointed by the then
Mayor Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> of <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
as City Attorney of the said city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1971</st1:date>, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> was charged with murder in the Court of First
Instance of General Santos City and was detained without bail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few months later, on <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1971</st1:date>, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span>
ran for and was reelected as City Mayor of General Santos City pending the criminal
case against him and even while he was in jail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1972</st1:date>,
Mayor <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> issued Administrative Order No. 1
designating Vice Mayor <span class="SpellE">Erlindo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>Acting
Mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1972</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span>, while
still in prison, issued another memorandum which had the effect of revoking the
aforementioned <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1972</st1:date>
memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> filed two cases
with the Supreme Court challenging the authority of Acting Mayor <span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span> to act <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>such,
claiming that notwithstanding the fact that he was confined as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>detention prisoner due to the
murder charge against him, <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> may lawfully
discharge the duties and functions of the Office of the Mayor of General Santos
City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both petitions, <u>City</u> <u>of</u>
<u>General</u> <u>Santos</u> <u>and</u> <u>Hon.</u> <u>Antonio</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Acharon</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Atty.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Erlindo</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Grafilo</u></span><u>,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al</u>., G.R. No.
35303 and <u>Antonio</u> <u>C.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Acharon</u></span> <u>v.</u>
<u>Pedro</u> <u>Samson</u> <u>C.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Anomas</u></span><u>,</u>
<u>et</u> <u>al.</u>, G.R. No. L-33835, were dismissed by the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court, in a Resolution dated October 20,
1972 stated that "the continued detention of . . . Antonio <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> in jail, pending hearing and determination of his
case of murder, for which he has been denied bail, constitutes temporary
incapacity to discharge the duties of his Office of Mayor of General Santos
City, under Section 17 of Republic Act No. 6388 which incapacity justifies the
assumption of the Office of Mayor by respondent Vice-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Erlindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span> . . ." [City of General Santos and Hon.
Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span> v. Atty. <span class="SpellE">Erlindo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span>, et al., G.R. No. L-35303, <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1972</st1:date>.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, acting Mayor <span class="SpellE">Erlindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span> suspended petitioner Elias V. <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span>
as City Attorney for a period of ten (10) days effective <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1972</st1:date>,
notice was served on petitioner that he had been removed as the City Attorney
of General Santos City on the ground of loss of confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ostensibly, the Acting Mayor's loss of
confidence in petitioner was the result of the legal opinion of the latter
impugning the authority of Acting Mayor <span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span> to
act as such and upholding the authority of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Acharon</span>
to discharge the functions of the Office of the Mayor even while the latter was
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>prison.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the Civil Service Commission the
termination of his services as City Attorney.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Acting Commissioner on Civil Service in an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1972</st1:date>
directed Acting Mayor <span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span> to allow Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> to continue in service as City Attorney pending
resolution of the merits of his appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Acting Mayor <span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span> disregarded the directive
of the Civil Service Commissioner branding the same as an illegal order and
contrary to the Supreme Court decisions in <u>Claudio</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Subido</u></span>, 40 SCRA 481 and <span class="SpellE"><u>Besa</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <u>PNB</u>, 33 SCRA 330.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1972</st1:date>, Acting Mayor <span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span> appointed Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Polistico</span> as City Attorney of General Santos City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1972</st1:date>,
petitioner filed with the City Treasurer of General Santos City a claim for the
payment of his back salaries in the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,275.00</span>
corresponding to the period from July 11 to <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1972</st1:date> invoking in support of his claim the
aforementioned directive of the Commission on Civil Service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's voucher was forwarded by
respondent City Treasurer to respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">City
</span>Auditor who in turn referred the same to the Auditor General in an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="10">October
 26, 1972</st1:date> for decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Auditor General referred the claim to the Office of the President for
opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On February 18, 1974, the
respondent Assistant Executive Secretary, by Authority of the President,
rendered an opinion stating that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
the termination of petitioner's services as City Attorney by Acting Mayor <span class="SpellE">Grafilo</span> was in accordance with law and; (2) Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacete</span> may not rightfully demand payment of back salaries
for the period during which he was out of the service and was physically and
legally not discharging his duties as City Attorney of General Santos City
[Annex "I" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 64.]
Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by respondent
Assistant Executive Secretary on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="7">July
 8, 1974</st1:date> [Annex "J" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 72.] On <st1:date year="1974" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1974</st1:date>,
the Commission on Audit, which by virtue of the 1973 Constitution took over the
powers and functions of the Auditor General, rendered a decision disallowing
petitioner's claim for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, respondent City Auditor Miguel <span class="SpellE">Penalosa</span>, Jr. refused to pass in audit petitioner's claim
for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> [Annex "R" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 103.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1974</st1:date>,
petitioner filed the present petition with essentially the following
prayers:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the time petitioner was suspended on <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1972</st1:date> until the final
termination of this case; and (2) payment by respondent City Auditor Miguel <span class="SpellE">Penalosa</span>, Jr. of damages for his refusal to pass in audit
petitioner's claim for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner did not pray for reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the filing by the parties of their respective pleadings,
the Court, through its Second Division, resolved on <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1975</st1:date>, to consider the case submitted for
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, no action was
taken thereon until after the reorganization of the Court upon the ratification
of the 1987 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 8, 1988, the Court, noting the considerable length of
time during which the case has been pending and to determine whether
supervening events have rendered the case moot and academic required the
parties to move in the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">respondents</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Auditor and City Treasurer of
General Santos City filed a manifestation claiming that the case has become
moot and academic because petitioner has been appointed Hearing Officer IV of
the National Police Commission on <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="2">February
 25, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
the Solicitor General filed a manifestation stating that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">is </span>no showing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>the
parties have lost interest in the case; and (2) there is no supervening event
which would render the case moot and academic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, petitioner filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>manifestation
underscoring his interest in pursuing the case and reiterating his claims for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner first assails the legality of the opinion of
respondent Assistant Executive Secretary contending that the decision of the
Auditor General cannot be reviewed by the Office of the President without
violating the principles of separation of powers and non-delegation of powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is unmeritorious because the Office of the
President did not review the ruling of the Auditor General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, what transpired was the referral of
petitioner's case by the Auditor General to the Office of the President for
opinion, on the basis of which the respondent Acting Chairman of the Commission
on Audit, who <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>noted earlier
took over the functions of the Auditor General, rendered a decision disallowing
petitioner's claim [Annex "K" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 102.] In other words, the respondent Acting Chairman of the Commission on
Audit did issue a separate decision rejecting petitioner's money claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot, therefore be claimed that the
Commission on Audit (formerly the Auditor General) abdicated in favor of the
Office of the President its authority over cases involving the settlement of
accounts or money claims against the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner next contends that the failure of the Auditor General
to decide his claim within sixty (60) days from the presentation of the same
resulted in the automatic grant of petitioner's claim for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
in accordance with Sec. 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 327.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is bereft of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 1 of Commonwealth Act No. 327 provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Section 1.</span> In all cases involving the
settlement of accounts or claims, other than those of <span class="GramE">accountable</span>
officers, the Auditor General shall act and decide the same within sixty (60)
days, exclusive of Sundays and holidays, after their presentation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Carabao</u></span><u>,</u> <u>Inc.</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Agricultural</u>
<u>Productivity</u> <u>Commission</u>, G.R. No.</span> L-29304, September 30,
1970, 35 SCRA 224, the Court held that in case of failure by the Auditor
General to decide a claim within sixty (60) days, a claimant's remedy is to
institute <i>mandamus</i> proceedings to compel the rendition of a<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>decision by the Auditor General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lapse of the sixty (60) day period does
not result in the automatic grant of the claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in Commonwealth Act No. 327 can the petitioner's theory of
automatic grant be inferred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having resolved the preliminary issues, the Court will now deal
with petitioner's claim for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> which is
anchored on the legality of the termination of the services of petitioner as
City Attorney of General Santos City, which, in turn, hinges on the issue of
whether or not the position of City Attorney is confidential, for which loss of
confidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>a valid ground
for termination.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the first time that this question has been raised
before the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Besa</u></span> <u>v</u>. <u>Philippine</u> <u>National</u> <u>Bank</u>,
G.R. No.</span> L-26838, May 29, 1970, 33 SCRA 331, the Court ruled that the
position of Chief Legal Counsel of the Philippine National Bank is both
confidential and technical in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <u>Claudio</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Subido</u></span>,
G.R. No.</span> L-30865, August 31, 1971, 40 SCRA 481, 484, the Court likewise
ruled that "[t]he position in question, that of the City Legal Officer, is
one that requires the utmost confidence on the part of the Mayor."</p>

<p class="BODY">The same conclusion was reached by the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cadiente</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Santos</u>, G.R. No. L-35592,
June 11, 1986, 142 SCRA 280, w<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">here </span>petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Cadiente</span> was discharged as the City Legal Officer of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City by the newly elected mayor on the ground that
the position was primarily confidential in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In upholding <span class="SpellE">Cadiente's</span>
termination, the Court stated the following:</p>

<blockquote>In resolving the merits of the instant case, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find as an undeniable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">fact </span>that
the position of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>City Legal
Officer is one which is "primarily confidential".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court held in the case of Claudio vs. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, L-30865, August 31, 1971, 40 SCRA 481, that the
position of a City Legal Officer is one requiring that utmost confidence on the
part of the mayor be extended to said officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The relationship existing between a lawyer and his client, whether a
private individual or a public officer, is one that depends on the highest
degree of trust that the latter entertains for the counsel selected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the case of <span class="SpellE">Pinero</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span>, L-22562, October 22, 1966, 18 SCRA
4176 (citing De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>,
87 Phil. 289), the phrase ‘primarily confidential’ "denotes not only
confidence in the aptitude of the appointee for the duties of the office but
primarily close intimacy which insures freedom of intercourse, without
embarrassment on freedom from misgivings of betrayals of personal trust on
confidential matters of state." (Italics supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The tenure of officials holding primarily confidential positions
ends upon loss of confidence, because their term of office lasts only as long
as confidence in them endures; and thus their cessation involves no removal
(Corpus vs. <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>, L-23721, March 31, 1965, 13
SCRA 591-596).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When such confidence is
lost and the officer holding such position is separated from the service, such
cessation entails no removal but an expiration of his term.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Hernandez vs. Villegas,
L-17287, <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1965</st1:date>, 14
SCRA 548, it was held -<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">It is to be understood of course that officials and employees
holding primarily confidential positions continue only for so long as
confidence in them endures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
termination of their official relation can be justified on the ground of loss
of confidence because in that case their cessation from office involved no
removal but merely the expiration of the term of office - two different causes
for the termination of official relations recognized in the Law of Public
Officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, after a careful consideration of the instant case,
finds no cogent reason to depart from the ruling of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
cases that the position of Legal Counsel or City Attorney is confidential in
nature, for which loss of confidence is a valid ground for termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Court must rule that petitioner is
not entitled to the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> claimed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, having determined the legality of
petitioner's termination from service as City Attorney, the Court must likewise
hold that respondent City Auditor Miguel <span class="SpellE">Penalosa</span>,
Jr. cannot be held liable for damages since his refusal to pass in audit
petitioner's claim for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> was pursuant to a
lawful order made by the respondent Acting Commissioner on Audit.</p>
