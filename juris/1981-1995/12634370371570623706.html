and Cañizares guilty of murder, and as well convicted Orehuela of qualified
illegal possession of firearm and ammunition.  The dispositive portion of the Joint Decision<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> dated

<p class="BODY">On the charge of murder, the prosecution relied principally on
testimonial evidence.  The prosecution
presented four (4) witnesses:  namely,
Rosalina Cañizares, widow of the deceased victim; Teofilo Marimon, a resident
of Tomoc, San Miguel, Province of Bohol; P/Cpl. Jovino Nunez; and Bonifacio
Ayag, a National Bureau of Investigation ("NBI") Ballistics
Technician.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, as presented by the prosecution, may be
culled from the testimony of the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><u><span style="">Rosalina Cañizares</span></u><span style=""> </span>testified
that on the <span style="">evening </span>of 29
January 1989, she and her husband, Teoberto Cañizares, lodged for the night at
the house of their neighbor Elias Cañizares, to help nurse a sick child.  At around 7:30 o'clock in the evening,
Rosalina and Teoberto heard their dogs barking persistently.  The couple returned to their own house, some
twenty (20) meters away from Elias Cañizares' home.  Finding no apparent cause for their dogs' behavior, Teoberto and
Rosalina decided to return to their neighbor Elias' house.  Rosalina recalled that she walked ahead of
her husband who, at the last moment, decided to take a last look and returned
to their own house.  When Rosalina
reached Elias' house, she heard two (2) gunshots in quick succession.  She then heard her husband crying for help,
evidently in pain.  She rushed out of
Elias' house, with a lamp on hand.  Upon
reaching their own house, Rosalina saw her Teoberto sprawled on the floor, dead.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Teofilo Marimon</u> recalled that as he passed by the house of
Teoberto Cañizares on his way to the house of Elias Cañizares to attend to the
sick child, he noticed that the window panels in the house of Teoberto were
drawn wide open.  There was a light inside
the house, and Teofilo saw Teoberto inside.  Teofilo also observed that there was a man standing outside the window
holding a gun and aiming it at Teoberto Cañizares.  Teofilo recognized the man wielding the gun to be appellant
Orehuela.  Teofilo testified that he was
approximately ten (10) meters away from Teoberto's house as he observed the
foregoing.  Then he heard two (2)
gunshots fired.  Teofilo ran and hid
himself in some bushes approximately twenty (20) meters away from Teoberto's
house.  While hiding among the bushes,
Teofilo soon saw three (3) persons hurriedly walking, one after the other, away
from Teoberto's house.  Teofilo did not
recognize the first man who apparently was not from Tomoc, San Miguel, Bohol;
however, he saw and recognized clearly the faces of Orehuela and Anecito
Cañizares, both of whom had resided for a long time in the same town that
Teofilo lived in; Orehuela, with a flashlight and a handgun followed the
unidentified person, while Anecito Cañizares made up the rear.  Teofilo did not rush out of hiding as soon
as the three (3) persons had gone by, but rather waited in the bushes for
sometime.  The following day, Teofilo
Marimon learned that Teoberto <span style="">Cañizares
had been shot to death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>P/Cpl. Jovino Nuñez</u> stated on the witness stand that he
had learned of the slaying of Teoberto Cañizares on the day following the
shooting, from Elias Cañizares and one Marciano Orilla.  P/Cpl. Nuñez immediately went to the
deceased's house.  There he found that
the victim had sustained two (2) gunshot wounds.  He also recovered the slug of a bullet from a wall of the house
of the victim Teoberto, and brought the slug to Cebu City for ballistic
examination.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Bonifacio Ayag</u>, an NBI ballistician, conducted the
ballistic examination on the slug recovered from the wall of the victim's
house.  He testified that the slug was a
caliber .38 copper lead bullet fired through the barrel of a .38 caliber
firearm, the rifling of which "inclined to the right."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants controverted the prosecution's version of the
events of that tragic night.  Each of
the appellants disclaimed any participation in, or knowledge of, the
circumstances surrounding the murder with which they were charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Orehuela principally asserted that, at about 7:30
o'clock in the evening of 29 January 1989, he was in his house in Sitio
Ligid-Ligid, San Carlos, Danao, Bohol, some twenty-five (25) kilometers away
from Tomoc, San Miguel, Bohol.  He was
celebrating his first wedding anniversary with friends.  He testified that it was not possible for
him to have been at the scene of the crime, considering that no road connected
Tomoc and Ligid-Ligid which was passable by motor vehicles.  A journey from Ligid­-Ligid to Tomoc had to
be made on foot and would take about three (3) to four (4) hours.  Orehuela's statement that he was in
Ligid-Ligid celebrating at the time Teoberto Cañizares was slain, was
corroborated by two (2) defense witnesses.  The first, Camilo Persegas, testified that there was indeed a
celebration on 29 January 1989 which many people attended.  Persegas declared that he slept in appellant
Orehuela's house that night and had breakfast with him the next morning.  The second defense witness testified that he
too was at Orehuela's wedding anniversary celebration.  There, he saw Camilo Persegas and several
other people naming them; he, however, left the party at around 7:00 o'clock in
the evening.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Anecito Cañizares, for his part, testified that he had
left Tomoc on 27 January 1989 for Katipunan, Bohol to work in his fields.  The distance from Tomoc to Katipunan,
approximately thirty (30) kilometers, was negotiated by Anecito Cañizares on
foot and the journey took him the whole morning.  On the 29th of January 1989, he went to see one Aniana Butil to
request help from her sons in working the landholding of Anecito.  He learned about the death of Teoberto
Cañizares, his second cousin, only on the next day.  Anecito returned to Tomoc on foot on 31 January 1989 and paid his
last respects to the dead Teoberto.  Anecito sought to bolster his story by presenting two (2)
witnesses.  The first, one Leoncio
Matabilas, testified that he was a carpenter working for Anecito Cañizares and
that he had stopped working on Cañizares' house the day before Anecito was
scheduled to leave for Katipunan.  Aniana Butil, a resident of Katipunan, testified that she saw Anecito
Cañizares on 29 January 1989, at around 7:30 in the evening in Katipunan.  Aniana confirmed that Anecito Cañizares had
requested assistance from her sons in working his agricultural landholding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The firmly settled rule is that, in respect of the appraisal of
credibility of witnesses, the findings of fact of the trial judge are to be
accorded great weight and are not to be disturbed, unless the judge had clearly
overlooked facts of substance and value which, if taken into account, would
affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> After
careful examination of the record of this appeal, the Court is unable to find
any compelling reason to depart from this rule insofar as the trial court's
conclusion that Orehuela was guilty of the murder of Teoberto Cañizares is
concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court had accepted as straightforward and worthy of
credence the positive identification by Teofilo Marimon of Orehuela as the
slayer of Teoberto, over the testimonies of appellant Orehuela and his
corroborating witnesses claiming alibi.  Orehuela contended that the testimony of Rosalina Cañizares, widow of
the victim, conflicted with the testimony of Teofilo Marimon, the prosecution's
eye-witness.  Orehuela asserted that
while Marimon had declared that there was light inside the house where Teoberto
Cañizares was fatally shot, Rosalina, upon the other hand, stated that she had
to come back to her neighbor Elias Cañizares to fetch a lamp because it was
dark inside Rosalina's and Teoberto's house.  Orehuela claims that the eye-witness account of Marimon should not have
been accorded any weight or credence by the trial judge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are not
persuaded.  The recollection of
different witnesses with respect to the time and place and other circumstances
of a criminal event would naturally differ in various details.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The inconsistencies adverted to by accused
Orehuela, if inconsistency there was, refer to a detail of circumstance which
did </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">bear upon the basic aspects of the crime.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> At all events, the inconsistency was more
supposed than real:  the light in the
house of Teoberto seen by Teofilo Marimon just </span><u>before</u> <span style="">the firing </span>began, could very well have
been snuffed out promptly upon the shooting, possibly by Teoberto himself as he
cried for help, with the result that by the time Rosalina had reached their
home, it was dark inside the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of Orehuela that Teofilo may have mistaken him for
some other person of similar physical build, does not deserve prolonged
consideration.  That Teofilo Marimon,
from a distance of about ten (10) meters, had observed Orehuela aiming at the
victim, was not successfully rebutted.  The light inside the house, observed through the open windows, had
enabled Teofilo to recognize Orehuela by face.  Orehuela had been Teofilo's friend and barriomate for a considerable
period of time.  Teofilo was himself
familiar with the physical features of Orehuela's <u>persona</u>, which
familiarity facilitated visual identifica­tion.  Moreover, Marimon had a second opportunity to verify his initial
recognition when Orehuela, with flashlight and gun on hand, passed by Marimon
concealed in the bushes at a distance of about one (1) fathom.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court considers that the evidence of the prosecution had
shown beyond reasonable doubt Orehuela's guilt.  He had aimed and fired a pistol at the unsuspecting victim who
sustained fatal gunshot wounds.  The
trial court held that Orehuela's denials were not enough to set at naught the
positive and credible identification of the eye?witness Teofilo
Marimon:  those denials constituted
self-serving negative evidence which can hardly be considered as overcoming the
straightforward and credit-worthy eye-witness account.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">We </span>find no basis for overturning
this conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find too that treachery had been properly appreciated.  The means, method or manner of execution
employed ensured the offender's safety; and such means were consciously chosen
by the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the victim was suddenly and without warning shot by
appellant Orehuela who had stationed himself outside Teoberto's house and thus
incurred no risk to himself.  The means
of attack obviously took the victim by surprise and the latter could not offer
any effective defense or retaliation against the slayer hidden from the
victim's view.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning to the case against appellant Anecito Cañizares, we find
quite a different situation.  After
examination of the evidence submitted against him, we are compelled to conclude
that Anecito's guilt is open to reasonable doubt.  The case of the prosecution against Anecito Cañizares rested
entirely upon the basic premise that Orehuela and Cañizares were
co-conspirators.  On that basis, Anecito
Cañizares was found by the trial court equally liable for the act personally committed
by Orehuela, the physical act, that is, of firing at the victim Teoberto
Cañizares with deadly consequences.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is familiar doctrine that conspiracy, as with any other
ingredient of an offense, must be established not by mere conjecture<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
but by evidence which satisfies the requirement of proof beyond reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">To establish conspiracy, two (2) or more persons must be shown to
have come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony.  It is not, of course, indispensable that
direct proof be adduced to establish the agreement to commit the felony; the
availability of such direct proof of the agreement to commit the felony is, in
the nature of things, clearly the exception rather than the rule.  Conspiracy must commonly be inferred from acts
of the accused which clearly manifest a concurrence of wills, a common intent
or design to commit a crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> In
the great majority of cases, conspiracy is established by proof of acts done in
concert, that is to say, acts which yield the reasonable inference that the
doers thereof were acting with a common intent or design.  Analytically, therefore, the task in every
case is that of determining whether the particular acts established by the
requisite quantum of proof do reasonably yield that inference.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, as noted earlier, Anecito Cañizares, per the
testimony of eye-witness Teofilo Marimon, was seen walking hurriedly away from
the house of the victim, apparently following the John Doe and Modesto
Orehuela.  The eye-witness did <u>not</u>
testify that he saw Anecito Cañizares with Orehuela <u>immediately before or at
the precise time when Orehuela fired at the victim</u>.  No act physically performed by Anecito
Cañizares was perceived and reported by the eye-witness, save only the act of
walking away, in a hurried manner, from the house of the victim.  In other words, no overt act on the part of
Anecito Cañizares was established other then that of leaving the vicinity of
the slaying, apparently following appellant Orehuela and the John Doe.  We must conclude that that act, <u>by itself</u>,
was insufficient to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Anecito Cañizares
was privy to the intent of Orehuela to slay Teoberto Cañizares and that he had
participated in the carrying out of that intent.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> The
only inferences that appear to the Court to have been reasonably established by
the testimony of Teofilo Marimon was that Anecito Cañizares was in the vicinity
or not far away from the house of Teoberto Cañizares at or about the time of
the shooting and that he probably heard the two (2) gunshots and, possibly, the
cries of Teoberto for succor.  But these
inferences, <u>without </u><u><span style="">more</span></u><span style="">, </span>do not adequately establish
participation in a criminal conspiracy.  Our mind and conscience do not rest at ease with the conclusion of the
trial court, based solely thereon, that Anecito had conspired with Orehuela and
an unidentified third man in murdering Teoberto Cañizares.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The failure or inability of the defense to show any ill motive on
the part of Teofilo Marimon to perjure himself and falsely to accuse his friend
Anecito Cañizares of such a grievous crime, does not by itself warrant the
inference that a criminal conspiracy between Modesto Orehuela and Anecito
Cañizares did in fact exist.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> The
testimony of Teofilo Marimon, while sincerely given and truthful and accurate
so far as it went, simply did not encompass the acts of Anecito Cañizares <u><span style="">before</span></u><span style=""> </span>he was seen walking away from the victim's house.  That testimony, in other words, did not by
itself suffice to establish clearly and convincingly a reasonable nexus between
Anecito Cañizares and the fatal shooting of Teoberto by Modesto Orehuela.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are mindful that the testimony of the widow Rosalina Cañizares
tended to establish the existence of a dispute about land boundaries between
the victim Teoberto Cañizares and appellant Anecito Cañizares.  Assuming, however, <u>arguendo</u> only,
that such a dispute had been adequately shown, and assuming further that that
dispute was of a nature sufficiently weighty and serious as to have arguably
led to a resolve on the part of Anecito to kill Teoberto Cañizares, such motive
nevertheless does not dispense with the necessity of proving participation or
acts in concert before a criminal conspiracy may be regarded as established
between specified persons.  Proof of
motive is no substitute for proof of physical acts of participation; motives
are not always or inevitably externalized into actions.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-bottom: 15pt;">Turning to Criminal Case No. 6134
for qualified illegal possession of firearm and ammunition, we observe that the
defense of appellant Orehuela consisted simply of a non-corroborated and
self-serving denial that he had ever possessed a firearm in his entire life.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the other hand, we note also that the allegedly unlicensed murder weapon
was not presented in evidence by the prosecution.  What the prosecution did present to show absence of a license or
permit to possess the firearm used to kill Teoberto, was a certification issued
by the <span style="">Bohol </span>Regional
Headquarters of the Integrated National Police, dated 20 December 1989,
certifying that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x

<blockquote>x x x according to records of this Headquarters, the name of
Modesto Orehuela, does not appear in the list of licensed and/or registered
firearm holders this province as of this date.  Subject Modesto Orehuela was not authorized by this Headquarters to

<blockquote>This certification is issued upon request of Second Assistant

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top: 15pt; text-indent: 0in;">We consider that the
certification was adequate to show that the firearm used by Modesto Orehuela in
killing Teoberto Cañizares was a firearm which Orehuela was not licensed to
possess and to carry outside his residence on the night that Teoberto Cañizares
was shot to death.  That that firearm
was a .38 caliber pistol was shown by the testimony and report of NBI
Ballistician Bonifacio Ayag.  When the
above circumstances are taken together with the testimony of the eye-witness
that Modesto Orehuela was in fact in possession of a firearm and used the same
to kill Teoberto Cañizares, we believe that accused Orehuela was properly found
guilty of aggravated or qualified illegal possession of firearm and ammunition.</p>
