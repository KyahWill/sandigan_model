<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution reveals the following:</p>

<p class="2Q">On August 3, 1987 at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>, a tricycle driver, was on his motorized tricycle
parked <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">"Big Foot" Bar located at East <span class="SpellE">Dirita</span>,
San Antonio</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> near the crossroad of the National Highway
and the road leading to the U.S. Naval Communication Station at San Miguel, San
</span>Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While there, accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, who crossed the road, approached him and
told him "<span class="SpellE">Maykadtoy</span> <span class="SpellE">ta</span>
<span class="SpellE">adda</span> <span class="SpellE">ibelleng</span>", which
in English is "Come here, we shall throw something".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Responding, he went with the accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of the gate of the Guerrero Compound where the
latter's companions were.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From where
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> was parked <span class="SpellE">infront</span>
of the "Big Foot" Bar, the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
companions were about eight (8) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">meters
away across </span>the street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then,
three (3) male persons, as well as accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz boarded the tricycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The three (3) companions of <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz rode inside
the sidecar of the tricycle, while accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz rode in tandem with Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>
on the motorcycle of the tricycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of
his four (4) passengers, only accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz was known to Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>,
having known him for the past three (3) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After boarding the tricycle, the persons inside the sidecar told
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> to bring them to the terminal at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he was later told to proceed to San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> (p. 21, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., November 17, 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While on the way to San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, near the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Elementary
  School</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Beddeng</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> heard the shout in the vernacular, "Array"
and blood spurted from the sidecar and landed on his forearm, as well as on the
steering bar of his motorcycle (p. 30, Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon hearing this, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> stopped
his tricycle and one of the passengers in the sidecar, who was bloodied, was brought
out from the tricycle by the other two (2) passengers in the sidecar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once on the ground, the two (2) passengers
mauled the bloodied passenger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later,
they threw him by the roadside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
this was going on, accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz was standing behind Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, the accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and the two (2) unidentified persons
boarded the tricycle and <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz directed Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> to bring them to his
(<span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruzâ€™) place
(p. 26, Ibid), leaving behind the bloodied person, whom the two (2)
unidentified companions of <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz threw away by the roadside, <span class="SpellE">infront</span>
of the <span class="SpellE">Beddeng</span> Elementary School.</p>

<p class="2Q">In going to the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz directed Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>
to pass through the alley behind the Mini Mart, instead of passing through the
checkpoint at the road leading to the U.S. Naval Communication Station, and
exited into the road going to the Base (p. 28, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
November 17, 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival at the
house of accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz, the two (2) unidentified passengers alighted from the tricycle and
accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz
washed away the blood from the steering bar and inside the sidecar with water
in a pail, using a rag, which he got from his neighbor (p. 30, Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And while accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz was washing the tricycle, the two (2)
persons went behind the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz where the wound of one of them was treated by
them (p. 33, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., supra).</p>

<p class="2Q">Later, after washing the tricycle, accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz gave Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>
the amount of P7.00 and the latter went home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because he was afraid, he did not report the incident to the
police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, five (5) days later, he
was arrested by the police and was investigated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He gave his statement to the police narrating
the incident that occurred in the evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1987</st1:date> (Exhibit "C").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And it was after his arrest that he learned
from the father of the slain man that the latter's name was Jerry <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">The following morning at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00

of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Beddeng</span>, San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Zambales</span></span>
reported to the Station Commander of the police station of San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> his discovery
of the dead body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In turn, the Station
Commander, P/Lt. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, dispatched Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Arsenio</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">Agawin</span> and Pat.</span> Salvador <span class="SpellE">Wagma</span>,
to the place where the body was found.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Taking the mini-bus, the two (2) peace officers arrived at the scene <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Beddeng-Mabangcal</span>
Elementary School at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Beddeng</span>,
San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> at
about 6:30 a.m. where they came upon P/Lt. <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">FariÃ±as</span> viewing the dead body of a person, who was wearing
a red undershirt (<span class="SpellE">sando</span> and a white pant, bloodied
and lying flat on his stomach on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lt. <span class="SpellE">FariÃ±as</span> then gave the wallet, which he
took from the pocket of the dead person's pants, to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Agawin</span></span><span class="GramE">, which contained an I.D.
with a name "Jerry Reyes" (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
January 12, 1988).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
the body was transported to the police station of San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the same date in the morning, Dr. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Braga</span>, the
Rural Health Physician of the San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Rural

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">which</span> injuries
caused the <span class="SpellE">cardiorespiratory</span> arrest, and
consequently, caused the death of said person, identified through his wallet as
"Jerry Reyes" (Exhibit "B").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Braga</span> issued a
death certificate (Exhibit "A").</p>

<p class="2Q">In the meantime, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>, who
last saw his son at his house in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1987</st1:date> was informed by his wife that his
father who lives at <span class="SpellE">Iba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
has told her that their son had been missing for three (3) days already.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, somehow, on <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1987</st1:date>, by a stroke of Fate, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>' brother-in-law, a tricycle driver, was told by a
woman <span class="SpellE">traveller</span> from San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> that a dead body was found in San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> (p. 20, Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Reacting to this information, he and his wife went to San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 p.m.</st1:time>
on <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1987</st1:date> (p. 20,
Ibid) and talked to the Chief of Police (Station Commander) of the San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> INP.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
the cadaver of their son was already buried, they and the police chief were
able to identify the deceased as their son, through the latter's picture they
brought (<span class="SpellE">Exhibi</span> "E-1") and the wallet,
which contained an ID card showing the name "Jerry Reyes".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deceased was using the family name of his
mother, "Reyes", because <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span> is long
and cannot be contained in the identification card.</p>

<p class="2Q">Upon learning that their son was already buried, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>, Sr. talked to his wife and they agreed that the
body of their son should be exhumed to determine if it was really their son's
body that was buried <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">by </span>the
police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1987</st1:date>, witnessed by the policemen of San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, the security
men of the Martin Funeral Parlor, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>,
Sr. exhumed the body of his son, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>,
Jr. alias "Jerry R. Reyes".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the coffin was opened, he <span class="SpellE">indentified</span> the
body as that of his son through the growth at the tip of the ear, the rotten
front teeth, the Red T-shirt his son was wearing when he saw him for the last
time and the shoes his son was wearing, which belonged to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also identified the body in the coffin
because of the similarity of his and that of his son's facial features.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, a photograph of the dead body of his
son inside the coffin was taken (Exhibit "E").</p>

<p class="2Q">Because the sister of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>'
wife was buried at <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Subic</span></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, and his wife wanted their son buried there, the
remains of his son was re-buried at <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Subic</span></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
the burial services, he spent P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> (Exhibit
"C") and P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">3</span>,000.00 for
expenses in the exhumation and for the nine (9) days prayer which are not supported

<p class="BODY">The version of the accused, on the other hand, is as follo<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ws:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">On the other hand, as claimed by accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, he knows prosecution witness Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> and are friends (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
April 5, 1988) and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> drives a
tricycle whose route <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">i</span>s from the
town proper of San Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> to the gate of
the U.S. Naval Communications Facility at San Miguel, San Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>; that at about 10:00 o'clock in the evening on
August 3, 1987, he was standing <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of his
cousin's store located at the intersection of the National Highway and the road
leading to the U.S. Naval Communication Facility, known locally as
"crossing".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was there
because he paid his indebtedness.</p>

<p class="2Q">While standing <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of his cousin's
store at <st1:place>West <span class="SpellE">Dirita</span></st1:place>, a man,
who came from the direction of the Holiday Inn (p. 14, <span class="GramE">Ibid)</span>
approached him and offered him a bottle of beer, he was holding, but, he
refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then asked for his name and
the man gave his name as Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span>
asked him if he knew somebody who could bring someone to San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And he
replied he knew a driver named Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>,
whose tricycle was parked across the street <span class="SpellE">infront</span>
of the "Big Foot" Bar and he called Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>,
telling him he had a passenger (pp. 10-11, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">caling</span>
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>, the latter and Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> talked to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>
asked him to accompany him in bringing his passengers to San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> and he acceded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Domingo <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> talked to him, he was
alone and did not know he had companions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, when Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> boarded the
tricycle, two (2) others also boarded the tricycle (p. 24, Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of the three (3) passengers, two were
tall.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span>
was the tallest, while the third passenger was the smallest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter wore short pants and a red
T-shirt.</p>

<p class="2Q">On the way to San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, a commotion among passengers ensued inside the
sidecar of the tricycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>, the driver, then stopped his tricycle and the
three (3) passengers, including Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span>
inside the sidecar alighted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, the
three (3) passengers had a free-for-all fight on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He noticed that Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span>
was already bloodied but the deceased was not yet bloodied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, all of a sudden, he saw Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> holding a glittering object, swinging it towards
the shortest man in the group and the latter fell on the right side of the road
just <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Beddeng-Mabangcal</span>
Elementary School about four (4) meters from the tricycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then told the tricycle driver, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>, to leave the passengers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, the tricycle driver maneuvered his
tricycle in order to leave his passengers in the sidecar, but Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> and his companion held the baggage rack (<span class="SpellE">parilla</span>) of the tricycle and boarded the tricycle.</p>

<p class="2Q">After coming from San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> drove the tricycle to his (<span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz) house at West <span class="SpellE">Dirita</span>,
which is about one (1) kilometer from the National Highway, because Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> told him, after coming from San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, that he would bring him home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, instead of passing through the access
road leading to the U.S. Naval Communication Facility and the checkpoint, they
passed behind the Mini-Mart and exited into the road going to the Base Upon
arrival <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz if he could wash his hands at his gate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And after Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span>
and his companion had finished washing the tricycle of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>, they left (p. 21, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
April 5, 1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, he went inside his
house; that he did not voluntarily wash the blood from the sidecar of the
tricycle of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> and he was threatened
with death by Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> if he would report the
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That was why he did not report
the incident (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., April 5, 1988).</p>

<p class="2Q">To corroborate the claim of <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz that he did not wash the tricycle of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>, Mercy de Guzman, a neighbor of accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz at <span class="SpellE">Purok</span> 5, West <span class="SpellE">Dirita</span>, San
Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, declared that between 10:00 and
11:00 o'clock in the evening on August 3, 1987, she was then at the balcony of
her house having some fresh air when accused <span class="SpellE">Januario</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz alighted from a tricycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After alighting <span class="SpellE">thereÂ­from</span>,
she saw him go inside his house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In returning its verdict, the lower court relied on the testimony
of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>, who drove the tricycle in which
the stabbing occurred, who narrated in detail the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">tragic trip from East <span class="SpellE">Dirita</span>, San Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> to San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, and who implicated <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz as one of the men who went </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that
journey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Cruz assigns a lone error
committed supposedly by the trial court, that is, that it was mistaken in
holding him liable as a co-conspira<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">t</span>or
in the killing of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the trial court noted, there is no dispute as to the <b>corpus
<span class="SpellE">delicti</span></b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is it questioned that <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">did not </span>personally inflict any injury on the
deceased, other than the fact that at the time the latter died, he was in the
scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is apparent is
that it was either Doming <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
(who has since<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> remained at large and
hence, beyond judicial jurisdiction), or the "Doe" accused, who
actually knifed the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue
then is whether or not <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz may be held
responsible on the theory of conspiracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue hangs on credibility of witnesses, and in this
connection, this Court has time and time again held that
"credibility" is the sole province of the trial court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from that, the records themselves amply show that <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz was indeed, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>co-conspirator in the murder of
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamolares</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio's</span> testimony was
candid and straightforward, and more importantly, <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz has shown no improper motive on <span class="SpellE">Pascasio's</span> part
that may have led him (<span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>) to lie on the stand.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Cruz's version that he had all
along been but a chance passenger in <span class="SpellE">Pascasio's</span>
tricycle and that he had merely accompanied <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span>,
et al., and that on their way, a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">free</span>-for-all had broken out leading to the
fatal stabbing, is hardly believable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>First, according to him, <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> was a total
stranger who had merely asked him a favor (to look for a ride to San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If this
were so, there was no need to go with him on that ride.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As common experience suggests, one does not
simply hang around with perfect strangers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Second, he did nothing after <span class="SpellE">Lachingco</span> had
disposed of the victim's remains (laid by the roadside), and subsequently,
after they had all gone home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His own
evidence does not indicate that he had indeed, thereafter sought to alert the
authorities about the murder he had witnessed, or at the very least, have <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span> come forward to acquit him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His behavior certainly does not speak his
innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the testimony alone of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>,
this Court is convinced that <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz was a co-conspirator in the murder of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamoleras</span>, Jr., and must be held as a co-principal along
with the actual killers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A conspiracy
exists when two or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission
of a felony and decide to commit it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
While proof of the agreement need not rest on direct evidence, the agreement
itself may be inferred from the conduct of the parties, disclosing a common
understanding among them with respect to the commission of the offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Pascasio's</span> recital that <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz was one of <span class="SpellE">Lachingco's</span> gang, one of whom thrust
a fatal stab wound on the deceased and threw his cadaver by the roadside, after
which <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz instructed him, <span class="SpellE">Pascasio</span>,
to take another route, and that he, <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, later
washed the <span class="SpellE">deadâ€™s</span> blood off the vehicle, are an
eloquent testimony of a conspiracy in the murder of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Pamolares</span>,
Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">proof </span>of treachery, in which the malefactors, without warning
and with no risk to themselves, did away with <span class="SpellE">Pamolares</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this score, however, this Court can not
appreciate evident premeditation as a qualifying circumstance, because in
evident premeditation, the time intervening between the plan to slay the victim
and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">actual slaying must be shown.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
