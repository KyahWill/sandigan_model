				G.R. No. 90369, October 31, 1990</h4>
				<H3>FLORENTINO CRUZ AND LINA CRUZ, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GANCAYCO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The enforceability of a deed of sale with assumption of mortgage
of property encumbered to the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS),
entered into without the previous consent of the latter, is the center of
controversy in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 22, 1970, petitioners bought a parcel of land with an area
of approximately 250 square meters from the spouses Oscar and Eva De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, registered owners thereof, under Transfer
Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 135319 issued by the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
time of the sale of the property, it was mortgaged to the GSIS for P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which obligation petitioners assumed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mortgage contract of the De <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes spouses with the GSIS stipulates that "the mortgagor shall not sell,
dispose of, mortgage nor in any manner encumber the mortgaged property without
the prior consent of the mortgagee."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Cruz went to the
Real Estate Department of the GSIS to secure its approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was interviewed by one Mr. Tobias <span class="SpellE">Jaylo</span> to whom he left a copy of the deed of sale with
assumption of mortgage,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span style="">his </span>letter
request that he be allowed to assume the mortgage obligation of the De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes spouses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After two weeks he returned to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Jaylo</span> only
to be informed that the records of the transaction with the De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes spouses could not be found, hence, his request
could not be acted upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">his </span>follow-up proved fruitless, he
left the matter to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Jaylo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1974</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Cruz wrote to the GSIS wherein
petitioner asked for the status of the loan and for a notification as to
arrearages, if any, for liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
GSIS denied having received this letter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, the amortization of the De <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes spouses fell due and the GSIS demanded payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the arrearages remained unpaid, the GSIS
applied for extrajudicial foreclosure of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foreclosure proceeding was actually held
on <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span style="">the
one-year period of redemption expired, the GSIS consolidated its ownership and
TCT No. 281934 was issued in</span> its favor on <st1:date year="1981" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1982</st1:date>,
the GSIS wrote a letter to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Cruz
and informed him that he was given the opportunity to repurchase the property
for P70<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay the monthly rental of
P600.00 beginning September 1978 until the corresponding contract of sale shall
have been made in favor of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner rejected the offer and insisted that he be <span style="">allowed </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">liquidate the mortgage
indebtedness on the property as of </span><st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="5"><span style="">May </span><span style="">20, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the Cruz spouses filed <span style="">a </span>complaint for annulment of foreclosure, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
and damages in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1984</st1:date>,
the Regional Trial Court rendered its decision dismissing the complaint with
costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals wherein in due
course a decision <span style="">was </span>rendered on <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="9">September
 25, 1989</st1:date> <span style="">affirming the
appealed decision with costs against petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Now come the petitioners with the herein petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
raising the sole issue of whether or not the respondent Court of Appeals
committed errors of law in affirming the order of dismissal issued by the lower
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, there can be no question that petitioners purchased
the property in question from the De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes
spouses by virtue of a deed of sale with assumption of mortgage of the property
without the previous consent of the respondent GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners thereby took a calculated risk
knowing as they did that under the mortgage contract of the De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes spouses with the <span style="">GSIS, its </span>previous consent must be secured in transactions of this
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When petitioners brought this
action to question the validity of the extrajudicial foreclosure sale of the
property, the burden was on them to prove their allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, petitioners failed to
discharge their burden.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, the contention of petitioners, to the effect
that the said foreclosure proceeded without their knowledge or prior notice to
them and that this invalidated the foreclosure proceeding, is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of contract between the petitioners <span style="">and
</span>the GSIS, the latter had no legal duty to notify the petitioners of the
said foreclosure proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the prior publication of the subject extrajudicial foreclosure sale in a
newspaper of general circulation operates as a constructive notice to the whole
world, including petitioners, of the said sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third place, there is no provision of law which requires
that when said extrajudicial sale is conducted special notice to petitioners as
alleged successors-in-interest of the mortgagors should be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Section
3 </span>of Act <span style="">No. 3135 </span>governing
extrajudicial foreclosure sales provides as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"Sec. 3.</span> <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Notice shall be given by posting notices of
the sale for not less than twenty days in at least three public places of the
municipality or city where the property is situated, and if such property is
worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall also be published once a
week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation
in the municipality or city."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing provision of law does not require any particular
notice to the mortgagors much less to their alleged successors-in-interest like
the petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the fourth place, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> </span>correctly observed that petitioners
have not established a cause of action against the respondent GSIS as its
previous written approval of the deed of sale with assumption of mortgage had
not been secured by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that the <span style="">petitioners
attempted to secure such approval subsequently by submitting a copy of the deed
to the GSIS through one Mr. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Jaylo</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">the fact remains that the ultimate approval
sought had not been granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the fifth place, the Court takes note of the fact that while
petitioners appear to have purchased the subject property in 1970, they took no<span style=""> </span>positive steps to pay the <span style="">mortgage obligation in the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to the respondent GSIS except through its letter
dated </span><st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="3"><span style="">March 12, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">
receipt of which is even denied by the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They knew that the mortgage obligation they assumed is to be paid in
monthly amortizations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should have
paid the same as stipulated but they failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they have only themselves to blame.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, even after the property was foreclosed and its
ownership was consolidated in the name of the respondent GSIS, in a letter to
petitioners dated September 7, 1982, the GSIS nevertheless gave them the
opportunity to redeem the property for P70,000.00 plus an amount corresponding
to reasonable rentals <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, petitioners rejected this
opportunity and instead insisted that they be allowed to liquidate the mortgage
indebtedness of the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the petitioners appeal that on the basis of equity they
should be allowed to redeem the property by liquidating the mortgage
indebtedness thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds no
cogent basis to grant this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As earlier stated petitioners took the risk of entering into a deed
of sale with assumption of mortgage to the property without securing the prior
consent of the respondent GSIS.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, petitioners did <span style="">not </span>pay
the amortization due to stave off a foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recourse of the petitioners, if at all,
should be against the De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes spouses and not
against the GSIS.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is DISMISSED without pronounce<span style="">ment as to costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
