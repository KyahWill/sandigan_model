				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On December 9, 1969, respondent Maria Loreto Diaz, as the
surviving legitimate child of the late <span class="SpellE">Chaoli</span>, filed
with respondent court a petition for the insertion in the Original Certificate
of Title No. 1324, after the registered owner's name "CHAOLI"; the
following phrase and words "Filipino citizen, of legal age, widow and a
resident of <span class="SpellE">Gumatdang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Itogon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Province," which phrase and words do not
appear and/or are not contained in the aforementioned Original Certificate of
Title No. 1324.</p>

hearing on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">March 2, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, respondent court issued an order, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Register of Deeds of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> is hereby ordered to amend the Original Certificate
of Title No. 1324, in such a manner that after the word and name 'CHAOLI' the
following phrase 'Filipino Citizen, of legal age, widow and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Gumatdang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Itogon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Province,' be inserted in the said certificate of
title upon payment by the Petitioner (herein private respondent) of the
necessary fees in accordance with law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court, before the finalization of this Order, welcomes as stated
previously any authorities which the Fiscal may submit and which may aid this
Court to reverse this Order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let the
Original Certificate of Title be returned to the Petitioner and/or her counsel
for the above-stated purpose."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Republic filed with respondent court a motion for
reconsideration of the latter's order, dated March 2, 1970, on the ground that
"there is no action or proceeding provided for by law for the judicial
declaration of the citizenship or status of a person, and that the petition
states no cause of action."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Respondent court, for
lack of merit, denied the motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
with prayer that the orders, dated March 2, 1970 and March 24, 1970, in Administrative
Case No. 1426, B. L. No. F-49844, Patent No. 16499, of </span>respondent Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio-Benguet</span>, be set aside and
that the petition of respondent Maria Loreto Diaz in said case, be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Petitioner claims that
the lower court erred </span>(1) in exercising jurisdiction over the petition
filed before it and in finding that petitioner herein had a cause of action;
and, (2) in ordering the amendment of Original Certificate of Title No. 1324
which, in effect declared private respondent's mother a Filipino, when there is
no proceeding available for the purpose of obtaining such a declaration of
citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">It is the position of the
petitioner Republic that the petition in the lower court partakes of the nature
of a summary proceeding where the parties affected were </span>not notified and
afforded protection on whatever interest they have; and that the insertions
sought in the Certificate of Title are controversial, and such being the case,
respondent court did not acquire jurisdiction over the petition in said summary
proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On the other hand, the
respondents contend that pursuant to Section 112 of Act No. 496, otherwise
known as the Land Registration Act, respondent court is legally vested with
power to act as a land registration court; that pursuant also to said Section
112 of the Land Registration Act, private respondent Maria Loreto Diaz, as the
only surviving legitimate child of <span class="SpellE">Chaoli</span>, filed with
respondent court a petition to insert the civil </span>status and other
personal circumstances of <span class="SpellE">Chaoli</span> in OCT No. 1324
(Free Patent); and that the citizenship, civil status and other personal
circumstances of the late <span class="SpellE">Chaoli</span> are not in issue in
the case, inasmuch as the same had already been considered in the administrative
proceedings which resulted in the issuance of said certificate of title in the
name of the late <span class="SpellE">Chaoli</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Caingat</span>, 25 SCRA 180, this Court, speak­ing through then
Chief Justice Roberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, held that "the
proceedings under Section 112 of Act No. 496 are summary in nature and are
allowed only when a scrutiny of the allegations discloses that the issues
presented by the pleadings need not be tried because they are so patently
insubstantial as not to be genuine issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The relief provided in said section can only be granted if there is
unanimity among the parties or there is no adverse claim or serious objection
on the part of any party in interest, for otherwise the case becomes
controversial and should be threshed out in an ordinary case or in the case
where the incident properly belongs and because controversies arising after the
entry of the original decree of registration are beyond the limited authority
of a land registration court to pass upon."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is no question about the controversial
nature of the petition before the respondent court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The civil status and more importantly, the
citi­zenship of <span class="SpellE">Chaoli</span> should be threshed out in a
proper proceeding where all the persons who may be affected therein are
notified and represented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 112 of
Act No. 496 is similar to the proceeding under Article 412 of the New Civil
Code in relation to Rule 108 of the Revised Rules of Court which calls for
correction of mere clerical, innocuous or harmless error in a person's
certificate of birth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings
therein are summary in nature and contemplate corrections or insertions of
mistakes which are only clerical in nature, but certainly not controversial
issues, such as citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Corrections
of substantial errors such as those that affect civil status or citizenship
cannot be granted except only in an adversary suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Administrative Case No. 1426, re-petition to insert civil status
and other personal circumstances in the Original Certificate of Title No. 1324
of the <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Registry of Deeds is not an adversary
suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not a proper action in which
an alleged omission regarding civil status and citizenship may be
inserted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no issue, dispute or
controversy between contending parties which the lower court was called upon to
decide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere naming of the <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Registry of Deeds and the Solicitor General, as
respondents, did not <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u> convert the same into an
adversary suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Orders, dated March 2, 1970 and March 24,
1970, in Administrative Case No. 1426 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> are SET ASIDE
