Eleventh Judicial District at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> with the crime of Murder

<blockquote>"That on or about the 25th day of November, 1968, in the City of
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with knives and a pestle,
conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping one another, without
any just motive and with intent to kill one <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, and by taking advantage of the darkness of the
night and of superior strength, with treachery and evident premeditation, did
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, suddenly and without any
warning, and from behind, attack, assault, strike, stab and wound with such
weapons on various parts of his body said <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, thus inflicting on him the following wounds:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) contusion and depressed <span class="SpellE">comminutive</span> fracture of the skull measuring about 3 inches
by 3/4 inches; (2) <span class="SpellE">mascesated</span> wound at the vertex
measuring about 2 inches in length, 3/4 in width, fracturing the skull and
injuring the brain tissues; (3) <span class="SpellE">ecchymosis</span> of the

<p class="BODY">After hearing the evidence adduced during the trial of the case,
Judge Leon <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, Jr., found the accused Fe­liciano
Alfaro and Isidro Alfaro guilty of the crime as charged and sentenced
"each of them to <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>, to
jointly and severally indemnify the heirs of the deceased MABINI AMORES in the
sum of TWELVE THOUSAND PESOS (P12,000.00) and to pay proportionate costs."
The other accused Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> was found guilty of
Homicide and sen­tenced to "undergo an imprisonment of SIX (6) YEARS and
ONE (1) DAY, <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> mayor</i>, minimum, to
FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY, <i>reclusion temporal</i>,
maximum; to pay the proportional costs of the proceedings, to indemnify jointly
and severally the heirs of the deceased in the sum of TWELVE THOUSAND PESOS
(12,000.00).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is entitled to one-half
(1/2) of the preventive imprisonment he may have undergone in connection with
this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall not suffer any
subsidiary personal liability by reason of the nature of the penalty imposed.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
From that sentence, all the three accused appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the early evening of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1968</st1:date>, in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mongpong</span>, a fishing village in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the accused Feliciano Alfaro called their neighbor <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amores</span> to come down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
answered the call and went down his house asking Feliciano Alfaro:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>"<span class="SpellE">Nano</span> <span class="SpellE">ato</span> <span class="SpellE">Marto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lesing</span>?"</i>

The accused Feliciano Alfaro exclaimed:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>"<span class="SpellE">Jugada</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">naton</span>
<span class="SpellE">ini</span></i>.<i>"</i> (This is our time.) At that
instant, the other accused Isidro Alfaro, younger brother of Feliciano, coming
from under the house of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>,
struck <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> on the
head, from behind, with a pestle which broke in two upon impact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> fell down on his face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused Feliciano Alfaro turned him over
and then stabbed him with a knife three (3) times in the abdomen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, the other accused Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>, brother-in-law of Feli­ciano and Isidro Alfaro
arrived and also stabbed <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
on the left side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing her
husband being attacked, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
put down the baby she was nursing, jumped down and covered her husband's body

Nevertheless, Isidro Alfaro again struck <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> with the pestle, hitting <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
on the forehead and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>

<p class="BODY">The accused Feliciano Alfaro and Isidro Alfaro ad­mitted killing <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, but claimed
self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their version of the
incident is that in the morning of <st1:date year="1968" day="24" month="11">November
 24, 1968</st1:date>, Feliciano Alfaro, who was then stay­ing in the house of
his father (<span class="SpellE">Egino</span> Alfaro) in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Mongpong</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, came home with a catch of
shrimps.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After eating, he went back to
his fish trap in the river.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, before
he left, he instructed his younger brother, Isidro Alfaro, not to sell all of
his catch and to save some for his (Feliciano's) wife <span class="SpellE">Tacing</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span>), who was
then harvesting rice in <span class="SpellE">Jamindan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>,
and was expected to return home at any time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On his return at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon, Feliciano Alfaro heard <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> griping (<i>"<span class="SpellE">binuroka</span>"</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Feliciano asked Isidro what <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> was grumbling about and Isidro answered:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"He is mad at you and myself because he
wanted to buy shrimps but I did not sell shrimps to him because you told me not
to sell them." Feliciano reproached his brother for not giving some
shrimps to <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>, but Isidro insisted that he was
afraid Feliciano might scold him if there were no more shrimps left.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 6:30 o'clock in the evening of the following day,
November 25, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
was seen standing in the yard, with arms folded, resting on his stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Feliciano Alfaro came near him, <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> swung a concealed
bolo at him, from left to right, hitting Feliciano on the right arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> again swung at Feliciano but the latter was able to
catch the hand holding the bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
wrestled for the bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the scuffle,
Feliciano was wounded on the outer arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Feliciano shouted at <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Benny you <span class="SpellE">boloed</span>
me," and the latter answered:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I had been waiting for you since yesterday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You call your brothers, I wanted to kill all
of you." <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
then kicked Feliciano on the stomach and the latter fell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As Feliciano was lying down, Isidro Alfaro
came with a pestle in hand, to pacify the protagonists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> swung at Isidro, but the latter parried the blow
with the pestle which was cut in two.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then, Isidro struck <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
on the head with the pestle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> "turned around
and (when) he was about to fall on me (Feliciano) with the intention of <span class="SpellE">boloing</span> me once more," Feliciano drew his knife and
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amores</span> fell, they left.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Feliciano Alfaro ran towards the city where
he later surrendered to police authorities,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
while Isidro Alfaro "went up to our house and got my child and wife"
and then fled to the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> swamps.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other accused, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>, upon
the other hand, denied participation in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amores</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
claimed that about 6:00 o'clock in the evening of November 25, 1968, he was in
their house, about 400 meters away from the house of his father-in-law (<span class="SpellE">Egino</span> Alfaro) where the incident took place, together with
his daughter, Clara, and two grandchildren.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was sick and was lying down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had chills and was spitting blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because of this, he sent his daughter Clara to buy
"Vicks".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thirty minutes later,
Clara returned and was still panting when she informed him that "<span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> Toto <span class="SpellE">Felesing</span>." Fearful "that Feliciano might come up
the house being chased by <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>," he told his
daughter to close the doors.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Having admitted that they inflicted the injuries which caused the
death of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, it
was incumbent upon the accused Feliciano Alfaro and Isidro Alfaro, in order to
avoid criminal liability, to prove the justifying circumstance of self-defense
to the satisfaction of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To do
so, they must rely on the strength of their own evidence and not on the
weakness of the prosecution, for even if that were weak, it could not be
disbelieved after the accused himself had admitted the killing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This is so because the claim of self-defense is an affirmative allegation which
must be established by convincing evidence and not of doubtful veracity,
otherwise, the conviction of the accused is imperative.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the trial court correctly rejected the
appellants' claim of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
begin with, the appellants failed to present the bolo purportedly used by the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the appellants'
production of the bolo upon the surrender of Feliciano Alfaro was one way of
bolstering their story, but they failed to produce the bolo nor account for
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The non-presentation and failure to
account for the non-presentation of the weapon allegedly wielded by the victim
is fatal to the plea of self-defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants also failed to narrate the alleged armed
aggression by the victim when Feliciano Alfaro surrendered to the police or at
any time during his detention prior to the trial of the case and there is
nothing in the record to explain the appellant's omission in voicing out his
version of self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the presence of several fatal wounds on the deceased and
the fact that the appellants suffered no serious wounds, as per the medical
certificate wherein it is stated that the accused Feliciano Alfaro merely
suffered sub-<span class="SpellE">cutaneous</span> wounds,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
although the victim had allegedly struck him by surprise with a bolo which
could cut a pestle in two, belie unlawful aggression.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had the victim been the aggressor, it would
seem incredible for him to have sustained so many serious and fatal wounds
without being able to inflict any considerable injury on the alleged object of
his aggression.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, if it were true
that the accused were merely acting in self-defense, why did they have to
inflict so many serious wounds on the deceased when the two initial blows dealt
by the accused Isidro Alfaro on the head of the deceased with a pestle was
sufficient to repel the attack?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
follow­ing observation of the trial court is well taken:</p>

<blockquote>"Another part of the defense' account that suggests
self-defense but which is difficult to believe are the wounds on the right arm
and outer portion of the elbow of Feliciano Alfaro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the bolo used by <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amores</span> was sharp-edged as to be able to cut a pestle
into two parts, as demonstrated by the defense, then it is surprising that
Feliciano Alfaro only sustained superficial or skin-deep wounds when hit by the
same bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If, indeed, <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> used a razor-sharp
bolo in attacking Feliciano Alfaro, it is logical to expect more serious
wounds, even assuming that the bolo blows were not strong or that they were
parried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And if <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amores</span> was truly armed, then when Feliciano Alfaro
fell down, the former could have slashed the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circum­stances it is difficult to
believe that <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
was armed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it appears that Feliciano Alfaro is bigger and taller
than <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
so that it is highly improbable for <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> to have dared initiate the fight against Feliciano
Alfaro.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the witnesses for the prosecution proved
conclusively to the satisfaction of the court that the version of the
prosecution is the true one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court said:</p>

<blockquote>"To the mind of the Court the account of the prosecution
evidence deserves full faith and credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacundo</span>, a
fourteen (14) year old, rural boy withstood a relentless and withering
cross-examination by distinguished counsel of the accused stuck firmly to what
he witnessed on the tragic evening of <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November
 25, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could not be
drawn off-tangent of his principal version that <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amores</span> was struck on the head from be­hind by Isidro
Alfaro, then stabbed by Feliciano Alfaro, three (3) times and then by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> on the left side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that Isidro Alfaro struck on the head covered or protected by
the body of <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>,
is confirmed by Exhibit 'E' of the prosecution which show the injury on the
shoulder of <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>
who was then on top of her fallen husband.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The recital of the events leading to the death of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> ventilated by the
prosecu­tion could not be discredited on cross-examination; nor did the defense
evidence overthrow its validity and weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There were, it is true, some discrepancies and contradictions in the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacundo</span>
and the wife of the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, but instead of discrediting them only strengthened
their candor and sincerity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If they had
lapses, that only proved that they were not coached, but declared only on what
they know, subject always to disadvantages like their lowly education and the
strange atmosphere of a courtroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the main, though, the prosecution witnesses remained steadfast to their
narrations regarding the manner the accused killed their unfortunate victim, <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly stated in <i>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Vinas</span></i>, 'Contradictions indicate veracity rather than
prevarication.' (25 SCRA 683)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the alibi of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
that he was sick and was lying down in his house, about 400 meters away from
the scene of the crime, suffice it to state that he was positively identified
as one of the perpetrators of the crime and there is no convincing proof that
it was impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime when it was
committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following findings of the
trial court is noteworthy:</p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the <u>alibi</u> of the third accused,
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>, that he was chilling and spat blood
that evening, and did not go out of his house for two days, can hardly be
considered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is a brother-in-law of
the <span class="SpellE">Alfaros</span>, his co-accused and his house is only
about four (4) hundred meters from the scene of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>,
from his house to the scene of the crime at bar is a good trail and the
distance can be negotiated in a five minute leisurely walk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not therefore impossible for him to be
a participant in the commission of the offense charged because of the nearness
of his house to the house of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u>alibi</u>
is, therefore, rejected, being weak.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In connection with the allegation of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> that on <st1:date year="1968" day="25" month="11">November
 25, 1968</st1:date>, he spat blood and was chilling, the Court, in an order, had
subject person examined by government doctors to determine if he was suffering
from tuberculosis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The report of the
Anti-TB pavilion of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, indicates that the lungs of
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> is suggestive of TB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If, as averred, that he spat blood on November
25, 1968, and taking into consideration that he had been detained for almost a
year by his own statement given in open court, then his lungs would not only
suggest TB but his lungs would show deterioration, especially that food in
prison is commonly regarded as not nutritious."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the end, We are satisfied that no overriding consideration
exists to justify the reversal of the judgment appealed from.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the conviction of the appellants
are affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly found that the killing of <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span> was characterized
by <span class="SpellE"><i>alevosia</i></span> because the attack was sudden and
unexpected and the deceased had his back turned to Isidro Alfaro who struck him
on the <span class="SpellE">heaed</span> with a pestle, catching him totally
unprepared to make a defense on his person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, the accused employed means, methods or forms in
the execu­tion of the crime which tended directly and specially to insure its
execution without risk to themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the penalty of <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>
imposed upon the accused Feliciano Alfaro is incorrect as the trial court
appreciated the generic aggravating circum­stance of abuse of superiority to
off-set the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Abuse of superiority, like <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>, is absorbed in treachery and cannot be
estimated as an independent aggravating circumstance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

There being a mitigating circumstance, without any aggra­vating circumstance to
off-set it, the imposable penalty was <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty imposed upon Isidro Alfaro, who did not surrender but
fled to the nearby <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> swamps with his wife and
child after killing <span class="SpellE">Mabini</span> <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>,
is correct and should be, as it is hereby, affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty imposed upon the other appellant Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> is also correct and should be, as it is hereby,
affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, Feliciano Alfaro is hereby sentenced to suffer
a penalty of SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY to TWENTY
(20) YEARS of <i>reclusion</i> <i>temporal</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED in all other
respects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With costs against the
accused-appellants.</p>
