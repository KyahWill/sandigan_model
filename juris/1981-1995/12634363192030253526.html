				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">What item or items of employee remuneration should go into the
computation of thirteenth month pay is the basic issue presented in these
consolidated petitions.  Otherwise
stated, the question is whether or not the respondent labor officials in
computing said benefit, committed “grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
of jurisdiction,” by giving effect to Section 5 of the Revised Guidelines on
the Implementation of the Thirteenth Month Pay (Presidential Decree No. 851)
promulgated by then Secretary of Labor and Employment, Hon. Franklin Drilon,
and overruling petitioners' contention that said provision constituted a
usurpation of legislative power because not justified by or within the
authority of the law sought to be implemented besides being violative of the
equal protection of the law clause of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolution of the issue entails, first, a review of the pertinent
provisions of the laws and implementing regulations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sections 1 and 2 of Presidential Decree No. 851, the Thirteenth
Month Pay Law, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 1. All employers are hereby required to pay all their
employees receiving basic salary of not more than P1,000.00 a month, regardless
of the nature of the employment, a 13th month pay not later than December 24 of
every year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SEC. 2. Employers already paying their employees a 13th month pay
or its equivalent are not covered by this Decree.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Rules and Regulations Implementing P.D. 851 promulgated by
then Labor Minister Blas Ople on December 22, 1975 contained the following
relevant provisions relative to the concept of "thirteenth month pay"
and the employers exempted from giving it, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 2.  Definition of
certain terms. -- - **</blockquote>

<blockquote>a)  “Thirteenth month pay”
shall mean one twelfth (1/12) of the basic salary of an employee within a
calendar year;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)  "Basic Salary"
shall include all remunerations or earnings paid by an employer to an employee
for services rendered but may not include cost-of-living allowances granted
pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 525 or Letter of Instructions No. 174,
profit-sharing payments, and all allowances and monetary benefits which are not
considered or integrated as part of the regular or basic salary of the employee
at the time of the promulgation of the Decree on December 16, 1975.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SEC. 3. Employers covered.- ** (The law applies) to all employers
except to:</blockquote>

<p class="3Q">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<blockquote>c)  Employers already
paying their employees a 13-month pay or more in a calendar year or its
equivalent at the time of this issuance;</blockquote>

<p class="3Q">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<blockquote>e)  Employers of those who
are paid on purely commission, boundary, or task basis, and those who are paid
a fixed amount for performing a specific work, irrespective of the time
consumed in the performance thereof, except where the workers are paid on piece
rate basis in which case the employer shall be covered by this issuance insofar
as such workers are concerned.</blockquote>

<p class="3Q">* * *<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>* * * * * *</p>

<blockquote>The term "its equivalent" as used in paragraph (c) shall
include Christmas bonus, mid-year bonus, profit-sharing payments and other cash
bonuses amounting to not less than 1/12th of the basic salary but shall not
include cash and stock dividends, cost of living allowances and all other
allowances regularly enjoyed by the employee, as well as non-monetary
benefits.  Where an employer pays less than
1/12th of the employee's basic salary, the employer shall pay the difference.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Supplementary Rules and Regulations Implementing P.D. 851 were
subsequently issued by Minister Ople which <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">inter </span>alia</i> set out items of compensation not included in the
computation of the 13th month pay, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">viz</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>SEC. 4. Overtime pay, earnings and other remunerations which are
not part of the basic salary shall not be included in the computation of the
13th month pay.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On August 13, 1986, President Corazon C. Aquino promulgated
Memorandum Order No. 28, which contained a single provision modifying
Presidential Decree No. 851 by removing the salary ceiling of P1,000.00 a month
set by the latter, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 851 is hereby modified to the
extent that all employers are hereby required to pay all their rank-and­-file
employees a 13th month pay not later than December 24, of every year.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Slightly more than a year later, on November 16, 1987, Revised
Guidelines on the Implementation of the 13th Month Pay Law were promulgated by
then Labor Secretary Franklin Drilon which, among other things, defined with
particularity what remunerative items were and were not embraced in the concept
of 13th month pay, and specifically dealt with employees who are paid a fixed
or guaranteed wage plus commission.  The
relevant provisions read:</p>

<blockquote>4.  Amount and payment of
13th Month Pay.</blockquote>

<p class="3Q">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<blockquote>The basic salary of an employee for the purpose of computing the
13th month pay shall include all remunerations or earnings paid by his employer
for services rendered but does not include allowances and monetary benefits
which are not considered or integrated as part of the regular or basic salary,
such as the cash equivalent of unused vacation and sick leave credits,
overtime, premium, night differential and holiday pay, and cost-of-living
allowances.  However, these
salary-related benefits should be included as part of the basic salary in the
computation of the 13th month pay if by individual or collective agreement,
company practice or policy, the same are treated as part of the basic salary of
the employees.</blockquote>

<p class="3Q">* * * * * * * * *</p>

<blockquote>5. 13th Month Pay for Certain Types of Employees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)  Employees Paid by
Results.- Employees who are paid on piece work basis are by law entitled to the
13th month pay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Employees who are paid a fixed or guaranteed wage plus commission
are also entitled to the mandated 13th month pay based on their total earnings
during the calendar year, i.e., on both their fixed or guaranteed wage and commission.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This was the state of the law when the controversies at bar arose
out of the following antecedents:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(<u>RE G.R. No. 92174</u>)
</span>A routine inspection was conducted on May 2, 1989 in the premises of
petitioner Boie-Takeda Chemicals, Inc. by Labor and Development Officer
Reynaldo B. Ramos under Inspection Authority No. 4-209-89.  Finding that Boie-Takeda had not been
including the commissions earned by its medical representatives in the
computation of their 13th month pay, Ramos served a Notice of Inspection
Results<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

on Boie-Takeda through its president, Mr. Benito Araneta, requiring Boie-Takeda
within ten (10) calendar days from notice to effect restitution or correction
of "the underpayment of 13th month pay for the year(s) 1986, 1987 and 1988
of Med Rep (Revised Guidelines on the Implementation of 13th month pay # 5) in
the total amount of P558,810.89."</p>

<p class="BODY">Boie-Takeda wrote the Labor Department contesting the Notice of
Inspection Results, and expressing the view "that the commission paid to
our medical representatives are not to be included in the computation of the
13th month pay * * (since the) law and its implementing rules speak of REGULAR
or BASIC salary and therefore exclude all other remunerations which are not
part of the REGULAR salary." It pointed out that, "If no sales is
(sic) made under the effort of a particular representative, there is no
commission during the period when no sale was transacted, so that commissions
are not and cannot be legally defined as regular in nature."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

before his Office on June 9 and 16, 1989.  On the appointed dates, however, and despite due notice, no one appeared
for Boie-Takeda, and the matter had perforce to be resolved on the basis of the
evidence at hand.  On July 24, 1989,
Director Piezas issued an Order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

seasonably filed by Boie-Takeda under date of August 3, 1989.  Treated as an appeal, it was resolved on
January 17, 1990 by then Acting Labor Secretary Dionisio de la Serna, who
affirmed the July 24, 1989 Order with modification that the sales commissions
earned by Boie-Takeda's medical representatives before August 13, 1989, the
effectivity date of Memorandum Order No. 28 and its Implementing Guidelines,

<p class="BODY">(<u>RE G.R. No. 102552</u>) A similar Routine Inspection was
conducted in the premises of Philippine Fuji Xerox Corp. on September 7, 1989

<blockquote>"Underpayment of 13th month pay of 62 employees, more or less
-- pursuant to Revised Guidelines on the Implementation of the 13th month pay
law for the period covering 1986, 1987 and 1988."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Philippine Fuji Xerox was requested to
effect rectification and/or restitution of the noted violation within five (5)
working days from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">No action having been taken thereon by Philippine Fuji Xerox, Mr.
Eduardo G. Gonzales, President of Philxerox Employees Union, wrote then Labor
Secretary Franklin Drilon requesting a follow-up of the inspection
findings.  Messrs. Nicolas and Gonzales
were summoned to appear before Labor Employment and Development Officer Mario
F. Santos, NCR Office, Department of Labor for a conciliation conference.  When no amicable settlement was reached, the
parties were required to file their position papers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Regional Director Luna C. Piezas issued an Order
dated August 23, 1990,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, Respondent PHILIPPINE FUJI
XEROX is hereby ordered to restitute to its salesmen the portion of the 13th
month pay which arose out of the non-implementation of the said revised
guidelines, ten (10) days from receipt hereof, otherwise, Mr. NICANOR TORRES,
the SR. LABOR EMPLOYMENT OFFICER is hereby Ordered to proceed to the premises
of the Respondent for the purpose of computing the said deficiency (sic) should
respondent fail to heed this Order."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Philippine Fuji Xerox appealed the aforequoted Order to the
Office of the Secretary of Labor.  In an
Order dated October 10, 1991, Undersecretary Cresenciano B. Trajano denied the
appeal for lack of merit.  Hence, the
petition in G.R. No. 102552, which was ordered consolidated with G.R. No. 92174
as involving the same issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their almost identically-worded petitions, petitioners,
through common counsel, attribute grave abuse of discretion to respondent labor
officials Hon. Dionisio dela Serna and Undersecretary Cresenciano B. Trajano in
issuing the questioned Orders of January 17, 1990 and October 10, 1991,
respectively.  They maintain that under
P. D. 851, the 13th month pay is based solely on basic salary.  As defined by the law itself and clarified
by the Implementing and Supplementary Rules as well as by the Supreme Court in
a long line of decisions, remunerations which do not form part of the basic or
regular salary of an employee, such as commissions, should not be considered in
the computation of the 13th month pay.  This being the case, the Revised Guidelines on the Implementation of the
13th Month Pay Law issued by then Secretary Drilon providing for the inclusion
of commissions in the 13th month pay, were issued in excess of the statutory
authority conferred by P.D. 851.  According to petitioners, this conclusion becomes even more evident when
considered in light of the opinion rendered by Labor Secretary Drilon himself
in "In Re:  Labor Dispute at the
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company" which affirmed the
contemporaneous interpretation by then Secretary Ople that commissions are
excluded from basic salary.  Petitioners
further contend that assuming that Secretary Drilon did not exceed the
statutory authority conferred by P.D. 851, still the Revised Guidelines are
null and void as they violate the equal protection of the law clause.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents through the Office of the Solicitor General question
the propriety of petitioners' attack on the constitutionality of the Revised
Guidelines in a petition for <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span>which, they contend, should be
confined purely to the correction of errors and/or defects of jurisdiction,
including matters of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction and not extend to a collateral attack on the validity and/or
constitutionality of a law or statute.  They aver that the petitions do not advance any cogent reason or state
any valid ground to sustain the allegation of grave abuse of discretion, and
that at any rate, P.D. No. 851, otherwise known as the 13th Month Pay Law has
already been amended by Memorandum Order No. 28 issued by President Corazon C.
Aquino on August 13, 1986 so that commissions are now imputed into the
computation of the 13th Month Pay.  They
add that the Revised Guidelines issued by then Labor Secretary Drilon merely
clarified a gray area occasioned by the silence of the law as to the nature of
commissions; and worked no violation of the equal protection clause of the
Constitution, said Guidelines being based on reasonable classification.  Respondents point to the case of <i>Songco
vs. National Labor Relations Commission</i>, 183 SCRA 610, wherein this Court
declared that Article 97(f) of the Labor Code is explicit that commission is
included in the definition of the term "wage".</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule for the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to respondents' contention, Memorandum Order No. 28 did
not repeal, supersede or abrogate P.D. 851.  As may be gleaned from the language of Memorandum Order No. 28, it
merely "modified" Section 1 of the decree by removing the P1,000.00
salary ceiling.  The concept of 13th
Month Pay as envisioned, defined and implemented under P.D. 851 remained
unaltered, and while entitlement to said benefit was no longer limited to
employees receiving a monthly basic salary of not more than P1,000.00, said
benefit was, and still is, to be computed on the basic salary of the
employee-recipient as provided under P.D. 851.  Thus, the interpretation given to the term "basic salary" as
defined in P.D. 851 applies equally to "basic salary" under
Memorandum Order No. 28.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <i>San Miguel Corp. vs. Inciong</i>, 103 SCRA 139,
this Court delineated the coverage of the term "basic salary" as used
in P.D. 851.  We said at some length:</p>

<blockquote>"Under Presidential Decree 851 and its implementing rules, the
basic salary of an employee is used as the basis in the determination of his
13th month pay.  Any compensations or
remunerations which are deemed not part of the basic pay is excluded as basis
in the computation of the mandatory bonus.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the Rules and Regulations Implementing Presidential
Decree 851, the following compensations are deemed not part of the basic
salary:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">a)  Cost-of-living
allowances granted pursuant to Presidential Decree 525 and Letter of Instructions
No. 174;</p>

<p class="2Q">b)  Profit-sharing payments;</p>

<p class="2Q">c) All allowances and monetary benefits which are not considered or
integrated as part of the regular basic salary of the employee at the time of
the promulgation of the Decree on December 16, 1975.</p>

<blockquote>"Under a later set of Supplementary Rules and Regulations
Implementing Presidential Decree 851 issued by then Labor Secretary Blas Ople,
overtime pay, earnings and other remunerations are excluded as part of the
basic salary and in the computation of the 13th month pay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The exclusion of cost-of-living allowances under Presidential
Decree 525 and Letter of Instructions No. 174, and profit-sharing payments
indicate the intention to strip basic salary of other payments which are
properly considered as 'fringe' benefits.  Likewise, the catch-all exclusionary phrase 'all allowances and monetary
benefits which are not considered or integrated as part of the basic salary'
shows also the intention to strip basic salary of any and all additions which
may be in the form of allowances or 'fringe' benefits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the Supplementary Rules and Regulations
Implementing Presidential Decree 851 is even more emphatic in declaring that
earnings and other remunerations which are not part of the basic salary shall
not be included in the computation of the 13th-month pay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While doubt may have been created by the prior Rules and
Regulations Implementing Presidential Decree 851 which defines basic salary to
include all remunerations or earnings paid by an employer to an employee, this
cloud is dissipated in the later and more controlling Supplementary Rules and
Regulations which categorically exclude from the definitions of basic salary
earnings and other remunerations paid by employer to an employee.  A cursory perusal of the two sets of Rules
indicates that what has hitherto been the subject of a broad inclusion is now a
subject of broad exclusion.  The
Supplementary Rules and Regulations cure the seeming tendency of the former
rules to include all remunerations and earnings within the definition of basic
salary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The all embracing phrase 'earnings and other remunerations' which
are deemed not part of the basic salary includes within its meaning payments
for sick, vacation, or maternity leaves, premium for works performed on rest
days and special holidays, pays for regular holidays and night
differentials.  As such they are deemed
not part of the basic salary and shall not be considered in the computation of
the 13th-month pay.  If they were not
excluded, it is hard to find any 'earnings and other remunerations' expressly
excluded in the computation of the 13th-month pay.  Then the exclusionary provision would prove to be idle and with
no purpose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This conclusion finds strong support under the Labor Code of
the Philippines.  To cite a few provisions:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Art. 87. Overtime work.  Work may be performed beyond eight (8) hours a day provided that the
employee is paid for the overtime work, additional compensation equivalent to
his regular wage plus at least twenty-five (25%) percent thereof.'</p>

<blockquote>It is clear that overtime pay is an
additional compensation other than and added to the regular wage or basic
salary, for reason of which such is categorically excluded from the definition
of basic salary under the Supplementary Rules and Regulations Implementing
Presidential Decree 851.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In Article 93 of the same Code, paragraph</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'c)  work performed on any
special holiday shall be paid an additional compensation of at least thirty
percent (30%) of the regular wage of the employee.'</p>

<blockquote>"It is likewise clear that premiums for special holiday which
is at least 30% of the regular wage is an <i>additional pay</i> other than and
added to the regular wage or basic salary.  For similar reason, it shall not be considered in the computation of the
13th-month pay.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Quite obvious from the foregoing is that the term "basic
salary" is to be understood in its common, generally-accepted meaning,
i.e., as a rate of pay for a standard work period exclusive of such additional
payments as bonuses and overtime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> This
is how the term was also understood in the case of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Pless </span>v. </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Franks</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>308 S.W. 2d. 402, 403, 202 Tenn.
630, which held that in statutes providing that pension should not be less than
50 percent of "basic salary" at the time of retirement, the quoted
words meant the salary that an employee (e.g., a policeman) was receiving at
the time he retired without taking into consideration any extra compensation to
which he might be entitled for extra work.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In remunerative schemes consisting of a fixed or guaranteed wage
plus commission, the fixed or guaranteed wage is patently the "basic
salary" for this is what the employee receives for a standard work
period.  Commissions are given for extra
efforts exerted in consummating sales or other related transactions.  They are, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">as </span>such, additional pay, which this Court has made clear do not
form part of the "basic salary."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents would do well to distinguish this case from <i>Songco
vs. National Labor Relations Commission, supra</i>, upon which they rely so
heavily.  What was involved therein was
the term "salary" without the restrictive adjective
"basic".  Thus, in said case,
we construed the term in its generic sense to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">refer </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">all types </span>of
"direct remunerations for services rendered," including
commissions.  In the same case, we also
took judicial notice of the fact "that some salesmen do not receive any
basic salary but depend on commissions and allowances or commissions alone,
although an employer-employee relationship exists," which statement is
quite significant in that it speaks of a "basic salary" apart and
distinct from "commissions" and "allowances".  Instead of supporting respondents' stand, it
would appear that <i>Songco</i> itself recognizes that commissions are not part
of "basic salary."</p>

<p class="BODY">In including commissions in the computation of the 13th month pay,
the second paragraph of Section 5 (a) of the Revised Guidelines on the
Implementation of the 13th Month Pay Law unduly expanded the concept of
"basic salary" as defined in P.D. 851.  It is a fundamental rule that implementing rules cannot add to or
detract from the provisions of the law it is designed to implement.  Administrative regulations adopted under
legislative authority by a particular department must be in harmony with the
provisions of the law they are intended to carry into effect.  They cannot widen its scope.  An administrative agency cannot amend an act
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Congress.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
