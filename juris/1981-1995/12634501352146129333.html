<p class="BODY">The only issue to be resolved is whether a criminal case charging
simple seduction which is penalized by law by not more than <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><u><span style=""> mayor</span></u><span style=""> </span>or not more than six months, comes under the exclusive
jurisdiction of a municipal or city court.</p>

<p class="BODY">If upon conviction, the court will have to impose only a term of
imprisonment as a penalty of not more than <span style="">six (6) </span>months, there would be no
doubt that only the inferior court, a <span style="">city
or </span>municipal court, to the exclusion of the Court of First Instance, has
jurisdiction to try and decide a case for simple seduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But together with the imprisonment, a judgment
of conviction would require the court to order the acknowledgement by the
accused of the offspring, if any, and to give <span style="">him support, aside from the indemnification of the offended woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this circumstance, the Supreme Court had
ruled as early as 1911</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that a justice of the peace court is
divested of jurisdiction over a case for simple seduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling, divided though it may be, was
later reiterated, this time by an undivided court, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Luansing</span> vs. People</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On the issue of jurisdiction, Section 44(f), Republic Act No.
296, as amended, provides that Courts of First Instance have original
jurisdiction of "all criminal cases in which the penalty provided by law
is imprisonment for more than <span style="">six </span>months,
or a fine of more than two hundred pesos," and section 87(b) of the same
Act provides that Justice of the Peace and Municipal Courts have original
jurisdiction over "all offenses in which<span style=""> the penalty provided by law is imprisonment for not more than two
hundred pesos, or both such fine and imprisonment." The penalty imposed by
Article 338 of simple seduction is <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor, the
duration of which is from one month or one day to six months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Apparently, the crime of simple seduction
falls under the original jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace or Municipal
Courts</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>However, it should not be
overlooked that persons guilty of seduction shall also be sentenced to indemnify
the offended woman, to acknowledge the offspring unless the law should prevent
him from so doing, and to give support to such offspring</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 345, Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are inherent accessory civil
liabilities when a child is born as a result of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The acknowledgment of and the giving of
support to, the offspring are matters beyond the jurisdiction of the Justice of
the Peace or Municipal Courts</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>They
pertain to the Courts of First Instance (Section 44(a) and (e), Republic Act
No. 296)</u>.</span><u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has been held that laws conferring jurisdiction on the
inferior courts over demands below certain amounts do not preclude a
determination of said demands in the superior court, where they are connected
with larger claims or with a type of demand solely within the jurisdiction of
the superior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus for instance
where an action is within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance <span style="">because it involves an issue of admiralty,
the said court must be held likewise to have jurisdiction over other causes of
action joined thereto even if the amount sought to be collected is less than
the jurisdictional limit (Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>.
General de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span> de Filipinas, G. R. No. L-22625, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="4"><span style="">April
 27, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In like manner, <u>since the crime of
seduction carries with it a liability, under Article 345 of the Revised Penal
Code, to acknowledge and give support to the offspring resulting from the crime
- matters beyond the jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace or Municipal Courts
- it follows that the instant case falls within the jurisdiction of the Court
of First Instance (U.S. vs. Bernardo, 19 Phil. 265)</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be absurd to have the principal case
of seduction tried and decided by the Municipal Court </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">the resulting acknowledgment and support of the offspring by the Court
of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duplication would
entail unnecessary waste of time and effort for the parties and for the courts,
to the detriment of an orderly administration of justice."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents have adduced no arguments except to quote the
dissenting opinion of Justice Moreland in the Bernardo case which was clearly
rejected in the case of <span class="SpellE">Luansing</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case, there is not the
slightest doubt as to the soundness of the ruling therein laid down,
reaffirming the Bernardo doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
perceive no reason to depart from a ruling so firmly established, directing its
application squarely on the given facts of the present case, in relation <span style="">to </span>the precise question of jurisdiction
as has been decisively presented herein for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling which We here merely reaffirm is obviously supported
by well-established principles relevant to the situation at hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unquestionable that the Court of First
Instance, taking cognizance of a criminal case coming under its jurisdiction
may, after trial, impose a penalty that is proper for a crime within the
exclusive competence of a municipal or city court as the evidence would
warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not be said, therefore,
that the Court of First Instance would be acting without jurisdiction if in a
simple seduction case, it would impose penalty of not more than six months of
imprisonment, if said case, for the reason already adverted to, be held to fall
under the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, not a city or municipal
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, an action for recognition is always taken
cognizance of by the Court of First Instance exercising original jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, if a simple seduction case is placed
under the jurisdiction of a city or a municipal court, judgment of conviction
proceeding <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, with an order of<span style=""> recognition and support of the offspring, if
appealed to the Court of First Instance, would call upon the latter court to
exercise appellate jurisdiction on a matter for which the law has vested on its
original jurisdiction - the recognition of a child by its putative parent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This unusual occurrence, which the </span><span style="">law </span><span style="">could not have had within its contemplation, would be avoided by the
ruling We are merely reiterating from previous cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The working of the law as manifestly
intended, and as had been already in long constant practice, will then be allowed
to remain undisturbed in a most desirable state of consistency and orderliness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This consideration of consistency and orderliness makes <span style="">irrelevant </span>the fact as alleged in
private respondent's Answer that complainant has given birth to a child some
eighteen <span style="">months after the alleged
commission of sexual intercourse for which respondent </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santiago</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> is accused for simple seduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a </span><span style="">fact </span><span style="">still to be proven
by competent evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As respondents
themselves admit, in criminal prosecutions, jurisdiction of the court is not
determined by what may be meted out to the offender after trial,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or even by the result of the evidence that
would be presented during the trial,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>but by the extent of the penalty
which the law imposes, together <span style="">with
other legal obligations, on the basis of the facts as recited in the complaint
or information</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> constitutive of the offense charged, for
once jurisdiction is acquired by the court in which the information is filed,
it is there retained regardless of whether the evidence proves a lesser offense
</span>than that charged in the information.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>
