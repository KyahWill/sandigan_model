				<H3>BENGUET CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. CENTRAL BOARD OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS, LOCAL BOARD OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS OF THE PROVINCE OF BENGUET, AND MUNICIPAL ASSESSOR OF ITOGON, BENGUET, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">BENGUET CORPORATION, in this original petition for certiorari,
seeks to annul and set aside the Decision of the Central Board of Assessment
Appeals of May 28, 1991, as well as the Resolution of July 1, 1991, denying its
motion for reconsideration, which affirmed the decision of respondent Local
Board of Assessment Appeals of the Province of Benguet declaring as valid the
tax assessments made by the Municipal Assessor of Itogon, Benguet, on the
bunkhouses of petitioner occupied as dwelling by its rank and file employees
based on Tax Declarations Nos. 8471 and 10454.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Provincial Assessor of Benguet, through the Municipal
Assessor of Itogon, assessed real property tax on the bunkhouses of petitioner
Benguet Corporation occupied for residential purposes by its rank and file
employees under Tax Declarations Nos. 8471 (effective 1985) and 10454
(effective 1986).  According to the
Provincial Assessor, the tax exemption of bunkhouses under Sec. 3 (a), P.D. 745
(Liberalizing the Financing and Credit Terms for Low Cost Housing Projects of
Domestic Corporations and Partnerships), was withdrawn by P.D.1955
(Withdrawing, Subject to Certain Conditions, the Duty and Tax Privileges
Granted to Private Business Enterprises and/or Persons Engaged in Any Economic
Activity, and Other Purposes).  Petitioner appealed the assessment on Tax Declarations Nos. 8471 and
10454 to the Local Board of Assessment Appeals (LBAA) of the Province of
Benguet, docketed as LBAA Cases Nos. 42 and 43, respectively.  Both were heard jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the parties agreed to suspend hearings in LBAA Cases
Nos. 42 and 43 to await the outcome of another case, LBAA Case No. 41, covering
Tax Declaration No. 9534 (effective 1984), which involved the same parties and
issue until the appeal was decided by the Central Board of Assessment Appeals
(CBAA).  On July 15, 1986, CBAA handed
down its decision in LBAA Case No. 41 holding that the buildings of petitioner
used as dwellings by its rank and file employees were exempt from real property
tax pursuant to P.D. 745.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the proceedings in LBAA Cases Nos. 42 and 43
proceeded after which a<i> </i>decision was rendered affirming the taxability
of subject property of petitioner.  On
appeal, CBAA sustained the decision holding that the realty tax exemption under
P.D. 745 was withdrawn by P.D. 1955 and E.O. 93, so that petitioner should have
applied for restoration of the exemption with the Fiscal Incentives Review
Board (FIRB).  The decision of CBAA
clarified that Case No. 41 was different because it was effective <span style="">prior </span>to 1985, hence, was not covered
by P.D. 1955 nor by E.O. 93.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Petitioner moved for reconsideration but
was denied with CBAA holding that petitioner's "classification" of
P.D. 745 is unavailing because P.D. 1955 and E.O. 93 do not discriminate
against the so-called "social statutes".  Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Encapsulized, the issues raised in the petition are:  (1) whether respondent Assessors may validly
assess real property tax on the properties of petitioner considering the
proscription in The Local Tax Code (P.D. 231) and the Mineral Resources
Development Decree of 1974 (P.D. 463) against imposition of taxes on mines by
local governments; and, (2) whether the real tax exemption granted under P.D.
745 (promulgated July 15, 1975) was withdrawn by P.D. 1955 (took effect October
15, 1984) and E.O. 93.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Decree No. 745, particularly Sec. 3 thereof,
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 3.  Pursuant
to the above incentive, such domestic corporations and partnerships shall enjoy
tax exemption on:  <span style="">(a) </span>real estate taxes on the
improvements which will be used exclusively for housing their employees and
workers x x x <span style="">x"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Decree No. 1955, Sec. 1, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.  The
provisions of any special or general law to the contrary notwithstanding, all
exemptions from or any preferential treatment in the payment of duties, taxes,
fees, imposts and other charges heretofore granted to private business
enterprises and/or persons engaged in any economic activity are hereby
withdrawn, except those enjoyed by the following:  x x x x (e) Those that will be approved by the President of the
Philippines upon the recommendation of the Minister of Finance,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">should be read in connection with
Ministry Order No. 39-84, Sec. 1 (d), of the then Ministry of Finance, which
took effect October 15, 1984, states:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.  The
withdrawal of exemptions from, or any preferential treatment in, the payment of
duties, taxes, fees, imposts and other charges as provided for under
Presidential Decree No. 1955, does not apply to exemptions or preferential
treatment embodied in the following laws:  x x x x (d) The Real Property Tax Code x x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Executive Order No. 93, promulgated December 17, 1986, is also to
the same effect.  Both P.D. 1955 and
E.O. 93 operate as wholesale withdrawal of tax incentives granted to private
entities so that the government may re-examine existing tax exemptions and
restore through the "review mechanism" of the Fiscal Incentives
Review Board only those that are consistent with declared economic policy.   Thuswise, the chief revenue source of the
government will not be greatly, if not unnecessarily, eroded since tax
exemptions that were granted on piecemeal basis, and which have lost relevance
to existing programs, are eliminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, petitioner contends that local government
units are without any authority to levy realty taxes on mines pursuant to Sec.
52 of P.D. 463, which states:</p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 52. <i>Power to Levy Taxes on Mines, Mining Operations and
Mineral Products. </i>- Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, no province,
city, municipality, barrio or municipal district shall levy and collect taxes,
fees, rentals, royalties or charges of any kind whatsoever on mines, mining
claims, mineral products, or any operation, process or activity connected therewith,”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and Sec. 5 (m) of The Local Tax Code, as
amended by P.D. 426 (reiterated in Secs. 17 [d] and 22 [c], same Code), which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 5.  <i>Common
limitations on the taxing powers of local governments.</i> - The exercise of
the taxing powers of provinces, cities, municipalities and barrios shall not
extend to the imposition of the following:  x x x x (m) Taxes on mines; mining operations; and minerals, mineral
products, and their by-products when sold domestically by the operator x x x
x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General observes that the petitioner is estopped
from raising the question of lack of authority to issue the challenged
assessments inasmuch as it was never raised before, hence, not passed upon by,
the municipal and provincial assessors, LBAA and CBAA.   This observation is well taken.  The rule that the issue of jurisdiction over
subject matter may be raised anytime, even during appeal, has been qualified
where its application results in mockery of the tenets of fair play, as in this
case when the issue could have been disposed of earlier and more
authoritatively by any of the respondents who are supposed to be experts in the
field of realty tax assessment.  As We
held in <i>Suarez v. Court of Appeals</i><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x x It is settled that any decision rendered without
jurisdiction is a total nullity and may be struck down at any time, even on
appeal before this Court.  <i>The only
exception is where the party raising the issue is barred by estoppel </i>(<b>Tijam
v. Sibonghanoy,</b> 23 SCRA 29, reiterated in <b>Solid Homes, Inc. v. Payawal
and Court of Appeals,</b> G.R. No. 84811, August 29, 1989; underscoring
supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While petitioner could have prevented the trial court from
exercising jurisdiction over the case by seasonably taking exception thereto,
they instead invoked the very same jurisdiction by filing an answer and seeking
affirmative relief from it.  What is
more, they participated in the trial of the case by cross-examining
respondent.  Upon the premises,
petitioner cannot now be allowed belatedly to adopt an inconsistent posture by
attacking the jurisdiction of the court to which they had submitted themselves
voluntarily (<i>Tijam v. Sibonghanoy, supra</i>)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Aguinaldo Industries Corporation v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue and the Court of Tax Appeals,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> We
held:</p>

<blockquote>"To allow a litigant to assume a different posture when he
comes before the court and challenge the position he had accepted at the
administrative level, would be to sanction a procedure whereby the court -
which is supposed to <i>review</i> administrative determinations - would not
review, but determine and decide for the first time, a question not raised at
the administrative forum.  This cannot
be permitted, for the same reason that underlies the requirement of prior
exhaustion of administrative remedies to give administrative authorities the
prior opportunity to decide controversies within its competence, and in much
the same way that, on the judicial level, issues not raised in the lower court
cannot be raised for the first time on appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> is
available to pass upon the determinations of administrative bodies where patent
denial of due process is alleged as a consequence of grave abuse of discretion
or lack of jurisdiction, or question of law is raised and no appeal is
available.  In this case, petitioner may
not complain of denial of due process since it had enough opportunity, but
opted not, to raise the issue of jurisdiction in any of the administrative
bodies to which the case may have been brought.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that realty taxes are local taxes because they
are levied by local government units, citing Sec. 39 of P.D. 464, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 39.  <i>Rates of
Levy</i>. - The provincial, city or municipal board or council shall fix a
uniform rate of real property tax applicable to their respective localities x x
x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While local government units are charged with fixing the rate of
real property taxes, it does not necessarily follow from that authority the
determination of whether or not to impose the tax.  In fact, local governments have no alternative but to collect
taxes as mandated in Sec. 38 of the Real Property Tax Code, which states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 38.  <i>Incidence
of Real Property Tax</i>. - There shall be levied, assessed and collected in
all provinces, cities and municipalities an annual <i>ad valorem</i> tax on
real property, such as land, buildings, machinery and other improvements
affixed or attached to real property not hereinafter specifically
exempted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear from the foregoing that it is the national
government, expressing itself through the legislative branch, that levies the
real property tax.  Consequently, when
local governments are required to fix the rates, they are merely constituted as
agents of the national government in the enforcement of the Real Property Tax
Code.  The delegation of taxing power is
not even involved here because the national government has already imposed
realty tax in Sec. 38 above-quoted, leaving only the enforcement to be done by
local governments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The challenge of petitioner against the applicability of <i>Meralco
Securities Industrial Corporation v. Central Board of Assessment Appeals, et
al.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
is unavailing, absent any cogent reason to overturn the same.  Thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Meralco Securities argues that the realty tax is a local tax
or levy and not a tax of general application.  This argument is untenable because the realty tax has always been
imposed by the lawmaking body and later by the President of the Philippines in
the exercise of his lawmaking powers, as shown in Sections 342 <i>et</i> <i>seq</i>.
of the Revised Administrative Code, Act No. 3995, Commonwealth Act No. 470 and
Presidential Decree No. 464.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The realty tax is enforced throughout the Philippines and not
merely in a particular municipality or city but the proceeds of the tax accrue
to the province, city, municipality and barrio where the realty taxed is
situated (Sec. 86, P.D. No. 464).  In
contrast, a local tax is imposed by the municipal or city council by virtue of
the Local Tax Code, Presidential Decree No. 231, which took effect on July 1,
1973 (69 O.G. 6197)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the provisions of Sec. 52 of the Mineral Resources
Development Decree of 1974 (P.D. 463), and Secs. 5 (m), 17 (d) and 22 (c) of
The Local Tax Code (P.D. 231) cited by petitioner are mere limitations on the
taxing power of local government units; they are not pertinent to the issue
before Us and, therefore, cannot and should not affect the imposition of real
property tax by the national government.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second issue, petitioner, which claims that E.O.
93 does not repeal social statutes like P.D. 745, in the same breath takes
refuge in Sec. 1 (e) of the same E.O. 93, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.  The
provisions of any general or special law to the contrary notwithstanding, all
tax and duty incentives granted to government and private entities are hereby
withdrawn except:  x x x x (e) those
conferred under the four basic codes, namely:  x x x x (iv) the Real Property Tax Code, as amended x x x x" </blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">in relation to Sec. 40 of the Real
Property Tax Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 40. <i>Exemptions from Real Property Tax</i>. - The
exemption shall be as follows:  x x x x
(g) Real property exempt under other laws,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and concluding that P.D. 745 is one of
the "other laws" referred to.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.  If We
are to sanction this interpretation, then necessarily all real properties
exempt by any law would be covered, and there would be no need for the
legislature to specify "Real Property Tax Code, as amended", instead
of stating clearly "realty tax exemption laws".  Indubitably, the intention is to limit the
application of the "exception clause" only to those conferred by the
Real Property Tax Code.  This is not
only a logical construction of the provisions but more so in keeping with the
principle of statutory construction that tax exemptions are construed strictly
against taxpayers, hence, they cannot be created by mere implication but must
be clearly provided by law.  Non-exemption, in case of doubt, is favored.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quite obviously, the exception in Sec. 1 (e), (iv), of E.O. 93,
refers to "those conferred under x x x x Real Property Tax Code, as
amended", and that the exemption claimed by petitioner is granted not by
the Real Property Tax Code but by P.D. 745.  When Sec. 40 (g) of the Property Tax Code provides that "[T]he
exemption shall be as follows:  x x x x
Real Property exempt under other laws", the Code merely recognizes realty
tax exemptions provided by other laws, otherwise, it may unwittingly repeal
those "other laws".</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument of petitioner that P.D. 745 is a social statute to
give flesh to the Constitutional provisions on housing, hence, not covered by
P.D. 1955, was squarely met by respondent CBAA in its Resolution of July 1,
1991, to which We fully agree -</p>

<blockquote>"The phrase ‘any special or general law’ explicitly indicates
that P.D. No. 1955 did not distinguish between a social statute and an economic
or tax legislation.  Hence, where the
law does not distinguish, we cannot distinguish.  In view thereof, we have no recourse but to apply the express
provision of P.D. No. 1955 and rule in favor of the withdrawal of the real
property tax exemption provided under P.D. No. 745.  We also find without merit the contention of Petitioner-Appellant
that B.P. No. 391 (Investment Incentives Policy Act of 1983) is the source and
reason for the existence of P.D. No. 1955; therefore, the scope of P.D. No.
1955 is limited to investment incentives.  Although Section 20 of said B.P. which authorizes the President to
restructure investment incentives systems/legislations to align them with the
overall economic development objectives is one of the declared policies of P.D.
No. 1955, its primary aim is the formulation of national recovery program to
meet and overcome the grave emergency arising from the current economic crisis.  Hence, it cannot be maintained that its
provisions apply only to investment incentives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Besides, even granting that its scope is
limited, it is noted that P.D. No. 745 also speaks of investment incentives in
Sections 2 and 3 thereof x x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In fine, despite the spirited effort put up by petitioner, We
find no compelling reason to disturb the findings and conclusion of public
respondents.  Petitioner, which even
changed theories midstream, utterly failed to show that respondents, in issuing
the challenged Decision and Resolution, committed grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for lack of merit, the instant petition is
dismissed, with costs against petitioner.</p>
