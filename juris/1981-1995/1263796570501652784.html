				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court

The case was certified to this Court on January 19, 1985 following the death
sentences imposed on each of the three accused-appellants, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span>, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cademas</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span> (the

we, on May 14, 1987, issued a <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>resolution</b>

<p class="BODY">The four accused entered identical "not guilty" pleas.</p>

<p class="2Q">FOREGOING CONSIDERED, and on the part of accused ANACLETO Q. OLVIS,
SR., there being no evidence, direct or indirect, whether testimonial,
documentary or physical evidence, <span class="GramE">that tend</span> to establish

ACQUITTED.</p>

<p class="2Q">On the part of the three (3) remaining accused ROMULO VILLAROJO,

this case of MURDER.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But said offense
was attended by the aggravating circumstances of superior strength and

<p class="BODY">We come to the facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1975</st1:date>,
Alfredo and <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span>,
brother and sister, arrived at the local Integrated National Police station of
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> Norte, to report their brother, <span class="SpellE">Deosdedit</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span>, missing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The station commander, Captain <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Encabo</span>, received their
report.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bagon</span> had been in fact missing since
two days before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was last seen by his
wife in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="9">September 7,
 1975</st1:date>, on his way home to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sebaca</span> where they resided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She did not, however, find him there when she arrived in the
evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She then set out to locate him
in three probable places, but her efforts were in vain.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was Captain <span class="SpellE">Encabo</span> himself who led a
search party to mount an inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of police procedure, the team headed off to <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sebaca</span> to question possible witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There, Captain <span class="SpellE">Encabo's</span>
men chanced upon an unnamed volunteer, who informed them that <span class="SpellE">Deosdedit</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span> was last seen
together with <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span>,
one of the accused herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Encabo</span> then instructed one of his patrolmen to pick up <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sorela</span> bore several scratches on his
face, neck, and arms when the police found him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to him, he sustained those wounds while clearing his <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
unconvinced, Captain <span class="SpellE">Encabo</span> had <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span>
take them to the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> where he sustained his
injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But half way there, <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span> allegedly broke down, and, in what would apparently
crack the case for the police, admitted having participated in the killing of
the missing <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By then, the police of <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span> knew that they
had a murder case in their hands.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sorela</span> allegedly confessed having been
with <span class="SpellE">Deosdedit</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span>, a
friend of his, in the evening of <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="9">September
 7, 1975</st1:date> in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sebaca</span>
after some marketing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were met by <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span> and Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cademas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorela's</span> co-accused
herein and likewise friends of the deceased, who led them to a secluded place
in the <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It does not appear from the records how the three were able to have the
deceased join them.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was then that <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span> allegedly
attacked <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span> with a bolo, hacking him at several
parts of the body until he, <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span>, was dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moments later, <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span>
fled, running into thick cogon grasses where he suffered facial and bodily
scratches.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police soon picked up <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Cademas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Together with <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span>, they were turned over to
the custody of Captain <span class="SpellE">Encabo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police thereafter made the three re-enact the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Capito</span> directed <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span> to lead
them to the grounds where <span class="SpellE">Deosdedit</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span> was supposed to have been buried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it was <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span>
who escorted them to a watery spot somewhere in the <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span>,
where the sack-covered, decomposing cadaver of <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span>
lay in a shallow grave.</p>

<p class="BODY">The actual exhumation of the body of the victim was witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span> policemen and Civilian Home Defense Forces
volunteers, numbering about thirty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
body was transported to the <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span> municipal hall
the following day, <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was displayed, morbidly, in front of the
building where Mrs. Catalina <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span>, widow of the
deceased, and her four children viewed it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="GramE">exhumation, as well as the transfer of <span class="SpellE">Bagon's</span> cadaver, were</span> captured by the lens of a
photographer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Exhibits
"I", "J", "K", "L", "M", and
"N").</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The "ceremonies" continued in the parish church of the <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span>, where the body of the victim was transferred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was laid on the altar, in full public
view.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, the proceedings were
recorded by the camera of a photographer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibits "Q”, "R", "S".)</p>

<p class="BODY">But it was only later on that the body itself was uncovered from
the sack that had concealed it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibits "T", "U", "V".) Thereupon, it
was readied for autopsy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The necropsy report prepared by the provincial health officer
disclosed that the deceased suffered twelve stab and hack wounds, six of which
were determined to be fatal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the re-enactment, the suspects, the three accused herein,
demonstrated how the victim was <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> to death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "Y", a photograph, shows
the appellant <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span> in the posture of raising a
bolo as if to strike another, while <span class="SpellE">Solera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cademas</span> look on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibit "X", another photograph, portrays <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span>
in the act of concealing the murder weapon behind a banana tree, apparently
after having done the victim in.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigation yielded several effects of the offense:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a twenty-inch long bolo, the shovel used to
inter the victim's remains, a nylon rope with which the dead body was tied, and
the sack itself.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Initial findings of
investigators disclosed that the threesome of <span class="SpellE">Solera</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Cademas</span>
executed <span class="SpellE">Deosdedit</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span> on
orders of <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>,
then <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span> municipal mayor, for a reward of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> each.</p>

<p class="BODY">While in custody, the three executed five separate written
confessions each.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first confessions
were taken on <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1975</st1:date>
in the local Philippine Constabulary headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second were made before the <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span> police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1975</st1:date>, the three accused
reiterated the same confessions before the National Bureau of Investigation <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City sub-office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1975</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1975</st1:date>,
they executed two confessions more, again before the Philippine Constabulary
and the police of <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their confessions of <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1975</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="9">September 14,
 1975</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1975</st1:date>,
and <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1975</st1:date>, the
said accused again pointed to the then accused <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Olvis</span> as principal by inducement, who allegedly
promised them a reward of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> each.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their confessions of <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="9">September
 18, 1975</st1:date>, sworn before agents of the National Bureau of
Investigation, however, they categorically denied <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>'
involvement in the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note that
the three were transported to the <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City NBI
sub-office following a request on <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="9">September
 10, 1975</st1:date> by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Diolinda</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Adaro</span>, daughter of <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>, and
upon complaint by her of harassment against her father by his supposed
political enemies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on these subsequent statements, the court <b>a quo</b>
rendered separate verdicts on the three accused on the one hand, and <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span> on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>
was acquitted, while the three were all sentenced to die for the crime of
murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In acquitting <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>, the trial court
rejected the three <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> earlier confessions
pointing to him as the mastermind, and denied the admissibility thereof insofar
as far as he was concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It rejected
claims of witnesses that the three accused-appellants would carry out <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>' alleged order to kill <span class="SpellE">Bagon</span>
upon an offer of a reward when in fact no money changed hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It likewise noted that <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>
had, two days after the murder, been in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City,
and who, upon arriving in <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City, was in fact
informed by the Philippine Constabulary that he was a “wanted” man, "to
which said accused (<span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>) meekly complied"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
(that is, he assented, ambiguously, to the remark).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the court, this was inconsistent
with a guilty mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court repudiated claims that <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>
had motives to do away with the deceased arising from alleged attempts on his (<span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>') part to eject the deceased from his landholding
(the deceased having been a tenant of his), the case in fact having reached the
then Ministry of Agrarian Reform.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
dismissed insinuations that his children had a score to settle with the victim,
who had earlier brought a physical injuries suit against the former, that case
having been dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It observed,
furthermore, that he was not questioned by the police after the killing,
notwithstanding efforts by the three herein accused-appellants to implicate
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It relied, finally, on the
retraction of the accused themselves, absolving <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>
of any liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was satisfied,
overall, that he had a "clean bill of health"<a style="mso-footnote-id:

in connection with the murder case.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the acquittal of <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>, we are
left with the murder cases against the three accused-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellants <span class="SpellE">subsequenty</span>
repudiated their alleged confessions in open court alleging threats by the <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span> investigators of physical harm if they refused to
"cooperate" in the solution of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They likewise alleged that they were instructed
by the <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span> police investi­gators to implicate <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span> in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They insisted on their innocence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span> averred, specifically, that it was the deceased

<p class="3Q">"At the outset, if a person in custody is to be subjected to
interrogation, he must first be informed in clear and unequivocal terms that he
has the right to remain silent.</p>

<p class="3Q">"For those unaware of the privilege, the warning is needed
simply to make them aware of it - the threshold requirement for an intelligent
decision as to its exercise.</p>

<p class="3Q">"More important, such a warning is an absolute pre-requisite
in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere ...</p>

<p class="3Q">"Further, the warning will show the individual that his
interrogators are prepared to recognize his privilege should he choose to
exercise it ...</p>

<p class="3Q">"The warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied
by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the
individual in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This warning is
needed in order to make him aware not only of the privilege, but also of the
consequences of foregoing it …</p>

<p class="3Q">"An individual need not make a pre-interrogation request for a
lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While such request affirmatively
secures his right to have one, his failure to ask for a lawyer does not
constitute a waiver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No effective waiver
of the right to counsel during interrogation can be recognized unless
specifically made after the warnings we here delineate have been given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused who does not know his rights and
therefore does not make a request may be the person who most needs <span class="GramE">counsel ...</span></p>

<p class="3Q">"If an individual indicates that he wishes the assistance of counsel
before any interrogation occurs, the authorities cannot rationally ignore or
deny his request on the basis that the individual does not have or cannot
afford a retained attorney ...</p>

<p class="3Q">"In order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the extent
of his rights under this system then, it is necessary to warn him not only that
he has the right to consult with an attorney, but also that if he is indigent a
lawyer will be appointed to represent him ...</p>

<p class="3Q">"Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is
clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the individual indicates in
any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to
remain silent, the interrogation must cease ...<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the individual cannot obtain an attorney and he indicates that he
wants one before speaking to police, they must respect his decision to remain <span class="GramE">silent ...</span></p>

<p class="3Q">"If the interrogation continues without the presence of an
attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to
demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege

<p class="BODY">Like the <span class="SpellE"><b>Decierdo</b></span> confessions,
the confessions in the case at bar suffer from a Constitutional infirmity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their supposed statements dated September
9, 14, and 21, 1975, the accused-appellants were not assisted by counsel when
they "waived" their rights to counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we said in <span class="SpellE"><b>Decierdo</b></span>,
the lack of counsel "makes [those] statement[s], in contemplation of law,

<p class="BODY">With respect to the confessions of September 18, 1975, while it
is stated therein that “[t]his Office had just requested the services of Atty.
NARVARO VELAR NAVARRO of the Citizens Legal Assistance Office, Department of

the same nonetheless call for a similar rejection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing there that would show that
Atty. Navarro was the accused-appellants' counsel of choice (specifically, the
appellant <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span>
who admitted therein having been the bolo-wielder).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it is clear <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that Atty. Navarro was summoned by the NBI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot therefore be said to have been
acting on behalf of the accused-appellants when he lent his presence at the
confession proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What we said in <b>People

applies with like force here:</p>

<p class="3Q">No custodial investigation shall be conducted unless it <span class="GramE">be</span> in the presence of counsel engaged by the person
arrested, by any person on his behalf, or appointed by the court upon petition
either of the detainee himself or by anyone on his behalf.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">We cast aside, for the same reason, the confessions of <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the accused-appellants were denied their right to counsel not
once, but twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We refer to the forced
re-enactment of the crime the three accused were made to perform shortly after
their apprehension.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forced re-enactments, like <span class="SpellE">uncounselled</span>
and coerced confessions come within the ban against self-incrimination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 1973 Constitution, the Charter prevailing
at the time of the proceedings below, says:</p>

<p class="3Q">No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This constitutional privilege has been defined as a protection
against testimonial compulsion,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
but this has since been extended to any <span class="GramE">evidence</span>
"communicative in nature"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
acquired under circumstances of duress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Essentially, the right is meant to "avoid and prohibit positively
the repetition and recurrence of the certainly inhuman procedure of compelling
a person, in a criminal or any other case, to furnish the missing evidence
necessary for his conviction."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
This was the lesson learned from the ancient days of the inquisition in which
accusation was equivalent to guilt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, an act, whether testimonial or passive, that would amount to disclosure
of incriminatory facts is covered by the inhibition of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">This should be distinguished, parenthetically, from mechanical
acts the accused is made to execute not meant to unearth undisclosed facts but
to ascertain physical attributes determinable by simple observation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This includes requiring the accused to submit
to a test to extract virus from his body,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
or compelling him to expectorate morphine from his mouth,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
or making her submit to a pregnancy test<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
or a <span class="SpellE">footprinting</span> test,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
or requiring him to take part in a police lineup in certain cases.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
In each case, the accused does not speak his guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not a prerequisite therefore that he be
provided with the guiding hand of counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">But a forced re-enactment is quite another thing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here, the accused is not merely required to
exhibit some physical characteristics; by and large, he is made to admit
criminal responsibility against his will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a police procedure just as condemnable as an <span class="SpellE">uncounselled</span>
confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, we hold that all evidence based on such a
re-enactment to be in violation of the Constitution and hence, incompetent
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be furthermore observed that the three accused-appellants
were in police custody when they took part in the re-enactment in
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is under such circumstances
that the Constitution holds a strict application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As for the accused <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sorela</span>, we cannot accept the trial judge's finding
that he acted "with unexpected spontaneity"<a style="mso-footnote-id:

 9, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is to be borne
in mind is that <span class="SpellE">Sorela</span> was himself under
custody.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any statement he might have
made thereafter is therefore subject to the Constitutional guaranty.</p>

<p class="3Q">By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law
enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise
deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">We indeed doubt whether <span class="SpellE">Sorela's</span>

<p class="3Q">Compulsion as it is understood here does not necessarily connote
the use of violence; it may be the product of unintentional statements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pressure which operates to overbear his will,
disable him from making a free and rational choice, or impair his capacity for
rational judgment would in our opinion be sufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So is moral coercion "tending to force
testimony from the unwilling lips of the defendant."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">In such a case, he should have been provided with counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the three accused-appellants had languished in jail for
one year and two months before the information was filed, and only after they
had gone to court on an application for <b>habeas corpus</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For if the authorities
truly had a case in their hands, we are puzzled why they, the accused, had to
be made to suffer preventive imprisonment for quite an enormous length of time.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, there are striking aspects in the case that we find
distressing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For one, there was no trace
of grief upon the faces of the deceased's bereaved relatives, more so his widow
and children, upon witnessing his cadaver -- wrapped in a sack and all -- although
it was supposedly the first time that they saw his remains after two days of
frantic search.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the victim was transferred to the municipal hall
building and then subsequently, to the parish church, again, for a
photographing session -- an unusual procedure -- when the perfunctory police
procedure should have been to bring the corpse to the health officer for
autopsy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was in fact only on September 10, 1975 that <span class="SpellE">Deosdedit</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagon's</span> remains were
unwrapped, at the parish church at that, as if pursuant to a script or as part
of some eerie ceremony.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the mind of this Court, the disposition of the case was
characterized by unusual grandstanding, for reasons as yet unclear to us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It leaves us with an uncomfortable impression
that each scene was an act in some contrived tragedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise find the authorities' haste in securing the accused <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>' acquittal, at the
expense of the present three accused, quite disconcerting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the three appellants
had initially implicated <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span> as the
mastermind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>
was never invited for the usual questioning.</p>

<p class="BODY">To us, there is more to Exhibit "20", the request to
transfer <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>' case to the jurisdiction of the
National Bureau of Investigation for reinvestigation, than meets the eye.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it happened, happily for <span class="SpellE">Olvis</span>, the three accused-appellants, while under NBI
custody, retracted their earlier statements indicting him as a
co-conspirator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why the NBI should
intervene in the case when the <span class="SpellE">Polanco</span> police had <span class="SpellE">apparenty</span> "solved" it, is, in the first place,
suspicious enough, but why the three appellants should, in an instant, make a
turn-about there leaves us even more disturbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we do not challenge the verdict of acquittal rendered in

But it is still our business to see whether his defense can stand scrutiny.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records will disclose that the deceased suffered twelve
assorted wounds caused by a sharp instrument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The assault severed his right hand and left his head almost separated
from his body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This indicates a serious
intent to kill, rather than self-defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In finding that <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span> did take the
life of the victim, we cannot, however, appreciate superior strength or <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
qualifying circumstances were considered by the court <b>a quo</b> on the basis
of the extrajudicial statements executed by the accused, statements we reject
for the reasons earlier discussed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the absence of any other proof, the severity and number of wounds sustained by
the deceased are not, by themselves, sufficient proof to warrant the appreciation
of the generic aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Villarojo</span>
