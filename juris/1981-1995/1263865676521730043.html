<p class="BODY">Shortly before <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">noon</st1:time> of <st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1973">22 March 1973</st1:date>, while Connie was
attending to her mother who was confined at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Eddie and his mother came
for a visit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They brought with them the
papers granting the petition for the annulment of Eddie's marriage to Venus
Joy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the mother of <span style="">Connie </span>was <span style="">reading the said papers, Connie and Eddie slipped out of the room
unnoticed and went to the hospital chapel to say a few prayers, after which
Connie guided Eddie in a tour of the hospital premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the hospital lobby, Connie
decided to go back to her mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Eddie, however, chided her, saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Pambihira</span> ka <span class="SpellE">naman</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ngayon</span> <span class="SpellE">lang</span> <span class="SpellE">tayo</span>

mother <span style="">was </span>alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie told Connie, however, that they will
just fetch his sister <span class="SpellE">Cecille</span> from the <st1:place><st1:placename>Assumption</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place>, a few city blocks from the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie demurred saying that
she was not properly attired and was only wearing a pair of slippers, but Eddie
insisted, saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Susunduin</span> <span class="SpellE">natin</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cecille</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Babalik</span> <span class="SpellE">tayo</span> <span class="SpellE">agad</span>."
Eddie prevailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon boarding their
Kombi, which had, in the meantime, arrived at the front entrance of the
hospital, upon summons of Eddie, the latter told the driver:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Kay <span class="SpellE">Cecille</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But they did not go to <span class="SpellE">Cecille</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie was brought to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Baguio</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

After taking supper, Eddie <span style="">invited
Connie to </span><span style="">rest </span><span style="">in one of the rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, Connie refused, saying that she would
prefer to stay in the </span><span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Eddie held her by the arm and
dragged her inside a room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then tried
to force himself upon Connie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie
pleaded and begged that Eddie desist from doing what <span style="">he had in mind since they were getting married anyway, but, Eddie
ignored her entreaties and kept on forcing himself upon her.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The </span><span class="SpellE"><u>uncontroverted</u></span>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
what happened then after that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
that, he told me, '<span class="SpellE">Halika</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Matulog</span> ka <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">isang</span>
<span class="SpellE">cuarto</span>.' I told him to go ahead and I will stay where
I am and that I am not going to sleep there.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
time <span style="">was </span>this now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
<st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did the accused do when y<span style="">o</span>u told
him that you preferred to stay <span style="">in </span>the
<span class="SpellE">sala</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
said, '<span class="SpellE">Halika</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>', and he
was dragging me already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was holding
me by the arm and I resisted and said I will stay in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then he <span style="">was </span>dragging me already inside one of the two adjoining rooms
with a common toilet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And little by
little, he managed to drag me inside the room with two beds.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
what happened inside the room?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The struggle started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was trying to embrace and kiss me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was trying to hold my breast while we were
both standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on for sometime
and every now and then, he would sit on the bed and rest when he got tired
saying, '<span class="SpellE">Pinahihirapan</span> mo <span class="SpellE">ako</span>
<span class="SpellE">talaga</span>.' Then he would continue again and in one
renewed struggle, he dragged me and pulled me into the bed with him but I
succeeded in warding him of (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
while you<span style=""> </span>were standing before he
dragged you into the bed when you were there inside the room, what were you
doing to ward of (sic) his attempts?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would push him away or hold his hand or
suddenly staying in a half-sitting position or I would hold on to my pants with
one hand and fought with him with the other hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, when he finally
succeeded in dragging you to the bed with him, what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
found an occasion wherein he was resting for a while because he got tired of
the struggle and I jumped out of bed and I went to the toilet and locked myself
inside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did the accused do when you did this?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
he realized what I was doing, he ran immediately but fortunately, I was already
inside the toilet and the door was locked already.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
stayed there for about an hour and heard him or after that I heard some
scratches or noise on the door knob.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the door knob fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he
placed it back again and …</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened when the door knob fell?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
ran into the room again but the struggle again started.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened back in the room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
was concentrating in removing my pants while we were standing and once he pulled
me into the bed with him putting both arms around my waist and he pulled me
into the bed with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on for
sometime and a struggle again continued and he was not able to succeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on for some time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems a long <span class="SpellE">long</span>
time and when he got tired, he would just lie back and catch his breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this moment, this was around <st1:time hour="14" minute="0">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> or <st1:time hour="15" minute="0">3:00
 o'clock</st1:time> already, he was just lying there beside me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was breathing heavily and <span style="">then </span>he was breathing softly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I knew he was<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span>already asleep.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
when you realized at that point that the accused had fallen asleep, what did
you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
transferred to the other room and locked myself including the door in the
toilet leading to the other room where he was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I locked it inside and also the door in the corridor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
did you or what did you do in the other room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could not sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was fully awake <span style="">and my </span>mind was in circles and <span style="">I </span>was thinking about my mother, my parents what they would think
because of my disappearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, I was
trying to gather my thoughts whether they would come after me or had abandoned
me already.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so confused and I must
have dozed of for a few minutes and when I learned, I just saw the accused
besides (sic) me <span class="SpellE">fambling</span> with my pants again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pushed him away and the struggle started
again.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
what time was this again?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
<st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> or <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
think he entered the room through the corridor because he had the key may
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He opened it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
was about <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> or <st1:time hour="18" minute="0">6:00 o'clock</st1:time>, what date?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>March
23.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened when as you said you felt the accused <span class="SpellE">fambling</span>
with your pants?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The struggle again started and he pinned
me down with his full weight and he was pressing his forearm against my neck
under my chin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his right hand he
was <span class="SpellE">fambling</span> my bra at the back.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
he succeed in removing your bra?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No because the snap of my bra is in front
and he thought it was at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was looking at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, my
snap is at the front and he could not open.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was trying to remove my shirt but my shirt has no opening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a long sleeve T-shirt and he could not
pull it over or out of <span style="">my </span>head.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What happened then?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then he was starting to concentrate on my
pants but I was successful and he was not able to remove my pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was intermittent because he would just lie
back and catches (sic) his breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
this occasion, he was hopeless and he remained silent for a while and he said
that we were leaving soon as the <span class="SpellE">combi</span> arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he said this, I jumped <span style="">out of </span>the
bed and went out of (to) the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> <span style="">and </span>sat on one of the solo chairs
there.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
about the accused, what did he do when you jumped out of the bed as you said
and ran to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>?</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He was right behind me and followed
me <span style="">in </span>the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened then in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">I </span><span style="">learned that the driver arrived and </span>he <span style="">knocked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We waited there for
about an hour before the driver arrived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He knocked.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened during this hour that you were waiting for the driver?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As usual, he was saying the same
things all over again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
things?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That he love (sic) me, that how the entire
family was so proud of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he was
learning practically the business of his father very well and he asked me if I
don't love him anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said also
that anyway we are going to get married.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
were you doing or what did you say during this time?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
was just sitting there crying most of (the) time with my eyes closed and my
hands <span style="">over my eyes like this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Witness demonstrating).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, he would attempt to touch me on
the shoulder or on the face but I would push his hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would push his hand aside.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
what happened when the <span class="SpellE">combi</span> arrived?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He told the driver to buy some food to eat
at the grocery so we could bring it on our way home, or it (sic) on our way
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the driver went to the grocery
and arrived after about thirty minutes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He knocked at the door again and opened the door and then <span style="">he told the driver to bring his purchases in
the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he sent out again the
driver and locked the door.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He opened, - he said again that <span style="">we were </span>going to eat in the house
first before leaving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, he opened two
or three can <span style="">(sic) goods and started
eating.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What about you?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
did not <span style="">eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>I refused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you drink anything?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
I finished half of the glass of pine­apple juice which the accused prepared in
the kitchen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was
there anyone else in the house at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
one was at the house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
did anybody arrive while you were there in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
while the accused is (sic) eating?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, the woman caretaker knocked again
and so the accused opened the door a little and she said that she was able to
talk with Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> and that <span style="">Mrs. </span>de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>
said that we must go home at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
the accused must go home at once to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
but that he must call up first his mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And then the caretaker left and the accused <span style="">closed the </span>door again.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
did the accused phone <span style="">his </span>mother?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No,
<span style="">sir.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
happened after that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
eating to his heart's content, he sat back very leisurely on the sofa and then
he lighted a cigarette.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
about you, what were you doing there during this time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was just staring at him with increasing anger and hatred.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened then?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He would utter some remarks like.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Takot</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">takot</span> ka.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pambihira</span> ka <span class="SpellE">talaga</span> <span class="SpellE">oo</span>.'

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
about you, what were you doing a<span style="">t the </span>time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was glaring at him, looking at him with <span class="SpellE">dager</span> eyes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened after that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After that, he was trying to drag me again

because of the struggle and for not having eaten anything and for lack of
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was able to remove <span style="">my </span>pants and my panty together.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
what happened when your pants and panty were removed?</blockquote>

hand between them and stretching them.</blockquote>

what happened, <span style="">was </span>he able to
part your legs?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, what he did next <span style="">was </span>to go on top <span style="">of </span>me and stretched my legs apart with
his right hand and with his right leg and stretched it (sic) wider with his
knees which he planted between my legs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And then at the same time with his right hand, he <span style="">was </span>holding my neck, half strangling
me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How did the accused manage to part your legs?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He would start giving me fist blows so that
my legs would part and then he placed his knees between again and planted them
and stretched them wider.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Then
I felt his right hand going down to his penis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And at the time his face, his left face was
pressed against my neck under my chin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then he was guiding his penis inside to my organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I felt a stab of pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then the accused (sic) body was moving

docketed therein as Criminal Case No. 784(245), charging accused with the crime

<p class="BODY">When arraigned, the accused pleaded not guilty to the commission
of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the accused did
not take the witness stand to contradict or rebut the testimony of the
complainant as to the manner she was raped by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, instead, presented the love
letters sent to him by Connie, and the testimonies of the driver, Julian <span class="SpellE">Cartano</span>, and their neighbors in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Solano and Federico <span class="SpellE">Estoque</span>,
who both claimed to have seen the complainant and the accused holding each
other’s shoulders ("<span class="SpellE">magka-akbay</span>") and
talking and laughing like newly-weds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They also stated that they did not see any injuries on the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>have carefully gone over the voluminous record of the case and there is
nothing in it that would justify a <span style="">reversal or </span>change in the findings and
conclusions of the <span style="">trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
complainant appears to have testified in a forthright manner and her testimony <span style="">as </span>to the
manner she was raped by the appellant is, not only <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
by the appellant, but also supported by documentary and testimonial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lesions found in different
parts of her body and the torn dress she was wearing at the time of the attack
are ample proofs of <span style="">a </span>struggle
and resistance against the assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would also appear that the violation of her person and honor was immediately
reported to the police authorities and the complainant had no motive to falsely
accuse the appellant whom she had loved and would have married had it not been
for the happening of the lamentable and dastardly event.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the complainant had voluntarily consented to have sex with the
appellant, as the latter would want it to appear, her most natural reaction
would have been to conceal it or keep silent, as this would bring disgrace to
her honor and reputation, as well as to her family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps, she could have gone ahead and
married her boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the
complainant did not choose to be silent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She, instead, publicly and openly proclaimed the wrong done to her and
vehemently denounced the appellant, shutting out even the possibility of a
happy and blissful married life, and exposed herself to the ordeal and
embarrassment of a public trial and heaped upon herself unwanted humiliation.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the complainant, a respectable woman of good family
and breeding, would not have told a story of<span style=""> rape if such were </span>not <span style="">a </span>fact,
considering the dishonor, the <span style="">shame and
the </span>social humiliation that accompany the accus<span style="">ation and the </span>adverse effects upon <span style="">her very </span>future.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
if it were true that she had agreed to elope with the a<span style="">pp</span>ellant as to have sex with him, it is inconceivable that the
mere appearanc<span style="">e</span> of her sister,
Mrs. Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Antiporda</span>, who went to <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City in search for her and to arrange <span style="">for </span>her marriage to the appellant, if
necessary, should have changed her from a loving sweetheart to one who detested
her boyfriend and later accused him of such a beastly and shameful crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That unwavering and firm denunciation of the
appellant negates consent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ap<span style="">p</span>ellant, in
his Brief, contends that the trial court should not have given credence to the
testimony of the complainant that she had been raped by the appellant, pursuant
to the rule of "<span class="SpellE">Falsus</span> in <span class="SpellE">uno</span>,
<span class="SpellE">falsus</span> in omnibus," since the trial court itself
did not give weight and credence to her claim that she had been forcibly
abducted by the appellant from the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Medical
Center at <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule, however, is settled that courts may believe one part of
the testimony of a witness and disbelieve another part, and courts are not
required to accept or reject the whole of the testimony of <span style="">a </span>particular witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one case,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"There <span style="">is </span>nothing
improper or illegal in the actuation of the trial Court in partly crediting and
partly rejecting the testimonies of prosecu­tion witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significant is the fact that the trial Court
supported its findings <span style="">in </span>this
case <span style="">with the objective evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is perfectly reasonable for </span><span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">trier</span></span><span style=""> of facts to believe the testimony of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">witness with respect
to some facts and disbelieve it with respect to other facts in the
ascertainment of the truth."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also points at alleged defects in the testimony of
the complainant, which would render said testimony not worthy of credence, <span style="">to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie could not pinpoint the time she was
allegedly raped and had three different versions - one at around <st1:time hour="14" minute="0">2:00</st1:time> or <st1:time hour="15" minute="0">3:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date month="3" day="23" year="1973">March
 23, 1973</st1:date>, another at noontime of the same day, while <span style="">another was in the morning of the said day;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie testified that during the preliminary
investigation of the case, she presented to the Fiscal the clothes she was
wearing on<span style=""> the day she was raped but that
the Fiscal told her to just present them in court, whereas the Fiscal denied
said claim saying that all he received were sworn statements in support of the
complaint and the counter affidavit of the accused;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie’s claim that her clothes were torn
during the struggle was disproved when said clothes were presented and did not
show such kind of damage; there was only a separation of the seams ("<span class="SpellE">tastas</span>");<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie's claim that she did not know what to
do because that was the first time she was alone with Eddie <span style="">is </span>not true as she herself admitted
that she and Eddie went to La Mesa <span style="">Dam </span><span style="">by themselves on February 11, 1973;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie's claim that she had not seen Eddie
for four (4) months is also belied by her testimony that she saw Eddie on <st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1973">February 11, 1973</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie's claim that Eddie had tried to rape
her for 100 times is exaggerated;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(7)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Connie's claim that her panty <span style="">was </span>full of blood is belied by her
testimony that the blood did not seep through her pants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(8)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The leisurely trip of Connie and Eddie to the
Grotto in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> belies her claim that she was
raped by Eddie prior to such trip;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(9)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The romantic boating in the lagoon of <st1:place><st1:placename>Burnham</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>, after the alleged rape, also <span style="">n</span><span style="">egat</span><span style="">es</span><span style=""> complainant’s claim that she was </span><span style="">r</span><span style="">aped;</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(10) Connie's
refusal to go with the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City policemen<span style=""> </span>to the police headquarters runs
counter to her claim that she was raped by <span style="">Eddie; and</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(11) Connie's
testimony in court <span style="">is at variance </span>with
her affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 7).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These defects, however, refer to relatively minor details which
may be attributed to deficiencies <span style="">in </span>obser­vation
and recollection, or misapprehension of misleading, confusing and taxing
questions during cross-examination, but they do not indicate a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> attempt to commit a falsehood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the contradictory statements have
been satisfactorily explained by the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant explained the difference in her statement of the time
she was raped by the appellant, saying that she did not have a watch at the
time and she was preoccupied in trying to ward off the advances of the
appellant <span style="">as
</span>to <span style="">take
</span>notice of the precise time.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the complainant was very busy fending off the
appellant, it is indeed not improbable for her to have lost all <span class="SpellE">conciousness</span> of the passage of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the condition of the dress she was wearing at the time, it
is not really very material whether the fibers of her dress were broken or that
it was merely separated at the seams ("<span class="SpellE">tastas</span>").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Either condition conveys the same message and
that is, there was a struggle between the appellant and complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the <span style="">alleged
</span>inconsistency between the testimony of the complainant that her panty
was full of blood and her declaration that the blood in her panty did not seep
to her pants, the complainant explained that she found a napkin which she
placed on her private part to stem the flow of blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was
the bleeding of your vagina or private part <span class="SpellE">profused</span>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not so much but it was
really bleeding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
it even went through from the panty to <span style="">the
pants?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
your Honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found <span style="">a </span>napkin and I placed this
napkin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found one piece in the toilet
and I placed it because it was bleeding."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the complainant to shout for help or attempt <span style="">to escape </span>from the appellant has also
been satis­factorily explained by her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She declared that the appellant had threatened to leave her to fend for
herself in a strange place if she should make a scene or shout or do anything
against his wishes and she was afraid of what strangers might do to her if she
were alone.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, she was confused and did not know what to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She thought that it was the end of the world
for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt forlorn and abandoned
and even thought of marrying the appellant although she despised him for what
he had done to her.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

clothes and she did not know them to be policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Believing that they were strangers, she
really could not confides in them or relate to them her predicament and
tragedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was also afraid of falling
into the hands of other men who would rape her again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, she did not understand a word of
what they said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said the man was in civilian clothes and that you could not understand what
they were talking about, what happened after that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
man went near the door and was saying something to me but I did not understand
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I just kept silent.</blockquote>

why did you not step out of the room?</blockquote>

and the fear that the accused might have me kidnapped or pass me to another man

<p class="BODY">As for her going with the appellant to the Grotto at <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span> Road and then boating in the Burnham Park lake,
the complainant explained that she thought it best to go outside the house on
23 March 1973, rather than stay in the house where the appellant was trying
hard to force himself <span style="">again </span>on her for another sexual intercourse with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened after the <span style="">man </span>left?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
accused told me that we were going out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
what time was that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
<st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> past.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And did he say where you were going?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
he did not mention it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
did you not ask him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
did not or it did not matter anymore.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you go with him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
was much better than to stay in the house where he might attempt again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
did you go?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
told his driver to go to the Grotto.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where,
in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>?</blockquote>

he tell you why you were going there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
said we were going to pray but the car just went around and did not stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="">then
</span>he told the driver to go to <st1:place><st1:placename>Burnham</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place> and there he hired a boat and
he told me to go on it.</blockquote>

you get into the boat?</blockquote>

sir.</blockquote>

did not know where else to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
gathering my thoughts what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt that what had happened was the end of the world for <span style="">me </span>and I was feeling so alone and I was

<p class="BODY">With regard to variances in the testimony of the complainant and
her affidavit (Exhibit 7), suffice <span style="">it
to </span>state that "an affidavit, being taken <u>ex</u>–<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, is almost always incomplete and often
inaccurate, sometimes <span style="">from </span><span style="">p</span>a<span style="">rtial suggestion, sometimes for want of suggestions </span>and <span style="">inquiries, without the aid of which the
witness may be unable to recall the connected collateral circumstances
necessary for the correction of the first suggestion of his memory and for his
accurate recollection of all that belongs to the subject."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also <span style="">assails </span>the trial court for not giving due
weight and credence to the testimonies of defense witnesses Julian <span class="SpellE">Cartano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Solano and
Federico <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Estoque</span></span><span style=""> </span>who claimed to have seen the
complainant and the appellant holding each other's shoulders ("<span class="SpellE">magka-akbay</span>") and talking and laughing like
newly-weds, and that they did not see any injuries on the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be denied, however, that only the complainant and the
appellant, and no other, can testify to the rape committed in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the testimonies of the defense
witnesses who did not actually see the commission of the offense cannot prevail
over the positive testi­mony of the complainant that she was raped by the
appellant with a full and straight-forward revelation of its details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is possible that the defense
witnesses could not have seen the injuries sustained by the complainant since
the injuries on her breast, thigh and private part were amply covered by her
clothes while the injuries on her neck <span style="">were </span>covered by her long hair.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Going over the voluminous record of the case, the Court cannot
escape the thought that there had surged an <span style="">over-</span><span style="">powerin</span>g<span style=""> </span>fit of
passion which blinded the appellant and led him to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was he overcome by bestial instinct?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or was he provoked or incited to execute the
act?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the appellant knows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, he did not take the witness
stand to explain his side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we cannot
hold this against him, for an accused has the right to remain silent and no <span style="">adverse </span>inference should be drawn from
that silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, settled is the
rule that in order to gain conviction, the prosecution must rely on the
strength of its evidence rather than on the weakness of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the Court is satisfied
that the guilt of the appellant has been proven with moral certainty and beyond
reasonable doubt; hence, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>
