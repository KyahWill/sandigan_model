<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1977</st1:date>,
TUPAS filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">a </span>petition for the
conduct <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of a </span>certification
election with Regional Office No. <span class="GramE">IV of the Department of Labor
in order to determine the exclusive bargaining representative of the workers in
NHC.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was claimed that its
members comprised the majority of the employees of the corporation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

The petition was dismissed by med-arbiter <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> M.
Jimenez in an order, dated November 7, 1977, holding that NHC "being a
government-owned and/or controlled corporation its employees/workers are
prohibited to form, join or assist any labor organization for purposes of
collective bargaining pursuant to Section 1, Rule II, Book V of the Rules and
Regulations implementing the Labor Code."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From this order of dismissal, TUPAS appealed to the Bureau of

upon a motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">for </span>reconsideration
of respondent NHC.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>, TUPAS seeks the
reversal of the said resolution and prays that a certification election be held
among the rank and file employees of NHC.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In retrospect, it will be recalled that in a former case of
illegal dismissal involving the same respondent corporation,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
We had ruled that the employees of NHC and of other government owned or
controlled corporations were governed by civil service laws, rules and
regulations pursuant to the 1973 Constitution which provided that "the
civil service embraces every branch, agency, subdivision and instrumentality of
the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was therein stressed that to allow subsidiary corporations to
be excluded from the civil service laws would be to permit the circumvention or
emasculation of the above-quoted constitutional provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As perceptively analyzed therein, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span><span class="GramE">)t</span> would be possible for a
regular ministry of government to create a host of subsidiary corporations
under the Corporation Code funded by a willing legislature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A government-owned corporation could create
several subsidiary corporations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
subsidiary corporations would enjoy the <span class="GramE">best</span> of two
worlds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their officials and employees
would be privileged individuals, free from the strict accountability required
by the Civil Service Decree and the regulations of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Commission on Audit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
incomes would not be </span>subject <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
the competitive restraints of the open market nor to the terms and conditions
of civil service employment."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule, however, was modified in the 1987 Constitution, the
corresponding provision whereof declares that "(t)he civil service
embraces <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">all </span>branches,
subdivisions, instrumentalities and agencies of the government, including
government-owned or controlled corporations with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">original </span>charters."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the civil service now covers only government-owned
or controlled corporations with original or legislative charters, that <span class="GramE">is</span> those created by an act of Congress or by special law,
and not those incorporated under and pursuant to a general legislation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As We recently held -<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

include government-owned or controlled corporations which are organized as

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">While the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>

determinative of the present special civil action was involved therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The workers or employees of NHC undoubtedly have the right to
form unions or employees' organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The right to unionize or to form organizations is now explicitly
recognized and granted to employees in both the governmental and the private
sectors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Bill of Rights provides
that "(t)he right of the people, including those employed in the public
and private sectors, to form unions, associations or societies for purposes not
contrary to law shall not be abridged."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This guarantee is reiterated in the second paragraph of Section
3, Article XIII, on Social Justice and Human Rights, which mandates that the
State "shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective
bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the
right to strike in accordance with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically with respect to government employees, the right to
unionize is recognized in Paragraph (5), Section 2, Article IX B<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

which provides that "(t<span class="GramE">)he</span> right to
self-organization shall not be denied to government employees." The
rationale of and justification for this innovation which found expression in
the aforesaid provision was explained by its proponents, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> government is in a sense the
repository of the national sovereignty and, in that respect, it must be held <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>reverence if not in awe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It symbolizes the unity of the nation, but it
does perform a mundane task as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is an employer in every sense of the word except that terms and conditions of
work are set forth through a Civil Service Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The government is the biggest employer in the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is an employer-employee relationship
and we all know that the accumulated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">grievances
of several decades are now beginning to explode in our faces among government
workers who feel that the rights afforded by the Labor Code, for example, to
workers in the private sector have been effectively denied to workers in
government in what looks like a grotesque, (sic) a caricature of the equal
protection </span>of the laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
example, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> there were
many occasions under the old government when wages and cost of living
allowances were granted to workers in the private sector but denied to workers
in the government for some reason or another, and the government did not even
state the reasons why.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The government
employees were being discriminated against.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a general rule, the majority of the world's countries now entertain
public service unions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What they really
add up to is that the employees <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the
government form </span>their own association.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Generally, they do not bargain
for wages because </span>these are fixed in the budget but they do acquire a
forum where, among other things, professional and self-development is (sic) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">pro</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">moted and encouraged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also
act as watchdogs of their own bosses so that when graft and </span>corruption
is committed, generally, it is the unions who are no longer afraid by virtue of
the armor of self-organization that become the public's own allies for
detecting graft and corruption and for exposing it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, no impediment to the holding <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of a certification election among the workers
of NHC for it is clear that they are covered by the Labor Code, the NHC being a
government-owned and/or controlled corporation without an original
charter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Statutory implementation of the
last-cited section of the Constitution is found in Article 244 of the Labor
Code, as amended by Executive Order No. 111, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"<u>Right of employees
in the public service.</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- </span>Employees
of the government corporations established under the Corporation Code shall
have the right to organize and to bargain collectively with their respective
employers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All other employees in the
civil service shall have the right to form associations for purposes not
contrary to law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The records do not show that supervening factual events have
mooted the present action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is meet,
however, to also call attention to the fact that, insofar as certification
elections are concerned, subsequent statutory developments have rendered
academic even the distinction between the two types of government-owned or
controlled corporations and the laws governing employment relations therein, as
hereinbefore discussed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, whether the
employees of NHC are covered by the Labor Code or by the civil service laws, a
certification election may be conducted.</p>

<p class="BODY">For employees in corporations and entities covered by the Labor
Code, the determination of the exclusive bargaining representative is
particularly governed by Articles 255 to 259 of said Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 256 provides for the procedure when
there is a representation issue in organized establishments, while Article 257
covers unorganized establishments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
Labor Code provisions are fleshed out by Rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">V </span>to VII, Book V of the Omnibus Implementing Rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to other civil servants, that is, employees of all
branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities and agencies of the government
including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters
and who are, therefore, covered by the civil service laws, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the guidelines for the exercise of their
right to organize is provided for under Executive Order No. 180.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Chapter IV thereof, consisting of Sections 9
to 12, regulates the determination of the "sole and exclusive employees'
representative." Under Section 12, "where there are two or more duly
registered employees' organizations in the appropriate organizational unit, the
Bureau of Labor Relations shall, upon petition, order the conduct of
certification election and shall certify the winner as the exclusive
representative of the rank-and-file employees in said organizational
unit."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
