Mercader in the Regional Trial Court of Cebu against Leandro Alazas and Dioscoro
Lazaro, a decision was rendered on November 4, 1982 ordering said defendants to
pay plaintiff solidarily the sums of P200,000.00 moral damages, P10,000.00
attorneyâ€™s fees, P5,000.00 litigation expenses and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Intermediate Appellate

Dioscoro Lazaro was dismissed but the decision was affirmed with costs against
Leandro Alazas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the case was
elevated to this Court, the decision was modified by way of a reduction of the
moral damages to P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On May 6, 1988 Mercader
wrote the President and Board of Directors of Gala Inc. informing them of the
two (2) auction sales where she acquired sufficient shares of stocks of Leandro
Alazas to become a majority stockholder of the corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, he wrote Mr. Axel Alazas,
secretary of Gala Inc., to furnish him copies of the minutes of the board
meetings during the year as well as the stockholders' meetings for 1988.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On May 24, 1988 Mercader
filed a motion for examination of Alazas in the trial court stating that except
for the 1,580 shares of stocks of Alazas in Gala Inc. which was sold to
Mercader by the sheriff for P47,400.00 in partial satisfaction of the judgment,
no other personal or real properties could be found by the sheriff which
plaintiff believes defendant Alazas has cleverly hidden/concealed so that he
asks that Alazas be made to appear to be examined under oath as to his property
and source of income in accordance with Section 39 of Rule 39, Rules of
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted on the
same day so the examination of the defendant was scheduled for </span><st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">May 30,

Alazas, cashier, treasurer and assistant treasurer, respectively, of Gala <u>Enterprises</u>
to bring along with them the minutes of meetings of the stockholders and board
of directors, stock and transfer books, and financial statement with balance
sheet of said enterprise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Defendant Alazas filed a
motion for reconsideration alleging that upon full satisfaction of the judgment
by the writ of execution and by the entry of judgment, the trial court has lost
jurisdiction over the case except as to its ministerial function relating to
the issuance of the writ of execution thus the trial court has lost
jurisdiction to act further on the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An opposition thereto was filed by counsel for plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied in an order </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">dated </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">June 6, 1988 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and the
examination of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">defendant was
reset for June 20, 1988 at 8:30 o'clock in the morning, the trial court taking
note of the statement made by Marilou Valmores, cashier of Gala Inc., that as
of October 17, 1982 Leandro Alazas owned only one (1) share of stock worth
P100.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Hence, the herein
petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with a prayer for the issuance
of a temporary restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction filed by
Alazas wherein it is alleged that the judgment of the trial court as modified
by the Supreme Court having become final and executory, the trial court has
lost jurisdiction over the case except as to the ministerial act of ordering
the execution of the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Alazas </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

beyond review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis thereof
petitioner seeks to restrain the trial court from conducting its examination of
petitioner as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">judgment debtor and to annul all proceedings
and orders issued in connection therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">June 29,
 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, without giving
due course to the petition, the Court required respondents to comment thereon </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">within ten (10) days from notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court also resolved to issue a temporary
restraining order enjoining the trial court judge from proceeding in any manner
with the incident dealt with in his order dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">June 6, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> or otherwise enforcing said order or orders
relative to the same incident in Civil Case No. R16623.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The comment having been
filed and petitioner not having filed its reply as required by the Court, the
case is now submitted for decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The petition is devoid of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is true that when a judgment
has become final and executory all that is left of the trial court is the
ministerial act of ordering the execution of the judgment and that after such
judgment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">has </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">been fully satisfied, the case is deemed terminated
once and for all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in this case,
while it appears that after two (2) public auction sales of the alleged shares
of stock of petitioner in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Gala </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Inc. had been undertaken wherein private
respondent was the successful bidder so that the judgment was deemed fully
satisfied, it nevertheless appears from the repeated representations of certain
officers of Gala Inc., that he owns only one (1) share of stock worth P100.00
in Gala Inc..<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If this is so then there
is every reason for the private respondent to ask the trial court to issue the
order for the examination of the petitioner as judgment debtor under Section 39
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Rule 39, Rules of Court, so that the trial court may determine </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">if </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">there are any credits, money and property of the judgment debtor in the
possession or control of such person, corporation or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">legal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">entity that may answer for the unsatisfied judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is of no moment if there was an error in the reference by the
trial court to Gala <u>Enterprises</u> which is a non-existent corporation, as
it is a clerical error, referring in fact to Gala Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The situation in this case is paradoxical in that while
petitioner claims that the judgment has been fully satisfied, on the other hand
the representatives of Gala Inc. assert that he had only one (1) share left to
his name when the judgment was executed, thus the judgment against him remains
unsatisfied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pretension that his
shares of stock have been sold may be a ruse or clever scheme in order <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to evade the execution of the judgment
thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The examination of petitioner
as judgment debtor is in order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
process is within the competence of the trial court even as the judgment had
become final as it is his duty to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">see
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to it that the judgment is fully
satisfied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED with costs against
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order issued
by this Court on <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1988</st1:date>
