				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a murder case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
about five o'clock in the afternoon of March 22, 1973 <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Tarpin</span>, <span style="">Romeo </span><span class="SpellE">Cagara</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Poleño</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Argales</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Genita</span> had a conference at the volleyball court of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, La Paz, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They agreed <span style="">to get hold of the firearm of <span class="SpellE">Lolito</span> Bernal,
a resident of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Calab­nian</span>, La Paz, and to kill
him if he refused to surrender it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To implement that agreement, the conspirators, all armed,
proceeded to Bernal's house which was about half a kilometer away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way, they met <span class="SpellE">Eutropio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Argales</span> and convinced him to join them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reached <span class="SpellE">Lolito's</span>
house at about seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p class="BODY">In accordance with the plan, <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarpin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Poleño</span> pushed the door
and barged inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> stationed him­self in the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Genita</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Argales</span> cousins posted themselves as lookouts in the yard.</p>

<p class="BODY">Angeles Bernal, 29, testified that her husband <span class="SpellE">Lolito</span>, 29, was slicing meat in the kitchen when the three
intruders suddenly entered <span style="">the house
and proceeded directly to the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had known <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Poleño</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
when the male­factors came in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> ordered <span class="SpellE">Lolito</span>
to put down his bolo and surrender <span class="GramE">his<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firearm</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lolito</span> said that he
had no firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Enraged
by that answer, <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarpin</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Poleño</span> took turns in hacking <span class="SpellE">Lolito</span>
with their bolos.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> came in and with his bolo also assaulted <span class="SpellE">Lolito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fell on
the floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Angeles shouted for help.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To muffle her outcry, <span class="SpellE">Poleño</span> pressed her head
against the floor and fired at her two times with his revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She <span class="GramE">was</span> not
hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullets hit the nylon sack
dividing the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Be­lieving that <span class="SpellE">Lolito</span> was already dead, the
four assailants left the house and fled to the mountain of <span class="SpellE">Hinonocan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lolito</span> Bernal sustained an incised
wound in the neck, two inches wide and six inches deep, which reached the
cervical bone and cut the big blood vessels in the neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a fatal wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also fatal was an incised wound in the chest
which lacerated the liver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernal was
also wounded on the face, shoulders, vertebral column and hands (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He</span> died in his house as a result of those wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tarpin</span> was killed in an encounter with
the Constabulary soldiers on March 30, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The next day <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Poleño</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> were <span style="">captured
by a posse of Constabulary soldiers and policemen who-raided their mountain
hideout in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seized from them were homemade .38 caliber
pistols, a .22 caliber pistol, a rifle, four shotguns and assorted rounds of
ammunition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Poleño</span> <span class="SpellE">Eutropio</span> <span class="SpellE">Argales</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Argales</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Genita</span> were charged
with murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Genita</span>
was not arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Argales</span> cousins were discharged and became State witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City Branch IV,
Convicted <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Poleño</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> of murder, sentenced each of them to death
and ordered them to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> to Bernal's heirs
an indemnity of twelve thousand pesos (Criminal Case No. 1168, Decision of
August 13 as amended on August 18, 1975).</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is now before this Court for mandatory review of the
death sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case was tried
jointly with <u>Criminal Case No. 1167</u> wherein the lower court in a
separate decision convicted <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> of <span class="GramE">murder,</span> sentenced each
of them to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and
ordered them to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> the heirs of <u>Jesus
Canales</u> an indemnity <span style="">of twelve
thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found
that <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span>
killed Canales on March 19, 1973 or three days before they killed Bernal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Because <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> <u>did not appeal</u> from the decision in Criminal
Case No. 1167, now L-41493, we cannot review the sentence of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> in that case which became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> after fifteen days from the promulgation of the
decision on August 11, 1975.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Criminal Case No. 1168,</u> now L-41494, <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Poleño</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cagara</span> interposed an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They claimed that from March 15 to 30, 1973, they were in the abaca farm
of <span class="SpellE">Tarpin</span> in the mountain of <span class="SpellE">Hinonocan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court correctly disbelieved that
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a fabricated defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three accused executed extrajudicial confessions wherein they
admitted that they killed Bernal (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">D, E, Q or 6 and R or 3).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the trial, they repudiated their confessions and declared that they
were maltreated by the Constabulary soldiers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> stated in his confession that Bernal
was killed because he was <span class="SpellE">Tarpin's</span> enemy (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">R or 3).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">They contend that their confessions are not admissible under
section 20, Article IV of the Constitution because they were not informed of
their rights to remain silent and to have counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the only issue raised in this review
of their death sentences.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constabulary investigator and the fiscal before whom the
confessions were sworn testified that the confessions were voluntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
investigator denied that there was any maltreatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal said that he read the confessions
to the accused and required them to sign the confessions again in his presence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is stated in the confessions that the confessants were <span class="GramE">apprised</span> of their constitutional rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigator testified that he advised
the three accused of their rights to remain silent and to be assisted by
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly informed them that
any statement made by them would be used against them in court (40 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1975</st1:date>;
269-270 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="5">May
 27, 1975</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified that he conducted the interrogation in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Waray-Waray</u></span><i> </i>dialect, which is known to the
accused, and translated into English the questions and the answers thereto and
that after the investigation and before they signed their confessions, he read
the contents thereof to them in the dialect (42- 46 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>
April 29, 1975).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
admitted the confessions over the objection of defense counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2nd 694
("an earthquake in the world of law enforcement") lays down the
follow­ing procedural safeguards contemplated in section 20 of our Bill of
Rights:</p>

<p class="BODY">"He (the accused) must be warned prior to any questioning
that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used
against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of <span style="">an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an
attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so
desires.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to
him throughout the interrogation.</p>

<p class="BODY">"After such warnings have been given, and such opportunity
afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights
and agree to answer questions or make a statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">"But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demons­tr<span style="">a</span>ted by the prosecution at trial, no evidence
obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him." (p. 726.
See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, G. R. No. 52016, May 13, 1981).</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that even if the extrajudicial confessions, which were
taken during custodial interrogation when the accused were not assisted <span style="">by counsel, are inadmissible, the trial court
did not err in convicting them of murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Their culpability was proven beyond reasonable doubt by the
testimonies of the eyewitness, Angeles Bernal, and the two accused who became
State witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The murder was qualified by abuse of superiority (absorbing band)
and aggravated by evident premeditation and dwelling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No miti­gating circumstances can be
appreciated in favor of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy was proven by means of the testimonies of the two
State witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein three
accused have been shown to be lawless malefactors who had no compunction in
killing a man just to satisfy the vindictive whim of <span class="SpellE">Tarpin</span>
and in order to divest him of his firearm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For such a senseless assassination committed by useless and dangerous
members of society, the death penalty is a just and appropriate punishment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the trial court's amended decision is
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
