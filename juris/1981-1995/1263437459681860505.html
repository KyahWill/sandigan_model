				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Herein accused-appellant Martin Simon y Sunga was charged on November
10, 1988 with a violation of Section 4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425, as
amended, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, under an
indictment alleging that on or about October 22, 1988, at Barangay Sto. Cristo,
Guagua, Pampanga, he sold four tea bags of marijuana to a Narcotics Command
(NARCOM) poseur-buyer in consideration of the sum of P40.00, which tea bags,
when subjected to laboratory examination, were found positive for marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Eventually arraigned with the assistance of counsel on March 2,
1989, after his rearrest following his escape from Camp Olivas, San Fernando,
Pampanga where he was temporarily detained,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
he pleaded not guilty.  He voluntarily
waived his right to a pre-trial conference,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
after which trial on the merits ensued and was duly concluded.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record shows that a confidential informant, later
identified as a NARCOM operative, informed the police unit at Camp Olivas, San
Fernando, Pampanga, of the illegal drug activities of a certain <i>"Alyas
Pusa"</i> at Sto. Cristo, Guagua, Pampanga.  Capt. Francisco Bustamante, Commanding Officer of the 3rd
Narcotics Regional Unit in the camp, then formed a buy-bust team composed of
Sgt. Buenaventura Lopez, Pfc. Virgilio Villaruz and Sgt. Domingo Pejoro, all
members of the same unit.  After
securing marked money from Bustamante, the team, together with their informant,
proceeded to Sto. Cristo after they had coordinated with the police authorities
and <i>barangay</i> officers thereof.  When they reached the place, the confidential informer pointed out
appellant to Lopez who consequently approached appellant and asked him if he
had marijuana.  Appellant answered in
the affirmative and Lopez offered to buy two tea bags.  Appellant then left and, upon returning
shortly thereafter, handed to Lopez two marijuana tea bags and Lopez gave him
the marked money amounting to P40.00 as payment.  Lopez then scratched his head as a pre-arranged signal to his
companions who were stationed around ten to fifteen meters away, and the team
closed in on them.  Thereupon, Villaruz,
who was the head of the back-up team, arrested appellant.  The latter was then brought by the team to
the 3rd Narcotics Regional Unit at Camp Olivas on board a jeep and he was
placed under custodial investigation, with Sgt. Pejoro as the investigator.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. Villaruz corroborated Lopez' testimony, claiming that he saw
the deal that transpired between Lopez and the appellant.  He also averred that he was the one who
confiscated the marijuana and took the marked money from appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. Domingo Pejoro, for his part, declared that although he was
part of the buy-bust team, he was stationed farthest from the rest of the other
members, that is, around two hundred meters away from his companions.  He did not actually see the sale that
transpired between Lopez and appellant but he saw his teammates accosting
appellant after the latter's arrest.  He
was likewise the one who conducted the custodial investigation of appellant
wherein the latter was apprised of his rights to remain silent, to information
and to counsel.  Appellant, however,
orally waived his right to counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pejoro also claimed having prepared Exhibit "G," the
"Receipt of Property Seized/Confiscated" which appellant signed,
admitting therein the confiscation of four tea bags of marijuana dried leaves
in his possession.  Pejoro likewise
informed the court below that, originally, what he placed on the receipt was
that only one marijuana leaf was confiscated in exchange for P20.00.  However, Lopez and Villaruz corrected his
entry by telling him to put "two," instead of "one" and
"40," instead of "20".  He agreed to the correction since they were the ones who were personally
and directly involved in the purchase of the marijuana and the arrest of
appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Pedro S. Calara, a medical officer at Camp Olivas, examined
appellant at 5:30 P.M. of the day after the latter's apprehension, and the
results were practically normal except for his relatively high blood
pressure.  The doctor also did not find
any trace of physical injury on the person of appellant.  The next day, he again examined appellant
due to the latter's complaint of gastro-intestinal pain.  In the course of the examination, Dr. Calara
discovered that appellant has a history of peptic ulcer, which causes him to
experience abdominal pain and consequently vomit blood.  In the afternoon, appellant came back with
the same complaint but, except for the gastro-intestinal pain, his physical
condition remained normal.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As expected, appellant tendered an antipodal version of the
attendant facts, claiming that on the day in question, at around 4:30 P.M., he
was watching television with the members of his family in their house when
three persons, whom he had never met before suddenly arrived.  Relying on the assurance that they would
just inquire about something from him at their detachment, appellant boarded a
jeep with them.  He was told that they
were going to Camp Olivas, but he later noticed that they were taking a
different route.  While on board, he was
told that he was a pusher so he attempted to alight from the jeep but he was
handcuffed instead.  When they finally
reached the camp, he was ordered to sign some papers and, when he refused, he
was boxed in the stomach eight or nine times by Sgt. Pejoro.  He was then compelled to affix his signature
and fingerprints on the documents presented to him.  He denied knowledge of the P20.00 or the dried marijuana leaves,
and insisted that the twenty-peso bill came from the pocket of Pejoro.  Moreover, the reason why he vomited blood
was because of the blows he suffered at the hands of Pejoro.  He admitted having escaped from the NARCOM
office but claimed that he did so since he could no longer endure the
maltreatment to which he was being subjected.  After escaping, he proceeded to the house of his uncle, Bienvenido
Sunga, at San Matias, Guagua, reaching the place at around 6:30 or 7:30
P.M.  There, he consulted a quack doctor
and, later, he was accompanied by his sister to the Romana Pangan District
Hospital at Floridablanca, Pampanga where he was confined for three days.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's brother, Norberto Simon, testified to the fact that
appellant was hospitalized at Floridablanca, Pampanga after undergoing
abdominal pain and vomiting of blood.  He likewise confirmed that appellant had been suffering from peptic
ulcer even before the latter's arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Also, Dr. Evelyn Gomez-Aguas, a resident physician of Romana Pangan District
Hospital, declared that she treated appellant for three days due to abdominal
pain, but her examination revealed that the cause for this ailment was
appellant's peptic ulcer.  She did not
see any sign of slight or serious external injury, abrasion or contusion on his
body.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 4, 1989, after weighing the evidence presented, the
trial court rendered judgment convicting appellant for a violation of Section
4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, and sentencing him to
suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, to pay a fine of twenty thousand pesos
and to pay the costs.  The four tea bags
of marijuana dried leaves were likewise ordered confiscated in favor of the
Government.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant now prays the Court to reverse the aforementioned
judgment of the lower court, contending in his assignment of errors that the
latter erred in (1) not upholding his defense of "frame-up," (2) not
declaring Exhibit "G" (Receipt of Property Seized/Confiscated)
inadmissible in evidence, and (3) convicting him of a violation of the
Dangerous Drugs Act.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it should be noted that while the People's real
theory and evidence is to the effect that appellant actually sold only two tea
bags of marijuana dried leaves, while the other two tea bags were merely
confiscated subsequently from his possession,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
the latter not being in any way connected with the sale, the information
alleges that he sold and delivered four tea bags of marijuana dried leaves.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In view thereof, the issue presented for resolution in this appeal is merely
the <i>act of selling the two tea bags</i> allegedly committed by appellant,
and does not include the disparate and distinct issue of <i>illegal possession
of the other two tea bags</i> which separate offense is not charged herein.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To sustain a conviction for selling prohibited drugs, the sale
must be clearly and unmistakably established.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
To sell means to give, whether for money or any other material consideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
It must, therefore, be established beyond doubt that appellant actually sold
and delivered two tea bags of marijuana dried leaves to Sgt. Lopez, who acted
as the poseur-buyer, in exchange for two twenty-peso bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">After an assiduous review and calibration of the evidence adduced
by both parties, we are morally certain that appellant was caught in <i>flagrante
delicto</i> engaging in the illegal sale of prohibited drugs.  The prosecution was able to prove beyond a
scintilla of doubt that appellant, on October 22, 1988, did sell two tea bags
of marijuana dried leaves to Sgt. Lopez.  The latter himself creditably testified as to how the sale took place
and his testimony was amply corroborated by his teammates.  As between the straightforward, positive and
corroborated testimony of Lopez and the bare denials and negative testimony of
appellant, the former undeniably deserves greater weight and is more entitled to
credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are aware that the practice of entrapping drug traffickers
through the utilization of poseur-buyers is susceptible to mistake, harassment,
extortion and abuse.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, such causes for judicial apprehension and doubt do not obtain in
the case at bar.  Appellant's entrapment
and arrest were not effected in a haphazard way, for a surveillance was
conducted by the team before the buy-bust operation was effected.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
No ill motive was or could be attributed to them, aside from the fact that they
are presumed to have regularly performed their official duty.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Such lack of dubious motive coupled with the presumption of regularity in the
performance of official duty, as well, as the findings of the trial court on
the credibility of witnesses, should prevail over the self-serving and uncorroborated
claim of appellant of having been framed,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
erected as it is upon the mere shifting sands of an alibi.  To top it all, appellant was caught
red-handed delivering prohibited drugs, and while there was a delimited chance
for him to controvert the charge, he does not appear to have plausibly done so.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the drug seized was submitted to the Crime Laboratory
Service of the then Philippine Constabulary-Integrated National Police (PC-INP)
at Camp Olivas for examination, P/Cpl. Marlyn Salangad, a forensic chemist
therein,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
confirmed in her Technical Report No. NB-448-88 that the contents of the four
tea bags confiscated from appellant were positive for and had a total weight of
3.8 grams of marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the <i>corpus delicti</i> of the crime had been fully proved with
certainty and conclusiveness.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would want to make capital of the alleged
inconsistencies and improbabilities in the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses.  Foremost, according to him,
is the matter of who really confiscated the marijuana tea bags from him since,
in open court, Pejoro asserted that he had nothing to do with the confiscation
of the marijuana, but in the aforementioned "Receipt of Property
Seized/Confiscated," he signed it as the one who seized the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to say that whether it was Villaruz or Pejoro who
confiscated the marijuana will not really matter since such is not an element
of the offense with which appellant is charged.  What is unmistakably clear is that the marijuana was confiscated
from the possession of appellant.  Even,
assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the prosecution committed an error on who
actually seized the marijuana from appellant, such an error or discrepancy
refers only to a minor matter and, as such, neither impairs the essential
integrity of the prosecution evidence as a whole nor reflects on the witnesses'
honesty.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, there was clearly a mere imprecision of language since Pejoro
obviously meant that he did not take part in the <i>physical</i> taking of the
drug from the person of appellant, but he participated in the <i>legal</i>
seizure or confiscation thereof as the investigator of their unit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Next, appellant adduces the argument that the twenty-peso bills
allegedly confiscated from him were not powdered for finger-printing purposes
contrary to the normal procedure in buy-bust operations.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
This omission has been satisfactorily explained by Pfc. Virgilio Villaruz in
his testimony, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:  Is it the standard operating procedure of your unit that in
conducting such operation you do not anymore provide a powder (sic) on the
object so as to determine the thumbmark or identity of the persons taking hold
of the object?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:  We were not able to put powder on these denominations because we are
lacking that kind of material in our office since that item can be purchased
only in Manila and only few are producing that, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
it not a fact that your office is within (the) P.C. Crime Laboratory, CIS, as
well as the office of NICA?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:  Our office is only adjacent to those offices but we cannot make a
request for that powder because they, themselves, are using that in their own
work, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing explanation aside, we agree that the failure to
mark the money bills used for entrapment purposes can under no mode of
rationalization be fatal to the case of the prosecution because the Dangerous
Drugs Act punishes "any person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell,
administer, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or
transport any prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of such
transactions."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
The dusting of said bills with phosphorescent powder is only an evidentiary
technique for identification purposes, which identification can be supplied by
other species of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, appellant contends that there was neither a relative of
his nor any <i>barangay</i> official or civilian to witness the seizure.  He decries the lack of pictures taken
before, during and after his arrest.  Moreover, he was not reported to or booked in the custody of any <i>barangay</i>
official or police authorities.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
These are absurd disputations.  No law
or jurisprudence requires that an arrest or seizure, to be valid, be witnessed
by a relative, a <i>barangay</i> official or any other civilian, or be
accompanied by the taking of pictures.  On the contrary, the police enforcers having caught appellant in <i>flagrante
delicto</i>, they were not only authorized but were also under the obligation
to effect a warrantless arrest and seizure.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, contrary to appellant's contention, there was an arrest
report prepared by the police in connection with his apprehension.  Said Booking Sheet and Arrest Report<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
states, <i>inter alia</i>, that "suspect was arrested for selling two tea
bags of suspected marijuana dried leaves and the confiscation of another two
tea bags of suspected marijuana dried leaves." Below these remarks was
affixed appellant's signature.  In the
same manner, the receipt for the seized property, hereinbefore mentioned, was
signed by appellant wherein he acknowledged the confiscation of the marked
bills from him.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, we find and hereby declare the aforementioned exhibits
inadmissible in evidence.  Appellant's
conformance to these documents are declarations against interest and tacit
admissions of the crime charged.  They
were obtained in violation of his right as a person under custodial
investigation for the commission of an offense, there being nothing in the
records to show that he was assisted by counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Although appellant manifested during the custodial investigation that he waived
his right to counsel, the waiver was not made in writing and in the presence of
counsel,<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
hence whatever incriminatory admission or confession may be extracted from him,
either verbally or in writing, is not allowable in evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the arrest report is self-serving and hearsay and can easily be
concocted to implicate a suspect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the objectionability of the aforesaid exhibits,
appellant cannot thereby be extricated from his predicament since his criminal
participation in the illegal sale of marijuana has been sufficiently
proven.  The commission of the offense
of illegal sale of prohibited drugs requires merely the consummation of the
selling transaction<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
which happens the moment the buyer receives the drug from the seller.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, and in light of the preceding discussion, this sale has
been ascertained beyond any peradventure of doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant then asseverates that it is improbable that he would
sell marijuana to a total stranger.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
We take this opportunity to once again reiterate the doctrinal rule that
drug-pushing, when done on a small scale as in this case, belongs to that class
of crimes that may be committed at any time and in any place.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not contrary to human experience for a drug pusher to sell to a total
stranger,<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
for what matters is not an existing familiarity between the buyer and seller
but their agreement and the acts constituting the sale and delivery of the
marijuana leaves.<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
While there may be instances where such sale could be improbable, taking into
consideration the diverse circumstances of person, time and place, as well as
the incredibility of how the accused supposedly acted on that occasion, we can
safely say that those exceptional particulars are not present in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant contends that he was subjected to physical and
mental torture by the arresting officers which caused him to escape from Camp
Olivas the night he was placed under custody.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
This he asserts to support his explanation as to how his signatures on the
documents earlier discussed were supposedly obtained by force and coercion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine is now too well embedded in our jurisprudence that
for evidence to be believed, it must not only proceed from the mouth of a
credible witness but must be credible in itself such as the common experience
and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
The evidence on record is bereft of any support for appellant's allegation of
maltreatment.  Two doctors, one for the
prosecution<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
and the other for the defense,<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
testified on the absence of any tell-tale sign or indication of bodily injury,
abrasions or contusions on the person of appellant.  What is evident is that the cause of his abdominal pain was his
peptic ulcer from which he had been suffering even before his arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
His own brother even corroborated that fact, saying that appellant has had a
history of bleeding peptic ulcer.<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, if it is true that appellant was maltreated at Camp
Olivas, he had no reason whatsoever for not divulging the same to his brother
who went to see him at the camp after his arrest and during his detention
there.<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
Significantly, he also did not even report the matter to the authorities nor file
appropriate charges against the alleged malefactors despite the opportunity to
do so<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
and with the legal services of counsel being available to him.  Such omissions funnel down to the conclusion
that appellant's story is a pure fabrication.</p>

<p class="BODY">These, and the events earlier discussed, soundly refute his
allegations that his arrest was baseless and premeditated for the NARCOM agents
were determined to arrest him at all costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
Premeditated or not, appellant's arrest was only the culmination, the final act
needed for his isolation from society and it was providential that it came
about after he was caught in the very act of illicit trade of prohibited
drugs.  Accordingly, this opinion could
have concluded on a note of affirmance of the judgment of the trial court.  However, Republic Act No. 6425, as amended,
was further amended by Republic Act No. 7659 effective December 31, 1993,<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>
which supervenience necessarily affects the original disposition of this case
and entails additional questions of law which we shall now resolve.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">The provisions of the aforesaid amendatory law, pertinent to the
adjudication of the case at bar, are to this effect:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13.  Sections 3,
4, 5, 7, 8 and 9 of Art. II of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, known as the
Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, are hereby amended to read as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘SEC. 4.  <i>Sale,

sell, administer, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in
transit or transport any prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of
such transactions.'</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 17.  Section 20,
Article IV of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, known as the Dangerous Drugs
Act of 1972, is hereby amended to read as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Sec. 20.  <i>Application of

under Sections 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Article II and Sections 14, 14-A, 15 and 16

in any of the following quantities:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 103.5pt; text-indent: -17.1pt;">5.  750 grams or more of indian hemp or
marijuana</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Otherwise, if the quantity involved is less than the foregoing
quantities, the penalty shall range from <i>prision</i> <i>correccional </i>to <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> depending upon the quantity.' "</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Considering that herein appellant is being prosecuted for the
sale of four tea bags of marijuana with a total weight of only 3.8 grams and,
in fact, stands to be convicted for the sale of only two of those tea bags, the
initial inquiry would be whether the patently favorable provisions of Republic
Act No. 7659 should be given retroactive effect to entitle him to the lesser
penalty provided thereunder, pursuant to Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although Republic Act No. 6425 was enacted as a special law,
albeit originally amendatory and in substitution of the previous Articles 190
to 194 of the Revised Penal Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
it has long been settled that by force of Article 10 of said Code the
beneficent provisions of Article 22 thereof applies to and shall be given
retrospective effect to crimes punished by special laws.<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
The exception in said article would not apply to those convicted of drug
offenses since habitual delinquency refers to convictions for the third time or
more of the crimes of serious or less serious physical injuries, <i>robo,
hurto, estafa</i> or falsification.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since, obviously, the favorable provisions of Republic Act No.
7659 could neither have then been involved nor invoked in the present case, a
corollary question would be whether this court, at the present stage, can <i>sua</i>
<i>sponte </i>apply the provisions of said Article 22 to reduce the penalty to
be imposed on appellant.  That issue has
likewise been resolved in the cited case of <i>People vs. Moran, et al</i>.<i>,
ante</i>., thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  The plain precept contained in article 22 of the Penal Code,
declaring the retroactivity of penal laws in so far as they are favorable to
persons accused of a felony, would be useless and nugatory if the courts of
justice were not under obligation to fulfill such duty, irrespective of whether
or not the accused has applied for it, just as would also all provisions
relating to the prescription of the crime and the penalty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If the judgment which could be affected and modified by the
reduced penalties provided in Republic Act No. 7659 has already become final
and executory or the accused is serving sentence thereunder, then practice,
procedure and pragmatic considerations would warrant and necessitate the matter
being brought to the judicial authorities for relief under a writ of <i>habeas
corpus</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Probably through oversight, an error on the matter of imposable
penalties appears to have been committed in the drafting of the aforesaid law,
thereby calling for and necessitating judicial reconciliation and
craftsmanship.</p>

<p class="BODY">As applied to the present case, Section 4 of Republic Act No.
6425, as now further amended, imposes the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>
to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00 upon any person
who shall unlawfully sell, administer, deliver, give away, distribute, dispatch
in transit or transport any prohibited drug.  That penalty, according to the amendment to Section 20 of the law, shall
be applied if what is involved is 750 grams or more of indian hemp or marijuana;
otherwise, if the quantity involved is less, the penalty shall range from <i>prision
correccional</i> to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>depending upon the quantity.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, there is here an overlapping error in the
provisions on the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> by reason of its dual
imposition, that is, as the maximum of the penalty where the marijuana is less
than 750 grams, and also as the minimum of the penalty where the marijuana
involved is 750 grams or more.  The same
error has been committed with respect to the other prohibited and regulated
drugs provided in said Section 20.  To
harmonize such conflicting provisions in order to give effect to the whole law,<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
we hereby hold that the penalty to be imposed where the quantity of the drugs
involved is less than the quantities stated in the first paragraph shall range
from <i>prision correccional</i> to <i>reclusion temporal</i>, and not <i>reclusion
perpetua</i>.  This is also concordant
with the fundamental rule in criminal law that all doubts should be construed
in a manner favorable to the accused.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Where, as in this case, the quantity of the dangerous drug is
only 3.8 grams, hence covered by the imposable range of penalties under the
second paragraph of Section 20, as now modified, the law provides that the
penalty shall be taken from said range "<i>depending upon the quantity</i>"
of the drug involved in the case.  The
penalty in said second paragraph constitutes a complex one composed of three
distinct penalties, that is, <i>prision correccional</i>, <i>prision mayor</i>,
and <i>reclusion temporal</i>.  In such a
situation, the Code provides that each one shall form a period, with the
lightest of them being the minimum, the next as the medium, and the most severe
as the maximum period.<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, and pursuant to Article 64 of the Code, the
mitigating and aggravating circumstances determine which period of such complex
penalty shall be imposed on the accused.  The peculiarity of the <i>second paragraph of Section 20</i>, however,
is its specific mandate, above quoted, that the penalty shall instead <i>depend
upon the quantity</i> of the drug subject of the criminal transaction.<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, by way of exception to Article 77 of the Code and to subserve the
purpose of Section 20 of Republic Act No. 7659, each of the aforesaid component
penalties shall be considered as a principal imposable penalty depending on the
quantity of the drug involved.  Thereby,
the modifying circumstances will not altogether be disregarded.  Since each component penalty of the total
complex penalty will have to be imposed separately as determined by the
quantity of the drug involved, then the modifying circumstances can be used to
fix the proper period of that component penalty, as shall hereafter be
explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would, therefore, be in line with the provisions of Section 20
in the context of our aforesaid disposition thereon that, unless there are
compelling reasons for a deviation, the quantities of the drugs enumerated in
its second paragraph be divided into three, with the resulting quotient, and
double or treble the same, to be respectively the bases for allocating the
penalty proportionately among the three aforesaid periods according to the
severity thereof.  Thus, if the
marijuana involved is below 250 grams, the penalty to be imposed shall be <i>prision
correccional</i>; from 250 to 499 grams, <i>prision mayor</i>; and 500 to 749
grams, <i>reclusion temporal</i>.  Parenthetically, fine is imposed as a conjunctive penalty only if the
penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, considering the minimal quantity of the marijuana subject of
the case at bar, the penalty of <i>prision correccional</i> is consequently
indicated but, again, another preliminary and cognate issue has first to be
resolved.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.  <i>Prision correccional</i>
has a duration of 6 months and 1 day to 6 years and, as a divisible penalty, it
consists of three periods as provided in the text of and illustrated in the
table provided by Article 76 of the Code.  The question is whether or not in determining the penalty to be imposed,
which is here to be taken from the penalty of <i>prision correccional</i>, the
presence or absence of mitigating, aggravating or other circumstances modifying
criminal liability should be taken into account.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not unaware of cases in the past wherein it was held that,
in imposing the penalty for offenses under special laws, the rules on mitigating
or aggravating circumstances under the Revised Penal Code cannot and should not
be applied.  A review of such doctrines
as applied in said cases, however, reveals that the reason therefor was because
the special laws involved provided their own specific penalties for the
offenses punished thereunder, and which penalties were not taken from or with
reference to those in the Revised Penal Code.  Since the penalties then provided by the special laws concerned did not provide
for the minimum, medium or maximum periods, it would consequently be impossible
to consider the aforestated modifying circumstances whose main function is to
determine the period of the penalty in accordance with the rules in Article 64
of the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is also the rationale for the holding in previous cases that
the provisions of the Code on the graduation of penalties by degrees could not
be given supplementary application to special laws, since the penalties in the
latter were not components of or contemplated in the scale of penalties
provided by Article 71 of the former.  The suppletory effect of the Revised Penal Code to special laws, as
provided in Article 10 of the former, cannot be invoked where there is a legal
or physical impossibility of, or a prohibition in the special law against, such
supplementary application.</p>

<p class="BODY">The situation, however, is different where although the offense
is defined in and ostensibly punished under a special law, the penalty therefor
is actually taken from the Revised Penal Code in its technical nomenclature
and, necessarily, with its duration, correlation and legal effects under the
system of penalties native to said Code.  When, as in this case, the law involved speaks of<i> prision
correccional</i>, in its technical sense under the Code, it would consequently
be both illogical and absurd to posit otherwise.  More on this later.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the nonce, we hold that in the instant case the imposable
penalty under Republic Act No. 6425, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, is <i>prision
correccional</i>, to be taken from the medium period thereof pursuant to
Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code, there being no attendant mitigating or
aggravating circumstance.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. At this juncture, a clarificatory discussion of the
developmental changes in the penalties imposed for offenses under special laws
would be necessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Originally, those special laws, just as was the conventional
practice in the United States but differently from the penalties provided in
our Revised Penal Code and its Spanish origins, provided for one specific
penalty or a range of penalties with definitive durations, such as imprisonment
for one year or for one to five years but without division into periods or any
technical statutory cognomen.  This is
the special law contemplated in and referred to at the time laws like the
Indeterminate Sentence Law<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>
were passed during the American regime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, a different pattern emerged whereby a special law
would direct that an offense thereunder shall be punished under the Revised
Penal Code and in the same manner provided therein.  Inceptively, for instance, Commonwealth Act No. 303<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a>
penalizing non-payment of salaries and wages with the periodicity prescribed
therein, provided:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4.  Failure of
the employer to pay his employee or laborer as required by section one of this
Act, shall <i>prima facie</i> be considered a fraud committed by such employer
against his employee or laborer by means of false pretenses similar to those
mentioned in article three hundred and fifteen, paragraph four, sub-paragraph
two (a) of the Revised Penal Code and <i>shall be punished in the same manner
as therein provided</i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, special laws were enacted where the offenses defined
therein were specifically punished by the penalties as technically named and
understood in the Revised Penal Code.  These are exemplified by Republic Act No. 1700 (Anti-Subversion Act)
where the penalties ranged from <i>arresto mayor</i> to death;<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></span></span></a>
Presidential Decree No. 1612 (Anti-Fencing Decree) where the penalties run from
<i>arresto mayor </i>to<i> prision mayor;</i> and Presidential Decree No. 1866
(illegal possession and other prohibited acts involving firearms), the
penalties wherefor may involve <i>prision mayor</i>, <i>reclusion temporal</i>,
<i>reclusion perpetua</i> or death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another variant worth mentioning is Republic Act No. 6539
(Anti-Carnapping Act of 1972) where the penalty is imprisonment for not less
than 14 years and 8 months and not more than 17 years and 4 months, when
committed without violence or intimidation of persons or force upon things; not
less than 17 years and 4 months and not more than 30 years, when committed with
violence against or intimidation of any person, or force upon things; and life
imprisonment to death, when the owner, driver or occupant of the carnapped
vehicle is killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first example, where the penalties under the
special law are different from and are without reference or relation to those
under the Revised Penal Code, there can be no suppletory effect of the rules
for the application of penalties under said Code or by other relevant statutory
provisions based on or applicable only to said rules for felonies under the
Code.  In this type of special law, the
legislative intendment is clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same exclusionary rule would apply to the last given example,
Republic Act No. 6539.  While it is true
that the penalty of 14 years and 8 months to 17 years and 4 months is virtually
equivalent to the duration of the medium period of <i>reclusion temporal</i>,
such technical term under the Revised Penal Code is not given to that penalty
for carnapping.  Besides, the other penalties
for carnapping attended by the qualifying circumstances stated in the law do
not correspond to those in the Code.  The rules on penalties in the Code, therefore, cannot suppletorily apply
to Republic Act No. 6539 and special laws of the same formulation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the rules for the application of penalties and
the correlative effects thereof under the Revised Penal Code, as well as other
statutory enactments founded upon and applicable to such provisions of the
Code, have suppletory effect to the penalties under the former Republic Act No.
1700 and those now provided under Presidential Decrees Nos. 1612 and 1866.  While these are special laws, the fact that
the penalties for offenses thereunder are those provided for in the Revised
Penal Code lucidly reveals the statutory intent to give the related provisions
on penalties for felonies under the Code the corresponding application to said
special laws, in the absence of any express or implicit proscription in these
special laws.  To hold otherwise would
be to sanction an indefensible judicial truncation of an integrated system of
penalties under the Code and its allied legislation, which could never have
been the intendment of Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>People vs. Macatanda</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a>
a prosecution under a special law (Presidential Decree No. 533, otherwise known
as the Anti-Cattle Rustling Law of 1974), it was contended by the prosecution
that Article 64, paragraph 5, of the Revised Penal Code should not apply to
said special law.  We said therein that
--</p>

<blockquote>"We do not agree with the Solicitor General that P.D. 533 is a
special law <i>entirely distinct from and unrelated to the Revised Penal Code.</i>  From the nature of the penalty imposed<i>
which is in terms of the classification and duration of penalties as prescribed
in the Revised Penal Code</i>, which is not for penalties as are ordinarily
imposed in special laws, the intent seems clear that P.D. 533 shall be deemed
as an amendment of the Revised Penal Code, with respect to the offense of theft
of large cattle (Art. 310) <i>or otherwise to be subject to applicable
provisions thereof</i> such as Article 104 of the Revised Penal Code x x
x.  Article 64 of the same Code should,
likewise, be applicable, x x x." (Italics supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">More particularly with regard to the suppletory effect of the
rules on penalties in the Revised Penal Code to Republic Act No. 6425, in this
case involving Article 63(2) of the Code, we have this more recent
pronouncement:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  Pointing out
that as provided in Article 10 the provisions of the Revised Penal Code shall
be 'supplementary' to special laws, this Court held that where the special law
expressly grants to the court discretion in applying the penalty prescribed for
the offense, there is no room for the application of the provisions of the
Code.  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended by P.D. No. 1623,
contains no explicit grant of discretion to the Court in the application of the
penalty prescribed by the law.  <i>In
such case, the court must be guided by the rules prescribed by the Revised
Penal Code concerning the application of penalties</i> which distill the 'deep
legal thought and centuries of experience in the administration of criminal
laws.'” (Emphasis ours.)<a style="" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the aforestated considerations, in the case of the
Dangerous Drugs Act as now amended by Republic Act No. 7659 by the
incorporation and prescription therein of the technical penalties defined in
and constituting integral parts of the three scales of penalties in the Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></span></span></a>
with much more reason should the provisions of said Code on the appreciation
and effects of all attendant modifying circumstances apply in fixing the
penalty.  Likewise, the different kinds
or classifications of penalties and the rules for graduating such penalties by
degrees should have supplementary effect on Republic Act No. 6425, except if
they would result in absurdities as will now be explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">While not squarely in issue in this case, but because this aspect
is involved in the discussion on the role of modifying circumstances, we have
perforce to lay down the <i>caveat</i> that mitigating circumstances should be
considered and applied only if they affect the <i>periods</i> and the <i>degrees</i>
of the penalties<i> within rational limits</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prefatorily, what ordinarily are involved in the graduation and
consequently determine the degree of the penalty, in accordance with the rules
in Article 61 of the Code as applied to the scale of penalties in Article 71,
are the stage of execution of the crime and the nature of the participation of
the accused.  However, under paragraph 5
of Article 64, when there are two or more ordinary mitigating circumstances and
no aggravating circumstance, the penalty shall be reduced by one <i>degree</i>.  Also, the presence of privileged mitigating
circumstances, as provided in Articles 67 and 68, can reduce the penalty by one
or two degrees, or even more.  These
provisions of Articles 64(5), 67 and 68 should not apply <i>in toto</i> in the
determination of the proper penalty under the aforestated second paragraph of
Section 20 of Republic Act No. 6425, to avoid anomalous results which could not
have been contemplated by the legislature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, paragraph 5 of Article 61 provides that when the law
prescribes a penalty in some manner not specially provided for in the four
preceding paragraphs thereof, the courts shall proceed by analogy
therewith.  Hence, when the penalty
prescribed for the crime consists of one or two penalties to be imposed in
their full extent, the penalty next lower in degree shall likewise consist of
as many penalties which follow the former in the scale in Article 71.  If this rule were to be applied, and since
the complex penalty in this case consists of three discrete penalties in their
full extent, that is, <i>prision correccional</i>, <i>prision mayor</i> and <i>reclusion
temporal</i>, then one degree lower would be <i>arresto menor, destierro </i>and<i>
arresto mayor</i>.  There could,
however, be no further reduction by still one or two degrees, which must each
likewise consist of three penalties, since only the penalties of fine and
public censure remain in the scale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court rules, therefore, that while modifying circumstances
may be appreciated to determine the <i>periods</i> of the corresponding
penalties, or even reduce the penalty by <i>degrees</i>, in no case should such
graduation of penalties reduce the imposable penalty beyond or lower than <i>prision
correccional</i>.  It is for this reason
that the three component penalties in the second paragraph of Section 20 shall
each be considered as an independent principal penalty, and that the lowest
penalty should in any event be <i>prision correccional </i>in order not to
depreciate the seriousness of drug offenses.  <i>Interpretatio fienda est ut res magis valeat quam pereat</i>.  Such interpretation is to be adopted so that
the law may continue to have efficacy rather than fail.  A perfect judicial solution cannot be forged
from an imperfect law, which impasse should now be the concern of and is
accordingly addressed to Congress.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. The final query is whether or not the Indeterminate Sentence
Law is applicable to the case now before us.  Apparently it does, since drug offenses are not included in nor has
appellant committed any act which would put him within the exceptions to said
law and the penalty to be imposed does not involve <i>reclusion perpetua</i> or
death, provided, of course, that the penalty as ultimately resolved will exceed
one year of imprisonment.<a style="" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></span></span></a>
The more important aspect, however, is how the indeterminate sentence shall be
ascertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Section 1 of said law, after providing for
indeterminate sentence for an offense under the Revised Penal Code, states that
"if the offense is punished by any other law, the court shall sentence the
accused to an indeterminate sentence, the maximum term of which shall not
exceed the maximum fixed by said law and the minimum shall not be less than the
minimum term prescribed by the same." We hold that this quoted portion of
the section indubitably refers to an offense under a special law wherein the
penalty imposed was not taken from and is without reference to the Revised
Penal Code, as discussed in the preceding illustrations, such that it may be
said that the "offense is punished" under that law.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no sensible debate that the aforequoted rule on
indeterminate sentence for offenses under special laws was necessary because of
the nature of the former type of penalties under said laws which were not
included or contemplated in the scale of penalties in Article 71 of the Code,
hence there could be no minimum "within the range of the penalty next
lower to that prescribed by the Code for the offense," as is the rule for
felonies therein.  In the illustrative
examples of penalties in special laws hereinbefore provided, this rule applied,
and would still apply, only to the first and last examples.  Furthermore, considering the vintage of Act
No. 4103 as earlier noted, this holding is but an application and is justified
under the rule of <i>contemporanea expositio</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We repeat, Republic Act No. 6425, as now amended by Republic Act
No. 7659, has unqualifiedly adopted the penalties under the Revised Penal Code
in their technical terms, hence with their technical signification and
effects.  In fact, for purposes of
determining the <i>maximum</i> of said sentence, we have applied the provisions
of the amended Section 20 of said law to arrive at <i>prision correccional</i>
and Article 64 of the Code to impose the same in the medium period.  Such offense, although provided for in a
special law, is now in effect <i>punished by and under the Revised Penal Code</i>.  Correlatively, to determine the minimum, we
must apply the first part of the aforesaid Section 1 which directs that
"in imposing a prison sentence for an offense punished by the Revised
Penal Code, or its amendments, the court shall sentence the accused to an
indeterminate sentence the <i>maximum</i> term of which shall be that which, in
view of the attending circumstances, could be properly imposed <i>under the
rules of said Code,</i> and the <i>minimum</i> which shall be within the range
of the <i>penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Code </i>for the
offense." (Italics ours.)</p>

<p class="BODY">A divergent pedantic application would not only be out of context
but also an admission of the hornbook maxim that <i>qui haeret in litera haeret
in cortice</i>.  Fortunately, this Court
has never gone only skin-deep in its construction of Act No. 4103 by a mere
literal appreciation of its provisions.  Thus, with regard to the phrase in Section 2 thereof excepting from its
coverage "persons convicted of offenses <i>punished</i> with death penalty
or <i>life imprisonment</i>," we have held that what is considered is the
penalty <i>actually imposed</i> and not the penalty imposable under the law,<a style="" href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></span></span></a>
and that <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is likewise embraced therein although what
the law states is "life imprisonment."</p>

<p class="BODY">What irresistibly emerges from the preceding disquisition,
therefore, is that under the concurrence of the principles of literal
interpretation, which have been rationalized by comparative decisions of this
Court; of historical interpretation, as explicated by the antecedents of the
law and related contemporaneous legislation; and of structural interpretation,
considering the interrelation of the penalties in the Code as supplemented by
Act No. 4103 in an integrated scheme of penalties, it follows that the minimum
of the indeterminate sentence in this case shall be the <i>penalty next lower</i>
to that prescribed for the offense.  Thereby we shall have interpreted the seeming ambiguity in Section 1 of
Act No. 4103 in such a way as to harmonize laws with laws, which is the best
mode of interpretation.<a style="" href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Indeterminate Sentence Law is a legal and social measure of
compassion, and should be liberally interpreted in favor of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></span></span></a>
The "minimum" sentence is merely a period at which, and not before,
as a matter of grace and not of right, the prisoner may merely be allowed to
serve the balance of his sentence outside of his confinement.<a style="" href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></span></span></a>
It does not constitute the totality of the penalty since thereafter he still
has to continue serving the rest of his sentence under set conditions.  That minimum is only the period when the
convict's eligibility for parole may be considered.  In fact, his release on parole may readily be denied if he is
found unworthy thereof, or his reincarceration may be ordered on legal grounds,
even if he has served the minimum sentence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus both amusing and bemusing if, in the case at bar,
appellant should be begrudged the benefit of a minimum sentence within the
range of <i>arresto mayor</i>, the penalty next lower to <i>prision correccional</i>
which is the maximum range we have fixed through the application of Articles 61
and 71 of the Revised Penal Code.  For,
with fealty to the law, the court may set the minimum sentence at 6 months of <i>arresto
mayor</i>, instead of 6 months and 1 day of <i>prision correccional</i>.  The difference, which could thereby even
involve only one day, is hardly worth the creation of an overrated tempest in
the judicial teapot.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, under all the foregoing premises, the
judgment of conviction rendered by the court <i>a quo</i> against
accused-appellant Martin Simon y Sunga is AFFIRMED, but with the MODIFICATION
that he should be, as he hereby is, sentenced to serve an indeterminate penalty
of six (6) months of <i>arresto mayor</i>, as the minimum, to six (6) years of <i>prision
correccional</i>, as the maximum thereof.</p>

SCRA 22.  In his sponsorship speech of Senate
Bill No. 891 as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Death Penalty, Senator
Arturo M. Tolentino made this enlightening explanation as reported in the
records of the Senate and which is pertinent to our present discussion:  "x x x Article 190, referring to
prohibited drugs, actually was repealed by the enactment of a special law
referring to drugs.  But since<i> we
were only amending the Revised Penal Code in this proposed bill or draft, we
reincorporated Article 190 in an amended form.  x x x It reincorporates and amends Article 190</i> on the importation,
manufacture, sale, administration upon another, or distribution of prohibited
drugs, planting or cultivation of any plant, which is a source of prohibited
drugs, maintenance of a den, dive or similar place, as defined in the Dangerous
Drugs Law" (9th CRP, 1st Regular Session, Vol. 1, No. 71, 12).</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-left: 0.5in; text-indent: -0.5in;">CONCURRING AND
DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I am still unable to
agree with the view that (a) in appropriate cases where the penalty to be
imposed would be </span><i>prision correccional</i> <span style="">pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 20 of R.A. No. 6425, as
amended by Section 17 of </span>R.A. No. <span style="">7659,
the sentence to be meted out, applying the Indeterminate Sentence </span><span style="">Law (Act No. 4103, as amended), </span>should
be that whose minimum is <span style="">within the
range of the penalty next lower,<i> i.e., </i></span><i>arresto mayor;</i> <span style="">and (b) the presence of two or more
mitigating circumstances not offset by any mitigating circumstances </span>or <span style="">of a privileged mitigating circumstance shall
not reduce the penalty by one or two degrees if the penalty to be imposed,
taking into account the quantity of the dangerous drugs involved, would be </span><i>prision
correccional</i>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The first view is based
on the proposition that since R.A. No. 7659 had unqualifiedly adopted the
penalties under the Revised Penal Code in their technical terms, hence also
their </span>technical <span style="">signification
and effects, then what should govern is the first part of Section 1 of the
Indeterminate Sentence Law which directs that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"in imposing a prison
sentence for an offense punished by the Revised Penal Code, or its amendments,
the court shall sentence the accused to an indeterminate sentence the maximum
term of which shall be that which, in view of the attending circumstances,
could be properly imposed under the rules of the said Code, and the minimum
which shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by
the Code for the offense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Elsewise stated, by the adoption of the penalties provided for in
the Revised Penal Code for the offenses penalized under the Dangerous Drugs Act
(R.A. No. 6425), as amended, the latter offenses would now be considered as
punished under the Revised Penal Code for purposes of the Indeterminate
Sentence Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law <span style="">(Act No. 4103, as amended by Act No. 4225 and
R.A. No. 4203) </span>also provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>if</u> <u>the</u>
<u>offense</u> <u>is</u> <u>punished</u> <u>by</u> <u>any</u> <u>other</u> <u>law</u>,
<u>the</u> <u>court</u> <u>shall</u> <u>sentence</u> <u>the</u> <u>accused</u> <u>to</u>
<u>an</u> <u>indeterminate</u> <u>sentence</u>, <u>the</u> <u>maximum</u> <u>term</u>
<u>of</u> <u>which</u> <u>shall</u> <u>not</u> <u>exceed</u> <u>the</u> <u>maximum</u>
<u>fixed</u> <u>by</u> <u>said</u> <u>law</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>minimum</u>
<u>shall</u> <u>not</u> <u>be</u> <u>less</u> <u>than</u> <u>the</u> <u>minimum</u>
<u>prescribed</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u>." (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There are, therefore, two categories of offenses which should be
taken into account in the application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law:  (1) offenses punished by the Revised Penal
Code, and (2) offenses punished by other laws (or special laws).</p>

<p class="BODY">The offenses <u>punished</u> <u><span style="">by</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u>
<u>Revised</u> <u>Penal</u> <u>Code</u> are those defined and penalized <span style="">in </span>Book II thereof, which is thus
appropriately titled CRIMES AND PENALTIES.  To simplify further, a crime is deemed <u>punished</u> <u>under</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Revised</u> <u>Penal</u> <u>Code</u> if it is defined by it, and none other,
as a crime and is punished by a penalty which is included in the classification
of Penalties in Chapter II, Title III of Book I thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, an offense is considered punished under <u>any</u>
<u>other</u> <u>law</u> (or special law) if it is not defined and penalized by
the Revised Penal Code but by such other law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that an offense is <u>punished</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Revised</u> <u>Penal</u> <u>Code</u> if both its definition and the penalty
therefor are found in the said Code, and it is deemed punished by a special law
if its definition and the penalty therefor are found in the special law.  That the latter imports or borrows from the
Revised Penal Code its nomenclature of penalties does not make an offense in
the special law <u>punished</u> <u>by</u> or <u>punishable</u> <u>under</u> the
Revised Penal Code.  The reason is quite
simple.  It is still the special law
that defines the offense and imposes a penalty therefor, although it adopts the
Code's nomenclature of penalties.  In
short, the mere use by a special law of a penalty found in the Revised Penal
Code can by no means make an offense thereunder an offense "punished or
punishable" by the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, I cannot subscribe to the view that since R.A. No. 7659 had
adopted the penalties prescribed by the Revised Penal Code in drug cases,
offenses related to drugs should now be considered as <u>punished</u> <u>under</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Revised</u> <u>Penal</u> <u>Code</u>.  If that were so, then we are also bound, ineluctably, to declare
that such offenses are <i>mala in se</i> and to apply the Articles of the
Revised Penal Code regarding the stages of a felony (Article 6), <span style="">the nature of participation </span>(Article
16), <span style="">accessory penalties </span>(Articles
40-45), <span style="">application of penalties to
principals, accomplices, and accessories </span>(Article 46 <i>et seq</i>.), <span style="">complex crimes </span>(Article 48), <span style="">and graduation of penalties </span>(Article
61), among <span style="">others.  We cannot do otherwise without being drawn
to an inconsistent posture which is extremely hard to justify.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I respectfully submit then that the adoption by the Dangerous
Drugs Act of the penalties in the Revised Penal Code does not make an offense
under the Dangerous Drugs Act an offense <u>punished</u> <u><span style="">by</span></u><span style=""> </span>the Revised Penal Code.  Consequently, where the proper penalty to be imposed under Section 20 of
the Dangerous Drugs Act is <i>prision correccional</i>, then, applying the
Indeterminate Sentence Law, the indeterminate sentence to be meted on the
accused should be that whose <u>minimum</u> should not be less than the minimum
prescribed by the special law (the Dangerous Drugs Act), <i>i.e</i>., not lower
than six (6) months and one (1) day of <i>prision correccional</i>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion holds the view that while the penalty
provided for in Section 20 of the Dangerous Drugs Act is a complex one composed
of three distinct penalties, <i>viz., prision correccional, prision mayor, </i>and<i>
reclusion temporal</i>, and that pursuant to Article 77 of the Revised Penal
Code, each should form a period, with the lightest of them being the minimum,
the next as the medium, and the most severe as the maximum, yet, considering
that under the said second paragraph of Section 20 the penalty <u>depends</u> <u>on</u>
<u>the</u> <u>quantity</u> of the drug subject of the criminal transaction,
then by way of exception to <span style="">Article 77
of </span>the Revised Penal Code and to subserve the purpose of Section 20, as
amended, each of the aforesaid component penalties shall be considered as a
principal penalty depending on the quantity of the drug involved.  Thereafter, applying the modifying
circumstances pursuant to Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code, the proper
period of the component penalty shall then be fixed.  To illustrate, if by the quantity of the drugs involved (<i>e.g.</i>,
marijuana below 250 grams) <span style="">the proper
principal penalty should be </span><i>prision correccional,</i> <span style="">but there is one mitigating and no aggravating
circumstance, then the penalty to be imposed should be <i><u>prision</u> <u>correccional</u></i>
<u>in</u> <u>its</u> </span><u>minimum</u> <u>period</u>.  <span style="">Yet,
the majority opinion puts a limit to such a rule.  It declares:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court rules, therefore, that while modifying
circumstances may be appreciated to determine the periods of the corresponding
penalties, or even reduce the penalty by degrees, in no case should such
graduation of penalties reduce the imposable penalty beyond or lower than <i>prision</i>
<i>correccional</i>.  It is for this
reason that the three component penalties in the second paragraph of Section 20
shall each be considered as an independent principal penalty, and that the
lowest penalty should in any event be <i>prision</i> <i>correccional</i> in
order not to depreciate the seriousness of drug offenses."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Simply put, this rule
would allow the reduction from </span><i>reclusion temporal</i> -- <span style="">if it is the penalty to be imposed on the
basis of the quantity of the drugs involved -- by two degrees, or to </span><i>prision
correccional</i>, <span style="">if there are two or
more mitigating circumstances and no aggravating circumstance is present </span><span style="">(paragraph 5, Article 64, Revised Penal Code)
</span>or if there is a <span style="">privileged
mitigating circumstance of, say, minority </span>(Article 68, Revised Penal
Code), <span style="">or under circumstances covered
by Article 69 of the Revised Penal Code.  Yet, if the proper penalty to be imposed is </span><i>prision mayor</i>,
<span style="">regardless of the fact that a reduction
by two degrees is proper, it should only be reduced by one degree because the
rule does not allow a reduction beyond </span><i>prision correccional</i>.  <span style="">Finally,
if the proper penalty to be imposed is </span><i>prision correccional</i>, <span style="">no reduction at all would be allowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I find the justification for the rule to be arbitrary and
unfair.  It is arbitrary because within
the same second paragraph involving the same range of penalty, we both <u>allow</u>
and <u>disallow</u> the application of Article 64(5), Article 68, and Article
69 of the Revised Penal Code.  The
reason for the disallowance, <i>viz</i>., in order not to depreciate the seriousness
of drug offenses, is unconvincing because Section 20 of the Dangerous Drugs
Act, as amended by R.A. No. 7659, has in fact "depreciated" the
seriousness of drug offenses by providing quantity as basis for the
determination of the proper penalty and limiting <u>fine</u> only to cases
punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.  It is unfair because an accused who is found guilty of possessing
MORE dangerous drugs -- say 500 to 749 grams of marijuana, in which case the
penalty to be imposed would be <i>reclusion temporal</i> -- ­may only be
sentenced to <span style="">six </span>(6) months and
one (1) day of <i>prision correccional</i> minimum because of privileged
mitigating circumstances.  Yet, an
accused who is found guilty of possession of only one (1) gram of marijuana --
in which case the penalty to be imposed is <i>prision correccional</i> -- would
not be entitled to a reduction thereof even if he has the same number of
privileged mitigating circumstances as the former has.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, if the privileged mitigating circumstance happens to be the
minority of the accused, then he is entitled to the reduction of the penalty as
a matter of right pursuant to Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code, which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 68.  <i>Penalty
to be imposed upon a person under eighteen years of age</i>. -- When the
offender is a minor under eighteen years and his case is one coming under the
provisions of the paragraph next to the last of Article 80 of this Code, the
following rules shall be observed:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.15in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Upon a person under fifteen but over nine years of age, who is
not exempted from liability by reason of the court having declared that he
acted with <span style="">discernment, </span>a
discretionary penalty shall be imposed, but always lower by two degrees at
least than that prescribed by law for the crime which he committed.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.15in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Upon a person over fifteen and under eighteen years of age the
penalty next lower than that prescribed by law shall be imposed, but always in
the proper period."</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not think that as to the second paragraph of Section 20 of
the Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended by Section 17 of R.A. No. 7659, we can be
at liberty to apply the Revised Penal Code in one aspect and not to apply it in
another.</p>
