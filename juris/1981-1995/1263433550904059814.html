				<BR><STRONG>NARVASA, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The capacity of a foreign corporation to maintain an action in
the Philippines against residents thereof, is the principal question in the
appellate proceedings at bar.  The issue
arises from the undisputed facts now to be briefly narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 23, 1987, Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc. (hereafter,
simply ML FUTURES) filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court at Quezon
City against the Spouses Pedro M. Lara and Elisa G. Lara for the recovery of a
debt and interest thereon, damages, and attorney's fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In its complaint ML FUTURES described itself as -</p>

<p class="NUM">a) "a non-resident foreign corporation, not doing business in
the Philippines, duly organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of
the state of Delaware, U.S.A.;" as well as</p>

<p class="NUM">b) a ‘futures commission merchant’ duly licensed to act as such in
the futures markets and exchanges in the United States, * * essentially
functioning as a broker ** (executing) orders to buy and sell futures contracts
received from its customers on U.S. futures exchanges."</p>

<p class="BODY">It also defined a "futures contract" as a
"contractual commitment to buy and sell a standardized quantity of a
particular item at a specified future settlement date and at a price agreed
upon, with the purchase or sale being executed on a regulated futures
exchange."</p>

<p class="BODY">In its complaint ML FUTURES alleged the following:</p>

<p class="NUM">1) that on September 28, 1983 it entered into a Futures Customer
Agreement with the defendant spouses (Account <span style="">No. </span>138-­12161), in virtue of which it agreed to act as the
latter's broker for the purchase and sale of futures contracts in the U.S.;</p>

<p class="NUM">2) that pursuant to the contract, orders to buy and sell futures
contracts were transmitted to ML FUTURES by the Lara Spouses "through the
facilities of Merrill Lynch Philippines, Inc., a Philippine corporation and a
company servicing plaintiff’s customers;"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3) that from the outset, the Lara Spouses "knew and were duly
advised that Merrill Lynch Philippines, Inc. was not a broker in futures
contracts," and that it "did not have a license from the Securities
and Exchange Commission to operate as a commodity trading advisor (i.e., ‘an
entity which, not being a broker, furnishes advice on commodity futures to
persons who trade in futures contracts’);</p>

<p class="NUM">4) that in line with the above mentioned agreement and through
said Merrill Lynch Philippines, Inc., the Lara Spouses actively traded in
futures contracts, including "stock index futures" for four years or
so, i.e., from 1983 to October, 1987,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
there being more or less regular accounting and corresponding remittances of
money (or crediting or debiting) made between the spouses and ML FUTURES;</p>

<p class="NUM">5) that because of a loss amounting to US$160,749.69 incurred in
respect of three <span style="">(3) </span>transactions
involving "index futures," and after setting this off against an
amount of US$75,913.42 then owing by ML FUTURES to the Lara Spouses, said
spouses became indebted to ML FUTURES for the ensuing balance of US$84,836.27,
which the latter asked them to pay;</p>

<p class="NUM">6) that the Lara Spouses however refused to pay this balance,
“alleging that the transactions were null and void because Merrill Lynch
Philippines, Inc., the Philippine company servicing accounts of plaintiff, **
had no license to operate as a ‘commodity and/or financial futures
broker.’"</p>

<p class="BODY">On the foregoing essential facts, ML FUTURES prayed (1) for a
preliminary attachment against defendant spouses’ properties "up to the
value of at least P2,267,139.50," and (2) for judgment, after trial,
sentencing the spouses to pay ML FUTURES:</p>

<blockquote>a) the Philippine
peso equivalent of $84,836.27 at the applicable exchange rate on date of
payment, with legal interest from date of demand until full payment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) exemplary damages in the sum of at least P500,000.00; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) attorney's fees and expenses of litigation as may be proven at
the trial.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Preliminary attachment issued <i>ex parte</i> on December 2,
1987, and the defendant spouses were duly served with summons.</p>

<p class="BODY">They then filed a motion to dismiss dated December 18, 1987 on
the grounds that:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) plaintiff ML FUTURES had "no legal capacity to sue"
and</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) its "complaint states no cause of action since ** (it) is
not the real party in interest."</p>

<p class="BODY">In that motion to dismiss, the defendant spouses averred that:</p>

<p class="NUM">a) although not licensed to do so, ML FUTURES had been doing
business in the Philippines "at least for the last four (4) years,"
this being clear from the very allegations of the complaint; consequently, ML
FUTURES is prohibited by law "to maintain or intervene in any action, suit
or proceeding in any court or administrative agency of the Philippines;"
and</p>

<p class="NUM">b) they had never been informed that Merrill Lynch Philippines,
Inc. was not licensed to do business in this country; and contrary to the
allegations of the complaint, all their transactions had actually been with
MERRILL LYNCH PIERCE FENNER &amp; SMITH, INC., and <i>not with ML FUTURES</i>
(Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc.), in proof of which they attached to their motion
to dismiss copies of eight (8) agreements, receipts  or reminders, etc., executed on standard printed forms of said
Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">ML FUTURES filed an OPPOSITION to the defendant spouses’ motion
to dismiss.  In that motion -</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">a)  it drew attention to paragraph 4 of its
complaint, admitted by defendants, that the latter "have been actively
trading in futures contracts ** in U.S. futures exchanges from 1983 to
1987," and ask, "If the trading ** (was) made in U.S., how could
plaintiff be doing business in the Philippines?"</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">b)  it also drew attention to a printed form of
"Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc." filled out and signed by defendant
spouses when they opened an account with ML Futures, in order to supply
information about themselves, including their bank's name --</p>

<blockquote>(1) in which appear
the following epigraph: "Account introduced by Merrill Lynch
International, Inc.," and the following statements, to wit::</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“This Commodity Trading Advisor (Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
&amp; Smith Philippines, Inc.) is prohibited by the Philippine Securities and
Exchange Commission from accepting funds in the trading advisor's name from a
client of Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc. for trading commodity interests.  All funds in this trading program must be
placed with Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc.;"</p>

<blockquote>and</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“ * * It is agreed between MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER &amp;
SMITH INC., and other account carrying MERRILL LYNCH entities and their
customers that all legal relationships between them will be governed by
applicable laws in countries outside the Philippines where sale and purchase
transactions take place."<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">c) and it argued that ?</p>

<blockquote>(1) it is not
permitted for defendant spouses to present "evidence" in connection
with a motion to dismiss based on failure of the complaint to state a cause of
action;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) even if the
documents appended to the motion to dismiss be considered as admissible
"evidence," the same would be immaterial since the documents refer to
a different account number: <i>138-12136</i>, the defendants’ account number
with ML FUTURES being <i>138-12161</i>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) it is a lie for
the defendant spouses to assert that they were never informed that Merrill
Lynch Philippines, Inc. had not been licensed to do business in the
Philippines; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) defendant
spouses should not be allowed to "invoke the aid of the court with unclean
hands."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendant spouses filed a REPLY reaffirming their lack of
awareness that Merrill Lynch Philippines, Inc. <i>(formerly registered as
Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Philippines, Inc.)</i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
did not have a license, claiming that they learned of this only from inquiries
with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission which elicited the information
that it had denied said corporation's application to operate as a commodity
futures trading advisor -- a denial subsequently affirmed by the Court of
Appeals (Merrill Lynch Philippines, Inc. v. Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission, <i>CA-G.R. No. 10821-SP</i>, Nov. 19, 1987).  The spouses also submitted additional
documents (Annexes J to R) involving transactions with Merrill Lynch Pierce
Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., dating back to 1980, stressing that all but one of
the documents "refer to Account No. 138-12161 which is the very account that
is involved in the instant complaint."</p>

<p class="BODY">ML FUTURES filed a Rejoinder alleging it had given the spouses a
disclosure statement by which the latter were made aware that the transactions
they were agreeing on would take place outside of the Philippines, and that
"all funds in the trading program must be placed with Merrill Lynch
Futures, Inc."</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 12, 1988, the Trial Court promulgated an Order
sustaining the motion to dismiss, directing the dismissal of the case and
discharging the writ of preliminary attachment.  It later denied ML FUTURES's motion for reconsideration, by Order
dated February 29, 1988.  ML FUTURES
appealed to the Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its own decision promulgated on November 27, 1990,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court of Appeals affirmed the Trial Court's judgment.  It declared that the Trial Court had seen
"through the charade in the representation of MLPI and the plaintiff that
MLPI is only a trading advisor and in fact it is a conduit in the plaintiff’s
business transactions in the Philippines as a basis for invoking the provisions
of Section 133 of the Corporation Code,"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><i>
viz.:</i></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 133.- <i>Doing business without a license</i>. - No
foreign corporation transacting business in the Philippines without a license,
or its successors or assigns, shall be permitted to maintain or intervene in
any action, suit or proceeding in any court or administrative agency in the
Philippines; but such corporation may be sued or proceeded against before
Philippine courts or administrative tribunals on any valid cause of action recognized
under Philippine laws."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It also declared that the evidence
established that plaintiff had in fact been "doing business" in this
country in legal contemplation, adverting to <i>Mentholatum v. Mangaliman</i>,
72 Phil. 524, 528-530, and Section 1 of Republic Act No. 5455 reading as
follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 1. <i>Definition and scope of this ACT</i>. (1) As used
in this Act, the term 'investment' shall mean equity participation in any

and the phrase 'doing business' <i>shall INCLUDE soliciting orders, purchases,

PERFORMANCE OF ACTS OR WORKS, OR THE EXERCISE OF SOME FUNCTIONS NORMALLY
INCIDENT TO, AND IN PROGRESSIVE PROSECUTION OF COMMERCIAL GAIN OR OF THE
PURPOSE AND OBJECT OF THE BUSINESS ORGANIZATION."</i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the claim that it was error for the Trial Court to
place reliance on the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.No. 10821-SP
--- sustaining the finding of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission that ML
FUTURES was doing business in the Philippines --- since that judgment was not
yet final and ML FUTURES was not a party to that proceeding, the Court of
Appeals ruled that there was no need to belabor the point considering that
there was, in any event, "adequate proof of the activities of MLPI ***
which manifestly show that the plaintiff (ML FUTURES) performed a series of
business acts, consummated contracts and undertook transactions for the period
from 1983 to October 1987," and because ML FUTURES had done so without
license, it consequently had "no legal personality to bring suit in
Philippine courts."</p>

<p class="BODY">Its motion for reconsideration having been denied,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
ML FUTURES has appealed to this Court on <i>certiorari</i>.  Here, it submits the following issues for
resolution:</p>

<blockquote>"(a)  Whether or not the annexes appended by the
Laras to their Motion to Dismiss and Reply filed with the Regional Trial Court,
but never authenticated or offered, constitute admissible evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  Whether or not in the proceedings below, ML
FUTURES has been accorded procedural due process.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)  Whether or not the annexes, assuming them
to be admissible, established that ML FUTURES was doing business in the
Philippines without a license."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As just stated, the Lara Spouses’ motion to dismiss was founded
on two (2) grounds:  (a) that the
plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue, and (b) that the complaint states no
cause of action (Sec. 1 [d], and [g], Rule 16, Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second ground, i.e., that the complaint states no
cause of action, the settled doctrine of course is that said ground must appear
on the face of the complaint, and its existence may be determined only by the
allegations of the complaint, consideration of other facts being proscribed,
and any attempt to prove extraneous circumstances not being allowed.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The test of the sufficiency of the facts alleged in a complaint as constituting
a cause of action is whether or not, admitting the facts alleged, the court
might render a valid judgment upon the same in accordance with the prayer of
the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, it is error for a judge to conduct a preliminary hearing and receive
evidence on the affirmative defense of failure of the complaint to state a
cause of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The other ground for dismissal relied upon, i.e., that the
plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue --- may be understood in two
senses:  one, that the plaintiff is
prohibited or otherwise incapacitated by law to institute suit in Philippine
Courts,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
or two, although not otherwise incapacitated in the sense just stated, that it
is not a real party in interest.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Now, the Lara Spouses contend that ML Futures has no capacity to sue them
because the transactions subject of the complaint were had by them, not with
the plaintiff ML FUTURES, but with <i>Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith,
Inc</i>.  Evidence is quite obviously
needed in this situation, for it is not to be expected that said ground, or any
facts from which its existence may be inferred, will be found in the averments
of the complaint.  When such a ground is
asserted in a motion to dismiss, the general rule governing evidence on motions
applies.  The rule is embodied in
Section 7, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7. <i>Evidence on motion</i>. --When a motion is based
on facts not appearing of record the court may hear the matter on affidavits or
depositions presented by the respective parties, but the court may direct that
the matter be heard wholly or partly on oral testimony or depositions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There was, to be sure, no affidavit or deposition attached to the
Lara Spouses' motion to dismiss or thereafter proffered in proof of the
averments of their motion.  The motion
itself was not verified.  What the
spouses did do was to refer in their motion to documents which purported to
establish that it was not with ML FUTURES that they had theretofore been
dealing, but another, distinct entity, Merril Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp;
Smith, Inc., copies of which documents were attached to the motion.  It is significant that ML FUTURES raised no
issue relative to the authenticity of the documents thus annexed to the Laras'
motion.  In fact, its arguments subsumed
the genuineness thereof and even adverted to one or two of them.  Its objection was centered on the propriety
of taking account of those documents as evidence, considering the established
principle that no evidence should be received in the resolution of a motion to
dismiss based on an alleged failure of the complaint to state a cause of
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being otherwise no question respecting the genuineness of
the documents, nor of their relevance to at least one of the grounds for
dismissal -- i.e., the prohibition on suits in Philippine Courts by foreign
corporations doing business in the country without license -- it would have
been a superfluity for the Court to require prior proof of their authenticity,
and no error may be ascribed to the Trial Court in taking account of them in
the determination of the motion <i>on the ground, not that the complaint fails
to state a cause of action -- as regards which evidence is improper and impermissible
-- but that the plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue -- respecting </i><i><span style="">which proof </span>may and should be
presented.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither may ML FUTURES argue with any degree of tenability that
it had been denied due process in the premises.  As just pointed out, it was very clear from the outset that the
claim of lack of its capacity to sue was being made to rest squarely on the
documents annexed thereto, and ML FUTURES had more than ample opportunity to
impugn those documents and require their authentication, but did not do
so.  To sustain its theory that there
should have been identification and authentication, and formal offer, of those
documents in the Trial Court pursuant to the rules of evidence would be to give
unwarranted importance to technicality and make it prevail over the substance
of the issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first question then, is, as ML FUTURES formulates it, whether
or not the annexes, assuming them to be admissible, establish that (a) ML
FUTURES is prohibited from suing in Philippine Courts because doing business in
the country without a license, and that (b) it is not a real party in interest
since the Lara Spouses had not been doing business with it, but with another
corporation, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is satisfied that the facts on record adequately
establish that ML FUTURES, operating in the United States, had indeed done
business with the Lara Spouses in the Philippines over several years, had done
so at all times through Merrill Lynch Philippines, Inc. (MLPI), a corporation
organized in this country and had executed all these transactions without ML
FUTURES being licensed to so transact business here, and without MLPI being
authorized to operate as a commodity futures trading advisor.  These are the factual findings of both the
Trial Court and the Court of Appeals.  These, too, are the conclusions of the Securities &amp; Exchange
Commission which denied MLPI's application to operate as a commodity futures
trading advisor, a denial subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeals.   Prescinding from the proposition that factual
findings of the Court of Appeals are generally conclusive, this Court has been
cited to no circumstance of substance to warrant reversal of said Appellate
Court's findings or conclusions in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is satisfied, too, that the Laras did transact business
with ML FUTURES through its agent corporation organized in the Philippines, it
being unnecessary to determine whether this domestic firm was MLPI (Merrill
Lynch Philippines, Inc.) or Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith, (MLPI's
alleged predecessor).  The fact is that
ML FUTURES did deal with futures contracts in exchanges in the United States in
behalf and for the account of the Lara Spouses, and that on several occasions
the latter received account documents and money in connection with those
transactions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given these facts, if indeed the last transaction executed by ML
FUTURES in the Lara’s behalf had resulted in a loss amounting to US
$160,749.69; that in relation to this loss, ML FUTURES had credited the Laras
with the amount of US$ 75,913.42 -- which it (ML FUTURES) then admittedly owed
the spouses -- and thereafter sought to collect the balance, US$84,836.27, but
the Laras had refused to pay (for the reasons already above stated), the
crucial question is whether or not ML FUTURES may sue in Philippine Courts to
establish and enforce its rights against said spouses, in light of the
undeniable fact that it had transacted business in this country without being
licensed to do so.  In other words, if it
be true that during all the time that they were transacting with ML FUTURES,
the Laras were fully aware of its lack of license to do business in the
Philippines, and in relation to those transactions had made payments to, and
received money from it for several years, the question is whether or not the
Lara Spouses are now estopped to impugn ML FUTURES’ capacity to sue them in the
courts of the forum.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that a party is estopped to challenge the personality
of a corporation after having acknowledged the same by entering into a contract
with <span style="font-size: 11pt;">it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span>And the "doctrine of estoppel to deny
corporate existence applies to foreign as well as to domestic
corporations;"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>

307, limited and distinguished in Dudley v. Collier, 87 Ala 431, 6 So 304;
Spinney v. Miller 114 Iowa 210, 86 NW 317), where such person has acted as
agent for the corporation and has violated his fiduciary obligations as such,
and where the statute does not provide that the contract shall be void, but
merely fixes a special penalty for violation of the statute. **.”<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>'The general rule that in the absence of fraud a person who has

<p class="BODY">There would seem to be no question that the Laras received
benefits generated by their business relations with ML FUTURES.  Those business relations, according to the
Laras themselves, spanned a period of seven (7) years; and they evidently found
those relations to be of such profitability as warranted their maintaining them
for that not insignificant period of time; otherwise, it is reasonably certain
that they would have terminated their dealings with ML FUTURES much, much
earlier.  In fact, even as regards their
last transaction, in which the Laras allegedly suffered a loss in the sum of
US$160,749.69, the Laras nonetheless still received some monetary advantage,
for ML FUTURES credited them with the amount of US$75,913.42 <span style="">then </span><span style="">due </span>to them, thus reducing their debt to US$84,836.27.  Given these facts, and assuming that the Lara
Spouses were aware from the outset that ML FUTURES had no license to do
business in this country and MLPI, no authority to act as broker for it, it
would appear quite inequitable for the Laras to evade payment of an otherwise
legitimate indebtedness due and owing to ML FUTURES upon the plea that it
should not have done business in this country in the first place, or that its
agent in this country, MLPI, had no license either to operate as a
"commodity and/or financial futures broker."</p>

<p class="BODY">Considerations of equity dictate that, at the very least, the
issue of whether the Laras are in truth liable to ML FUTURES and if so in what
amount, and whether they were so far aware of the absence of the requisite
licenses on the part of ML FUTURES and its Philippine correspondent, MLPI, as
to be estopped from alleging that fact as a defense to such liability, should
be ventilated and adjudicated on the merits by the proper trial court.</p>
