				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of a decision
of the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals) in AC-G.R. CV No.
70059 reversing the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> (now Regional Trial Court) in Civil Case No. 3861
entitled, "Francisca Salomon and Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> Blanco."</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts in this case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Salomon was the registered
owner of Lot No. 50 of the <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Irrigation Cadastre,
containing an area of 638 square meters, and covered by Original Certificate of
Title No. 283 of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is the father of petitioner Francisca
Salomon and <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Salomon, who is now deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter had two children, namely
petitioner Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 11, 1941, OCT No. 283 was cancelled by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 5333 in favor of the children of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
Salomon, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Francisca Salomon,
married to <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span>,
1/2 share of the lot, and <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Salomon, married to
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>, 1/2 share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> Salomon and
her husband Ramon <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span> died in 1950 and 1951,
respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the war, petitioner Francisca Salomon, acting as the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> of said lot, permitted <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>, mother of respondent <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>, to construct a house of light materials on
said lot, on the condition that <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> shall pay the taxes thereon, take good care of the
fruit trees on the lot and to vacate the land<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span>should the owners decide to use the same or should the latter
dispose or sell it to other persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1973, petitioner Salomon learned that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> built a house of
strong materials on the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An inquiry
from the Office of the Register of Deeds disclosed that TCT <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">No. </span>5333 was cancelled and TCT No. 7544
was issued on May 22, 1958 in the names of:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Francisca Salomon, widow - 1/2 share; Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>,
married to <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>,
1/4 share; and Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>, single, 1/4
share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Records also disclosed that on
the same date, TCT No. 7544 was cancelled and TCT <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">No. </span>7545 was issued in the name of respondent <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
basis of the said cancellation was a certain <span class="GramE">Extra</span>
judicial Partition with Absolute Sale purportedly executed on <st1:date year="1953" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1953</st1:date> before respondent <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> Blanco, then Justice of the Peace of <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>,
by petitioners Salomon and Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span> and by the
deceased co-owner Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Salomon submitted <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copies of the said deed for examination and analysis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The findings of the PC Crime Laboratory at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
revealed that the petitioners’ signatures, as appearing in the said document
were forgeries.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was thereafter brought by petitioner Salomon to the
Special Action Unit of <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> and to the Office
of Civil Relations of Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, respondent <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> still refused to return the property subject
of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioners filed
the complaint on <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1974</st1:date>
with the trial court to nullify the Extrajudicial Partition and Deed of
Absolute Sale dated <st1:date year="1953" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1953</st1:date>,
to cancel TCT Nos. 7544 and 7545 and to restore the efficacy of TCT No. 5333.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents filed their answers denying the facts in the
complaint and contending that sometime in the first week of August, 1953,
petitioner Francisca Salomon and the respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>
agreed to the sale of the aforementioned lot for P450.00, and that the
petitioner Francisca Salomon undertook to have all the necessary documents
prepared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They further submit that
petitioner Salomon supplied the technical description of the lot covered by TCT
No. 5333, and gave the names of Rogelio and Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>
and her own name to be placed as owners in the document; that respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> thereafter requested co-respondent Blanco, then
Justice of the Peace, to prepare the document based on facts given by
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents also tried to
show that on <st1:date year="1953" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1953</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> paid P450.00 as consideration to petitioner
Salomon who signed the receipt of payment in the presence of co-petitioner
Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>,
in the house of Salomon at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Inlong</span> and respondent's brother Miguel <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>
acted as witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents further
claimed that the following day, Salomon, Abraham and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span> signed and ratified the Extrajudicial Partition and
Deed of Absolute Sale in the presence of respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>
before <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> Blanco as Justice of the Peace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Blanco and <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ontingco</span>, a mail carrier, both acted as witnesses to the
signing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In May, 1958, respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> allegedly brought the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
signed document and TCT No. 5333 to the Register of Deeds for
registration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The title on the lot was
finally transferred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>the name <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1981</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> (now Regional

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, petitioner Salomon filed Administrative Case No.

in the absence of one of the supposed deponents, namely petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the trial court in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">civil </span>case, the respondents Blanco and <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> appealed to the respondent Intermediate Appellate
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1985</st1:date>,
the respondent appellate court rendered judgment reversing the decision of the

<p class="BODY">In its first assigned error, petitioner alleges that the
respondent appellate court did not give credence to the findings of PC Document
Examiners <span class="SpellE">Doctura</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span>
who found the signatures of petitioners on the questioned document as forged,
even as this Court had already ruled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>the
correctness of such findings in Administrative Matter No. 2505-MJ against Judge
<span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> Blanco who notarized the questioned deed of
Extrajudicial Partition with Absolute Sale in the absence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the supposed vendors, petitioners
herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this matter, the appellate court reversed the factual findings
of the trial court and held as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court is convinced that the findings of <span class="SpellE">Doctura</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span> have only
persuasive effects and not necessarily conclusive upon this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The positive testimonies of the witnesses to
the execution of said document are entitled to some weight as there is no
reason for them to be interested in this case, especially so in the case of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ontingco</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the petitioners’ allegations in its assigned error
meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although courts are not
ordinarily bound by expert testimonies, they may place whatever weight they
choose upon such testimonies in accordance with the facts of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The relative weight and sufficiency of expert
testimony is peculiarly within the province of the trial court to decide,
considering the ability and character of the witness, his actions upon the
witness stand, the weight and process of the reasoning by which he has
supported his opinion, his possible bias in favor of the side for whom he
testifies, the fact that he is a paid witness, the relative opportunities for
study or observation of the matters about which he testifies, and any other
matters which serve to illuminate his statements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The opinion of the expert may not be
arbitrarily rejected; it is to be considered by the court in view of all the
facts and circumstances in the case and when common knowledge utterly fails,
the expert opinion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">may </span>be given
controlling effect (20 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., 1056-1058).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem of the credibility of the expert
witness and the evaluation of his testimony is left to the discretion of the
trial court whose ruling thereupon is not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>the absence of an abuse of that
discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that respondents <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> Blanco
presented as witnesses Blanco himself both as judge notary and subscribing
witness to the said deed, and <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ongtingco</span>, as the other subscribing witness, who both
affirmed the genuineness of the said document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, petitioners presented Manuel <span class="SpellE">Doctura</span>,
Officer-in-Charge of the Questioned Document Section, PC Crime Laboratory, and <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span>, who had been a

 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Doctura</span> testified
that the signatures of petitioners on the deed of extra-judicial partition and
absolute sale did not appear to be the same signatures of the vendors,
petitioners herein, appearing on other documents bearing their undisputed
signatures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> and Blanco admitted the competency and
qualification of witness <span class="SpellE">Doctura</span> as a handwriting
expert although the latter died before he was cross-examined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, his testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">on </span>the forged signatures was not
stricken out from the records and was in fact corroborated by<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>the other expert witness <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tabo</span> was directed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by
</span>the court to compare the questioned signatures supposedly made in 1953
with the undisputed standard signatures made by petitioner Salomon in the years
1946, 1951 and 1952 (TSN, <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span>, December 15, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After noting the several differences between the standard signatures and
questioned signatures, document examiner <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span>
likewise testified and concluded that the signatures in the disputed document
were not made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span>petitioner
Salomon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In placing greater weight to the testimonies of the handwriting
experts than to the testimonies of the judge notary and subscribing witness <span class="SpellE">Ongtingco</span>, the trial court said <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"This Court is prone to believe the position taken by
plaintiffs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To prove the forgeries, no less than PC document examiners <span class="SpellE">Doctura</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span> testified and
were in unison in their conclusion that the signatures of both Francisca and
Abraham on the document (Exhibit A; Exhibit 2) were not theirs after comparison
with their sample standard signatures (Exhibits C, M, M-1 to M-7, N, N-1 to
N-17, O, O-1, P, P-1 to P-7, Q, Q-1, to Q-4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendants parried the claim of forgery by presenting
documents (Exhibit 6, 6-A, 6-B, 7, 7-A) to prove that the signatures of
Francisca and Abraham really belonged to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They tried to prop up their stand by the testimonies of subscribing
witnesses - the judge and the mail carrier-that all the parties did really sign
the document.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court accords greater respect to the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Doctura</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span>, experts to the
very line which is the subject of <span class="GramE">examination, that</span> is
handwritten.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This especially when they
arrived at their unanimous, verdict after comparison of the questioned
signatures of Francisca and Abraham on documents executed close and proximate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>August 10, 1953, the date of the
execution of the questioned documents (Reyes v. Vidal, 96 Phil. 130) (sic).</blockquote>

document in question, the judge acting as notary public <u>ex</u> <u>officio</u>,
who in defense of his position <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">would </span>naturally
not dispute the authenticity of the very document he had notarized, and the
mail carrier who was merely picked up by <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> at
the spur of the moment, this court would give greater and heavier weight and
credence to the expertise of document examiners <span class="SpellE">Doctura</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tabo</span> testifying on technical matters which beyond
doubt are their domain (Lopez vs. Court of Appeals, L-31494, Jan. 23, 1978, 81
SCRA 153" (pp. 29-32, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Aside from relying on the expert testimonies, the trial judge
also based its conclusion of forgery on the physical appearance and condition
of the questioned document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As observed
by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"The aforementioned defects in the document would show how
inaccurately and hurriedly it was prepared and in the process vital data were
misstated and some necessary details added.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The characteristic haste in the preparation of the document was best
exemplified in the typographical errors and erasures apparently pictured
thereon muddling the document's facial authenticity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Even the identity of the one who prepared the document was
quandary by itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For in her Answer
(par. 5(c)) the document while in her testimony (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
pp. 6, 7, 8, <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1977</st1:date>)
she claimed she was the one responsible for its preparation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the judge chipped in the confusion when
he assuredly stated that he prepared the document upon instructions of <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> who supplied him some of the data (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 3, 4, 5, <st1:date year="1979" day="3" month="5">May
 3, 1979</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the very
appearance of the document it could be gauged that <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span>
threw into the lap of the judge the job of completing the contents thereof
through various additions and in the absence of plaintiffs." <span class="GramE">(pp. 32-33, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We accord respect to the conclusions of the lower court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The condition and physical appearance of a
questioned document may help in determining whether it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">is </span>genuine or forged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subscribing witnesses may forget or exaggerate what they really know,
saw, heard or did; they may be biased and therefore, tell only half truths to
mislead the court or favor one party to the prejudice of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This cannot be said of the condition and
physical appearance of the questioned document itself (<span class="SpellE">Junquera</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, et al., No. L-18498, <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1967</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, factual findings show, and these
were not overturned by the appellate court, that petitioner Salomon was not
present during the time that the questioned document was allegedly signed and
ratified before judge<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">-</span>notary
Blanco.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The totality of evidence on
record and the existence of several factors and circumstances surrounding the
disputed deed of partition and sale, which <span class="GramE">We</span> shall
enumerate herein, leave no alternative to this Court but to accept the
conclusion that the said deed was forged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) the expert
testimonies of two handwriting experts both declaring that the signatures of
petitioners in the deed were forged; 2) the inconsistent allegations of the
respondents in their answer and in their testimonies as to who took charge of
the preparation of the questioned document; 3) the physical appearance of the
document showing several typographical errors and insertions on its face; 4)
the discrepancies and mistakes in the facts and contents of the said document;
5) the visible difference between the signatures of petitioner Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span> in the first and second pages of the document <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">as </span>correctly examined by the trial
court; 6) the absence of petitioner Salomon during the time of the alleged
signing and notarization of the document before Justice of the Peace <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> Blanco.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it is error for the respondent appellate court to disregard
the findings of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although the rule is settled that the findings of fact of the Court of
Appeals are final and non-<span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> on appeal, this
case, however, falls within the exceptions to this rule, wherein the factual
findings of the respondent appellate court are contrary to those of the trial
court and are mere conclusions without citation of specific evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that a reversal of the findings of the appellate court becomes
proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is generally recognized that
the conclusions and findings of facts by the trial court are entitled to great
weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless for strong and cogent reasons
because the trial court is in a better position to examine real evidence as
well as to observe the demeanor of witnesses while testifying on the case (<span class="SpellE">Macua</span> v. Intermediate Appellate Court, No. 70810, October
26, 1987, 155 SCRA 29).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No compelling
reasons or clear specific contrary evidence are cited by the respondent
appellate court to justify the reversal of the lower court’s findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Between the factual findings of the appellate
court and the trial court, the trial court's conclusion must prevail over the
appellate court (<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> v. Court of Appeals, 55 SCRA
547).</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent their second assigned error, petitioners allege that the
issuance of the Transfer Certificate of Title No. 7545 to respondent <span class="SpellE">Araceli</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> was by means of
forgery of the questioned document and is therefore, null and void; that since
an action to declare the nullity of a contract does not prescribe under the
law, the respondent appellate court erred in ruling that petitioner's action
was brought beyond the prescribed period of four years in cases of annulment of
contracts.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is impressed with merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1391 of the Civil Code provides that
an action to annul a contract on the ground of vitiated consent must be filed
within four years from the discovery of the vice of consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar however, involves not a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> contract tainted with fraud, mistake, undue
influence or intimidation as grounds for its nullification but a contract that
is totally null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
declared in their complaint that they had not signed nor acknowledged the
questioned deed of extra-judicial partition with absolute sale of the
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="GramE">We</span>
found to have been sufficiently proven as found by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This means that they had not given their
consent to the sale of the lot in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the absence of such consent made the
said document null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">initio</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>and is subject to attack at any time
(<span class="SpellE">Baranda</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Baranda</span>, No.
73275, May 20, 1987, 150 SCRA 59).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it is recognized in our jurisprudence that a forded deed is a
nullity and conveys no title (Director of Lands v. Seymour Addison, et al., 49
Phil. 19).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, Article 1410
of the Civil Code clearly provides that an action to declare the inexistence of
void contracts does not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prescribe </span>(<span class="SpellE">Teja</span> Marketing v. IAC, 148 SCRA 347).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, <span class="GramE">We</span> have
consistently ruled that when there is a showing of such illegality, the
property registered is deemed to be simply held in trust for the real owner by
the person in whose name it is registered, and the former then has the right to
sue for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The action for the purpose is also <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
long as the land wrongfully registered under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
system is still in the name of the person who caused such registration, an
action in <span class="SpellE">personam</span> will lie to compel him to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the property to the real owner (<span class="SpellE">Baranda</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Baranda</span>, No. 73275,
May 20, 1987, 150 SCRA 59).</p>

<p class="BODY">In their third assignment of error, petitioners submit that they
have not incurred <span class="SpellE">laches</span> in seeking the return of the
property; that after their discovery of the issuance of TCT No. 7545 in the
name of respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> in 1973, they took
immediate steps to vindicate their rights on the said lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning this matter, the respondent appellate court said
otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It found from the records
that petitioner Salomon went home every year to <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> since 1953 and visited <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> in the latter's house on the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It likewise held that in the case of
petitioner Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>, the latter admitted that
from time to time he went to the municipal building which is near <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From
these facts, the appellate court concluded that it is improbable that
petitioners could not have noticed the house of strong materials built on the
questioned lot during the period of time from 1953 up to 1976 when petitioners
filed their action.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts
cited above do not sufficiently prove <span class="SpellE">laches</span> on the
part of petitioners. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Laches</span>,
in a general sense, means the failure or neglect, for an unreasonable and
unexplained length of time, to do that, which, by exercising due diligence,
could or should have done earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a
presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned or
declined to assert it (Chung Ka Bio, et al. v. IAC, G.R. 71837, July 26, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">What the records clearly show is that petitioner Francisca
Salomon admitted that she went to the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pilar</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
once or twice from 1953 and 1972 to attend fiestas (TSN, Francisca Salomon, May
28, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, however, does not
establish in any manner, that she had in fact, actually seen the construction
of the house by respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> during the said
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, although co-petitioner
Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span> often went to the municipal building
in <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, he could not see the house of respondent <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> because it was partly hidden from view, and that
he could not establish the exact year when he first noticed the new house
during the period between 1952 and 1972 (TSN, Abraham <span class="SpellE">Gatdula</span>,
July 2, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Records show that when
petitioners discovered in 1972 the cancellation of title in their names, they
immediately took steps to protect their rights to the land, by:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) the filing of an adverse claim with the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> on June 21, 1973; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">2) </span>submission of copies of the deed of
extrajudicial partition and sale to the PC Crime Laboratory at Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span> for examination and analysis of the signatures
appearing thereon; 3) the filing of an administrative case with the Supreme
Court against respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> Blanco wherein
We found the latter guilty as charged; and 4) the filing of Civil Case No. 3861
against respondents for nullification of title issued in the name of respondent
<span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
diligence of petitioners as shown above in pursuing their interests cannot be
gainsaid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the length of time
which had elapsed from the date of transfer of title in 1958 up to the time the
complaint was filed in 1974, which amounted to sixteen (16) years, is not too
unreasonable to permit the assertion and enforcement of petitioners' rights to
their land, taking into account the <span class="SpellE">imprescriptibility</span>
of the action herein and the distance of the disputed lot in <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> from the places of residence of petitioners
especially <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>of Salomon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in view of the foregoing discussion, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that the award of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation by the
respondent appellate court in favor of respondents as against petitioners is
unjustified and has no legal basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, the case filed by the petitioners is not an unfounded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">civil </span>action but on the contrary, a
legal course of action to vindicate their rights to the land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Intermediate Appellate
Court (now Court of Appeals) dated January 8, 1985 is hereby reversed, and the
