				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> of the decision (pp. 27-31,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) of the Court of Appeals dated January
13, 1987 in CA-G.R. SP. No. 09391 entitled "Spouses <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandoy</span>,
Petitioners, vs. Hon. Luis L. Victor, in his capacity as Presiding Judge,
Branch XCVI, RTC, and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Empaynado</span>, Respondents,"
which affirmed the decisions of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital
Region, Branch XCVI, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, dismissing the
herein petitioners' complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction due to the lack of demand to pay rentals and to
vacate the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Spouses <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandoy</span> herein
petitioners, were lessees of a residential house and lot owned by the
University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and located at No. 88-D, <span class="GramE">phase</span> 4, <span class="SpellE">Pook</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amorsolo</span>, U.P. Campus, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in April 1984, petitioners sublet certain spaces of the
property to Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Empaynado</span>, herein private
respondent, for a monthly rental of P550.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Empaynado</span> failed to pay the rental for the
month of July, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon demand by
petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Empaynado</span> still failed and refused to
pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners brought the matter to the office of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain for settlement, but to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1985</st1:date>, a certification to file action against Domingo <span class="SpellE">Enpaynado</span> for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> and
non-payment of house rentals including light and water (Annex "A‚Äù to the
petition, p. 10, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) was issued by the
office of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1985</st1:date>,
petitioners filed a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against <span class="SpellE">Empaynado</span> and attached thereto the certification to file
action issued by the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was filed with the Metropolitan
Trial Court of Metro Manila, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city> and docketed as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">XXXV-48898.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, <span class="SpellE">Enpaynado</span> admitted that
he did not pay the rentals since July 1985 but denied that there was a demand
to vacate and pay made upon him by spouses <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandoy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, judgment was rendered in favor of the spouses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision, dated <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1986</st1:date> reads, in part:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At any rate, the court is of the view that a demand to vacate
before the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> court is a substantial equivalent
of the required extrajudicial demand to pay and vacate required by the Rules of
Court prior to the filing of an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of
plaintiff spouses <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bandoy</span> ordering the defendant Domingo <span class="SpellE">Ernpaynado</span> and all persons claiming rights under him to
vacate the residential house or extension thereof at the lot known as No. 88-D,
Phase 4, <span class="SpellE">Pook</span> <span class="SpellE">Amorsolo</span>,
U.P. Campus and to surrender the same peacefully to the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendant is likewise required to pay all
unpaid rentals at the rate of P550.00 a month from July 1985 up to the time the
defendant vacates the premises at bar; and to pay the plaintiff P700.00 as
reasonable attorney's fee and the costs of suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (pp. 21-22, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Domingo <span class="SpellE">Empaynado</span> appealed the decision
to the Regional Trial Court which rendered a decision dated <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1986</st1:date> dismissing the case for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> for lack of jurisdiction on the part of the trial
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, in the light of the foregoing disquisition, on
the ground of lack of jurisdiction, the decision appealed from is hereby set
aside and this case ordered dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (p. 25, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Spouses <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandoy</span> filed a petition
for review of the decision of the Regional Trial Court the Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1987</st1:date>, the Court of
Appeals dismissed the case also for lack of jurisdiction on the part of the
trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision reads, in
part:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"And where the Metropolitan Trial Court did not acquire
jurisdiction, the above jurisprudence would hold and all we can do is to
dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, there having been no error committed by the
Regional Trial Court, the petition for review is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (pp. 30-31, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeals,
petitioners come to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on a lone assignment of error,
that:</p>

<blockquote>"THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED
IN DENYING THE PETITION FOR REVIEW AND IN AFFIRMING THE RULING OF THE REGIONAL
TRIAL COURT THAT THE METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT DID NOT ACQUIRE JURISDICTION OVER
THE CASE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of petitioners that no further demand to
vacate was made by petitioners after the certification to file was issued by
the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> captain for the reason that the case was
already certified for court action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under this situation, any further demand to vacate was merely repetitive
and unnecessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in this contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the complaint contains no allegation that
there was a prior demand to vacate made by the petitioners upon private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled rule that
"where the complaint contains no allegation that a demand had been made
upon the defendant to vacate the premises but only an allegation that a demand
was made for payment of the rentals agreed upon, it is held that such
allegation is insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon a justice of the peace
court" (<span class="SpellE">Casilan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tomassi</span>,
et al., 10 SCRA 261, 264; Santos vs. <span class="SpellE">Vivas</span>, 96 Phil,
538, 540).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The certification issued by
the office of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain is not conclusive
as to the jurisdiction of the court to which the case was subsequently
filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What was certified by the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain was that no settlement was reached by the
parties in the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> level.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It did not certify that all the requisites
for the filing of an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case had been
complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Co <span class="SpellE">Tiamco</span> vs. Diaz, L-7,
<st1:date year="1946" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1946</st1:date> (75 Phil.
672), relied upon by petitioners, there was no allegation in the complaint that
a notice to quit or vacate was made upon the defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, during the presentation of evidence,
plaintiffs offered Exhibit "A" as evidence, which is a notice to quit
alleged to have been served upon defendants prior to the filing of the
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was objected to by the
defendants and the objection was sustained by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendants filed with the Court of First
Instance a petition for <i>mandamus</i> to compel the municipal court judge to
admit Exhibit "A".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By virtue
of a writ of <i>mandamus</i> issued by the Court of First Instance, the
evidence was admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that case, it
was held that:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">even</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>supposing
without conceding, that the complaint is deficient (in not alleging the notice
to quit) the deficiency was cured by the evidence," (p. 679, supra)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But, the above case of Co <span class="SpellE">Tiamco</span> cannot
be applied in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the Co <span class="SpellE">Tiamco</span> case, it was proven that there was indeed a notice
to quit or demand to vacate served upon the defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The notice to vacate was offered and admitted
in evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the
complaint was defective because of its failure to allege that there was a prior
demand to vacate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defect was not
cured because no evidence of a prior demand to vacate was presented in the
trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Empaynado</span> relied upon by the trial judge to the effects
that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">na</span></span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">tinutukoy</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamis</span> <span class="SpellE">Bandoy</span> <span class="SpellE">dahil</span> <span class="SpellE">di</span>
<span class="SpellE">umano'y</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">di</span> <span class="SpellE">magandang</span> <span class="SpellE">asal</span>

not prove that the spouses demanded that he vacate the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What <span class="SpellE">Empaynado</span>
admitted in the said affidavit was that the spouses intended to expel him out
of the premises ("gusto <span class="SpellE">niyang</span> <span class="SpellE">paalisin</span>") but has not actually or definitely demanded
that he vacate the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
intention to oust is different from an actual or definite demand to
vacate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the latter which confers
jurisdiction upon the municipal court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DENIED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of respondent Court of Appeals
is affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
