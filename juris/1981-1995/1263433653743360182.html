				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On 27 August 1974, petitioner Widows' and Orphans Association,
Inc. ("Widora") instituted Land Registration Case<sup> </sup>("LRC")
No. Q-336 before Branch 4 of the Court of First Instance of Quezon City (now
Branch 83 of the Regional Trial Court, same city).  Widora applied for original registration of title over a parcel
of land described in Plan LRC(SWO)-15352, alleging that said property is
covered by <u>Titulo Propiedad No. 4136</u> dated 25 April 1894, supposedly
issued in the name of one, deceased, Mariano San Pedro y Esteban.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In an amended application, Widora stated that the land applied for was situated
at Malitlit-Ugong, Quezon City, with an area of 156 hectares.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 October 1978, private respondent Ortigas &amp; Co. Limited
Partnership, Inc. ("Ortigas") filed an opposition to the application.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In a supplementary report dated 14 November 1978, the
Commissioner of Land Registration informed the trial court that the land sought
to be registered was “identically the same" as that covered by Lot 7 of
Transfer Certificate of Title ("TCT") No. 77652 and of Lot 8 of TCT
No. 77653, both of which were issued and standing in the name of Ortigas.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated 20 April 1979, the trial court set the case for
hearing to enable Widora to prove its assertion that TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653
were not derived from the Original Certificates of Title ("OCT")
referred to on their faces (i.e., OCT Nos. 19, 336, 337 and 344) and to give
Ortigas an opportunity to show the contrary.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For nine (9) years, from 1979 until 1988, hearings were held
where the parties adduced evidence in support of their respective contentions.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated 30 March 1988, the trial court denied Ortigas'
motion to dismiss, holding that its TCT's were apparently not derived from the
OCT's mentioned on their faces and did not appear to have been based on an
existing original decree of registration.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Ortigas' motion for reconsideration having been denied, and the
trial court having set the case for hearing on the merits, Ortigas filed a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction
with the public respondent Court of Appeals on 10 July 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated 27 November 1989, the Court of Appeals gave
due course to the petition and nullified the trial court's order of 30 March
1988.  It held that TCT Nos. 77652 and
77653 were derived from OCT No. 351, which in turn was based on Decree of
Registration No. 1425 issued in favor of Ortigas’ predecessor-in-interest in
1905, in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917 which had been tried by the Land Registration
Court of Manila.  The Court of Appeals
dismissed LRC No. Q-336 because the land subject thereof was already,
registered in favor of Ortigas, with the result that the trial court had no
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, Widora filed
the present petition for review with the Court on 22 March 1990.  In a decision dated 28 August 1991, the
Court's Third Division set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals and
reinstated the order of the trial court dated 30 March 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court's Third Division held that the Court of Appeals erred
in making factual findings determinative of Widora's application on the basis
of "secondary evidence" offered by Ortigas, in unilaterally
correcting entries in the Ortigas Torrens titles and held that the controversy
regarding the authenticity of said titles should be resolved in
"full-blown" hearings before the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present Motion for Reconsideration filed by Ortigas.</p>

<p class="BODY">Examination of the Court's Decision of 28 August 1991 shows that
two (2) considerations led the Court to remand this case to the trial court to
hear Widora's application for land registration on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, the Court was apparently not entirely certain that the
land covered by Widora's application was already registered under the Torrens
system in Ortigas' name, such that it appeared prudent to conduct a
"full-blown" trial on the merits to clear up that matter,
considering:  (1) Ortigas argued that
its ownership of the land which is the subject of Widora's application was
confirmed by Decree No. 1425 issued in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917 of the Land
Registration Court of Manila in 1905; however, Widora's evidence tended to show
that Decree No. 1425 adjudicated to Ortigas only seventeen (17) hectares of
land situated in Sta. Ana, Manila, while Widora's application related to one
hundred fifty-six (156) hectares of land situated in Quezon City; and (2) it
appeared that Ortigas’ TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653 carry some erroneous statements
on their face, relating to "their source or mother Original Certificate of
Title (OCT)" lending some credence to Widora's contention that the
genuineness of those TCTs was dubious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second consideration was the feeling that the Court of
Appeals should not have resolved these factual uncertainties by using
"secondary" evidence offered by Ortigas, considering the limited
nature of <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction, since Torrens titles are conclusive
on their face and any inaccuracies of entries thereon are to be corrected only
by the proper land registration court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Motion for Reconsideration and in the oral hearing on that
Motion, Ortigas invited our attention to the existence of previously decided
cases showing that the factual uncertainties we had noted had already been
adjudicated by the Court with finality and are now matters of judicial notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this Resolution, the Court will address this principal
argument of Ortigas as well as the argument concerning the character of
evidence submitted by Ortigas before the trial court.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In holding that the Court of Appeals should not have resolved the
factual issues considering the nature of <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction, the
Court relied on <u>Dioquino v. Intermediate Appellate Court</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In <u>Dioquino</u>, this Court rejected the factual findings made by the Court
of Appeals in the course of resolving a petition for review filed under Section
22, B.P. Blg. 129, because, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, those factual findings
were based on evidence presented <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> as appendices to a
motion for reconsideration from the decision of the trial court.  Considering that no evidence had been
presented by either party in the principal proceedings, either before the
Municipal Circuit Trial Court or before the Regional Trial Court, the Court in <u>Dioquino</u>
concluded that the Court of Appeals’ power to resolve issues of fact under
Section 9, paragraph 2, B.P. Blg. 129, was misapplied because the opposing
party had no real opportunity to reject the evidence submitted <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u>
by its opponent.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; text-transform: uppercase;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Careful examination of the <u>Dioquino</u> case shows that the
facts there are so different from those of the present case as to render our
holding in <u>Dioquino</u> inapplicable here.  Here, the Court of Appeals had conducted hearings on four (4) occasions,
during which it required both parties to present evidence to establish their
respective contentions on Ortigas’ right to a writ of preliminary
injunction.  At these hearings, both
parties reproduced before the Court of Appeals the <u>same</u> evidence they
had adduced before the trial court during the 9-year long hearings on Ortigas’
motion to dismiss, which evidence tended to support their respective
contentions on the derivation of Ortigas's TCTs.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the acceptance of <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> evidence which the Court
rejected in <u>Dioquino</u>, never occurred in the instant case.  Moreover, the determination of whether an
inferior court had arbitrarily disregarded preponderant evidence of record
adduced in protracted hearings before it, is a proper subject of inquiry by an
appellate court in a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II.</p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at its conclusion that TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653 are
proper derivatives of OCT No. 351, which in turn had been issued pursuant to Decree
No. 1425, the Court of Appeals had relied on (a) a certified true copy of OCT
No. 351; (b) survey plans prepared by Ortigas’ Geodetic Engineer, Mr. Carlos
Angeles, which were based on plottings of the boundaries of parcels of land
appearing in the Notice of Initial Hearing in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917 and in
the technical description found in the body of OCT No. 351, and in TCT Nos.
77652 and 77653; and (c) the testimony of Engineer Angeles that these plottings
showed that the land covered by the TCTs was inside the larger parcel of land
covered by the OCT, which in turn was inside the much larger parcel of land
(The Hacienda de Mandaloyon) adjudicated to Ortigas' predecessor-in-interest by
Decree No. 1425 issued in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
As noted earlier, the above evidence had been presented by Ortigas before the
trial court during the prolonged hearings on its motion to dismiss.  The Court described the above evidence as
"secondary" in nature and noted that Ortigas did not establish the
due execution and subsequent loss of the original documents, as required by the
Rule on Secondary Evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
After careful re-examination of the evidence of record and applicable rules of
evidence, the Court considers that the word "secondary evidence" was
inaccurate.  The copy of OCT No. 351
offered by Ortigas was a certified true copy of the original thereof found in
the Registration Book of the Register of Deeds of Rizal.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The admissibility of such a copy in court proceedings is an exception to the
ordinary rule on secondary evidence;<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
such admissibility is in fact mandated by Section 47 of Act No. 496 (The Land
Registration Act).<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the Land Registration Act which was in force at the time OCT No. 351 was
issued, the original thereof found in the Registration Book of the Register of
Deeds of Rizal was an <u>official transcript of Decree No. 1425, with respect
to the land covered by such decree situated in the Province of Rizal</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, OCT No. 351 constitutes direct proof of the existence of
Decree No. 1425 upon which the Ortigas TCTs (Nos. 77652 and 77653) are
based.  We believe further that the
Court of Appeals was justified in relying upon the plotting prepared by
Engineer Carlos Angeles and his testimony explaining the significance thereof,
notwithstanding the secondary nature of that plotting and testimony.  For, as will be seen shortly, the
authenticity and correctness of these survey plans and of Engineer Angeles's
explanation thereof had already been judicially sustained in previously decided
cases.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Motion for Reconsideration and its supporting memorandum,
Ortigas argued that the seeming factual uncertainties relating to its TCTs
which had impelled the Court to order a remand of this case to the trial court,
had already been resolved with finality in previously decided cases and are now
matters of judicial notice.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have reviewed the underlying record carefully and must
conclude that this claim of Ortigas is impressed with considerable merit.  When evidence of record in the instant case
is considered together with the findings and conclusions embodied in previously
decided cases, the factual uncertainties initially feared by the Court are
dissipated.  In truth, resolution of
these uncertainties results from the application of the principle of <u>res</u>
<u>adjudicata</u> and of its two (2) component concepts, i.e., conclusiveness
of judgment and bar by prior judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as 1906, in <u>Cia Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo, et.
al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court affirmed on appeal the trial court's confirmation of the title of La
Compania Agricola de Ultramar as registered owner under the Torrens System of
the Hacienda de Mandaloyon.  Such
confirmation, referring to title over a specific thing, has now acquired
immutability and incontestability.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>  Thus, in <u>Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court ruled that the Ortigas &amp; Co. Ltd. Partnership was the
successor-in-interest of La Compania Agricola de Ultramar and can invoke the
benefits of the Court's 1906 ruling, under the doctrine of the law of the case,
to defeat an action for annulment of some of its transfer certificates of title
on the ground of alleged fraud.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court noted in its 1906 decision that the identity and area
of the Hacienda de Mandaloyon were not disputed by the oppositors in the land
registration proceeding.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither was the validity of the land registration proceeding therein impugned
by said oppositors.  Hence the Court had
no<b> </b>occasion<b> </b>there to discuss the detailed matters dealt with
below.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in at least two subsequent cases cited by Ortigas, the
Supreme Court had occasion to affirm decisions rendered by the Court of
Appeals, based on facts adduced before the Courts of First Instance, clarifying
these matters.  The legal conclusions
drawn in these two cases, as well as the factual findings on which they were based,
supplemented the Cia. Agricola ruling and demonstrate that the land
registration court hearing Widora's application in LRC No. Q-336, could not
have acquired jurisdiction over the land subject of the application, since that
land is already registered under the Torrens system (TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653)
and in fact formed part of a larger tract of land similarly previously brought
under the Torrens system in the name of Ortigas' predecessor-in-interest.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first of these cases, <u>Felipe C. Navarro v. Ortigas
&amp; Co. Ltd. Partnership</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court affirmed in 1979 by way of a minute resolution the decision of the
Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. No. 53125-R dated 13 December 1978.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
In that decision, the Court of Appeals established that the land registration
application of La Compania Agricola de Ultramar over the Hacienda de Mandaloyon
was granted under Decree No. 1425, actually issued under G.L.R.O. Record No.
917 by the Land Registration Court of Manila in 1905, the very same Decree
affirmed by this Court in its 1906 decision.  The Court of Appeals noted that Ortigas had established this proposition
by offering an extant portion of Decree No. 1425 covering land within the
territorial jurisdiction of the City of Manila, which "coincides with a
portion of the entire vast tract of land embraced by the technical description
appearing in the notice of initial hearing published in the Manila American and
(in) La Democracia (English and Spanish language newspapers of general
circulation existing in 1904, certified true copies of which were offered in
evidence by Ortigas) and was distinctly shown in a map or sketch plotted by Mr.<b>
</b>Carlos Angeles, Geodetic Engineer."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By way of background, the <u>Navarro</u> case involved a suit for
injunction instituted by Ortigas on 11 February 1972 before Branch 16 of the
Court of First Instance of Rizal [docketed as Civil Case No. Q-16265] in order
to restrain a certain Felipe Navarro from fraudulently selling portions of its
property to innocent third persons.  Felipe Navarro was allegedly the attorney-in-fact of the physical
occupants of a 17,955 square meter parcel of land owned by Ortigas and bounded
by Amado T. Reyes St., Harapin ng Bukas St. and Luna St., San Juan,
Manila.  Felipe Navarro answered the
complaint by impugning the validity of the Torrens titles held by Ortigas over
the entire Hacienda de Mandaloyon, situated partially in Manila, partially in
Quezon City and partially in Pasig,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
because, among other things, they were allegedly declared void in a decision
rendered by Branch 15 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal in<b> </b>Civil
Case No. 7-M(10339).<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, CFI Judge Sergio Apostol rejected Navarro's
contention in a decision granting injunction dated 16 December 1972, holding
that the Ortigas titles were indefeasible, being based on Decree No. 1425
issued in 1905.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before reaching the conclusion that the Ortigas titles had become
indefeasible, Judge Apostol satisfied himself as to the existence of original
Decree of Registration No. 1425, issued in 1905 in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917,
from which these titles were derived:</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual matters raised, controverted, litigated and
established in G.R. No. 50156 (<u>Navarro v. Ortigas</u>) which are relevant to
the present case are as follows:  1) the
inaccuracies in the sourcing of the mother titles of TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653
did not impair their probative value as evidence of Ortigas' ownership over the
land described in their technical descriptions; 2) the Registry of Deeds of
Manila was the source of an original copy of Decree No. 1425 to the extent that
that Decree covered property situated in Manila; but this Decree, in its
entirety, really covers much more, i.e., the entire Hacienda de Mandaloyon; 3)
the extant sources of the boundaries of the Hacienda de Mandaloyon are the
technical descriptions thereof appearing in the initial notice of hearing in
G.L.R.O. Record No. 917; and 4) the land described in and covered by TCT Nos.
77652 and 77653 formed part of the Hacienda de Mandaloyon.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the doctrine of conclusiveness of judgment, these factual
matters established in G.R. No. 50156 are binding on Widora and can no longer
be relitigated by it in G.R. No. 91797.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>  Both cases, to a certain extent, involve the
same subject matter (i.e., the parcels of land described in Ortigas' TCT Nos.
77652 and 77653.  Ortigas' cause of
action in G.R. No. 50156 consisted of the fraudulent sales of its property made
by Felipe Navarro in behalf of his "owner"- clients.  That differs somewhat from Ortigas' cause of
action in G.R. No. 91797, which consists of the adverse claim of ownership
asserted by Widora over Ortigas' property, manifested through the filling of
Widora's application for land registration.  But more importantly, there is a <u>substantial</u> identity between
Felipe Navarro (and his clients) on one hand and Widora on the other; both
parties sought to question the validity of Decree No. 1425 and its particular
derivatives here involved (TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653), insofar as<i> </i>the
Decree had adjudicated in favor of Ortigas ownership of land being claimed by
Navarro and Widora.  This circumstance
makes them privies in law for purposes of the operation of the rule on
conclusiveness of judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it must be observed that Widora is bound by the
ruling laid down in the <u>Cia. Agricola</u> case of 1906 that Ortigas (through
its predecessor-in-interest) is the registered owner of land comprising the
Hacienda de Mandaloyon because the factual matters resolved in the <u>Navarro</u>
case show that the land covered by Widora's application forms part of that vast
tract of land adjudicated to Ortigas' predecessor-in-interest in the 1906
decision.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as held in the Court of Appeals decision which we
affirmed in G.R. No. 50156, the Torrens titles of Ortigas served as evidence of
its indefeasible title over the property covered thereby and they became
incontrovertible one year after entry of the final decree of registration from
which they were derived in 1906.<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
The Supreme Court's affirmance of this ruling in fact constitutes a<i> </i>holding
that the land covered by these titles (particularly TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653)
have been duly brought under the Torrens System of land registration and that
this circumstance prevented the land registration court hearing Widora's
application in LRC No. Q-336 from acquiring jurisdiction over the land covered
by that application.<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By way of background, this <u>Del Rosario</u> case originated as <u>Civil
Case No. 7-M(10339)</u> before Branch 15 of the CFI of Rizal.  In 1967, two (2) groups of occupants of the
disputed property, faced with final and executory judgments for ejectment obtained
by Ortigas, instituted this <u>Del Rosario</u> case as a class suit to impugn
the validity of Ortigas' Torrens titles.  The theory of the plaintiffs was that G.L.R.O. Record No. 917, and its
incidents, were void ab initio for alleged lack of notice of initial hearing,
among other reasons.  In a decision
dated 31 March 1970, Judge Vivencio Ruiz ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and
declared the Ortigas TCTs null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Del Rosario</u> case, Geodetic Engineer Carlos Angeles
again drew and offered in evidence a map indicating the full extent of the
Hacienda de Mandaloyon, based on plottings of the technical descriptions
appearing in the initial notice of hearing in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917, offered
and marked as Exhibit 43-A New Trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
Judge Alcantara noted that these plottings were quite adequate for the purpose
of identifying the land registered in Cia. Agricola's name in 1906:<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs [Del Rosario, et al.] also attempted to show as

polygon does not close such that one cannot give the exact area of the land
sought to be registered.  They claim
that the plan submitted by said Surveyor Carlos Angeles is 'doctored' because
it had a closed polygon.  In this
connection, it should be emphasized that the <u>Hacienda Mandaloyon is a vast
tract of land</u> having an area of 4,000 hectares <u>with natural boundaries
consisting of rivers and creeks as shown in the plan Exh. ‘43-A’ New Trial</u>.  Its natural boundaries are the Marikina
River, Pasig River, San Juan River, Diliman Creek and Estero de Buaya,
etc.  <u>Indeed, boundaries which are
natural and fixed such as creeks and rivers, not the area, should govern in
determining the identity of the land sought to be registered</u>.  And even conceding that the magnetic survey
employed in surveying the disputed property in 1904 was erroneous, yet 'mistake
in survey is not a ground for alteration of decree of registration.' <u>In fact</u>,
<u>plaintiffs</u>' [Del Rosario) <u>witness</u>, <u>Geodetic Engineer Pedro
Samson, readily admitted that the properties being claimed by them are inside
the area described in the notices</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
(Citations ommitted; underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit 43-A New Trial submitted in the <u>Del Rosario</u> case
showed the boundaries and location of the entire Hacienda Mandaloyon.   Annex P submitted in the present Widora case
shows the same entire Hacienda Mandaloyon and is identical with Exhibit 43-A
New Trial.  In the present Widora case,
Ortigas also submitted Annex K-1 to show the location and boundaries of the
land covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653.  When the map which is Annex K-1 is placed side by side with (or on top
of) the map of the whole Hacienda Mandaloyon which is Exhibit 43-A New Trial
and Annex P, <u>the Annex K-1 map coincides with a portion of the Exhibit 43-A
map</u>.  In other words, the lots
covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653 which are mapped in Annex K-1 constituted <u>a
portion of</u> the Hacienda Mandaloyon.  These Exhibits also show that the parcels of land covered by TCT Nos.
77652 and 77653 are located <u>west</u> of the Marikina river, which river was
established in <u>Del Rosario</u> to be the <u>eastern</u> natural boundary of
the Hacienda de Mandaloyon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, once more, it is apparent that the factual matters which
Widora seeks to litigate in G.R. No. 91797 have already been resolved in the <u>Del
Rosario</u> case.  Since the subject
matter of the controversy in <u>Del Rosario</u> and in G.R. No. 91797 are <u>identical</u>
(parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653), the cause of action of
Widora in G.R. No. 91797 is identical to that of the petitioners in <u>Del
Rosario</u>, i.e., the petitioners in Del Rosario contested Ortigas' claim of
ownership over the land from which they were being ejected, which is of course
the same claim of ownership embodied in Ortigas' opposition to Widora's land
registration application over the same land in the instant case.  It follows that Widora in G.R. No. 91797
must also be deemed privy in law of the petitioners in <u>Del Rosario</u> (for
they too assailed the validity of Decree No. 1425 and its particular
derivatives, TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653).  Accordingly, the factual and legal matters resolved with finality in the
<u>Del Rosario</u> case, which are determinative of the merits of Widora's
application for land registration in G.R. No. 91797 must be considered, as in
the <u>Navarro</u> case, as a bar to the grant of the Widora application under
the rule on conclusiveness of judgment.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VI.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another important element of Widora's claim being
asserted in the present proceedings which is precluded by <u>both the principle
of bar by prior judgment and the principle of conclusiveness of judgment</u>.  Widora's application for registration in the
present case (LRC No. Q-336), essentially rests on an alleged Spanish
title:  "<u>Titulo de Propiedad No.
4136</u>," dated 25 April 1894, said to be issued in the name of one
Mariano San Pedro y Esteban, supposedly covering land of unimaginably large
proportions:  <u>173,000 hectares</u> in
Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Rizal, Quezon City, Caloocan City and Pasay City.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Back in 10 December 1976, or only two (2) years after Widora had
filed LRC No. Q-336, one Justino Benito and Widora commenced another case,
Civil Case No. Q-22410 before the CFI of Quezon City.  Benito claimed there that he was co-administrator of the
intestate estate of Don Mariano San Pedro y Esteban, and that part of this
estate was land covered by the supposed Spanish title, including a piece of
land situated in Ugong Norte, Pasig and Bagumbayan, Quezon City, which land was
covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653 issued in Ortigas' name.  Benito and Widora, therefore, sought in
Q-22410 to annul those TCTs for covering land allegedly previously owned by the

<p class="BODY">Ortigas moved to dismiss the Benito-Widora complaint, arguing <u>inter
alia</u>, that the alleged Spanish title relied upon by Benito and Widora had
already been divested of probative value as evidence of land ownership, by P.D.
No. 892.  Ortigas' motion to dismiss was
sustained on that ground by the trial court in a<i> </i>decision dated 28
February 1978.<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That decision of the trial court in Q-22410 was affirmed on
appeal by the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. No. CV-64424 in a decision written
by Jurado, <u>J</u>., dated 31 May 1984.  The Court of Appeals, thus, affirmed the trial court's ruling that the
Spanish title relied upon by Benito and Widora was no longer any good.<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Widora (but not Benito) went on a <span style="color: windowtext;">Petition</span>
for Review before the Supreme Court, in G.R. No. 69343.  This Court affirmed the decision of the
Court of Appeals in a minute resolution dated 6 February 1985.  Entry of final judgment was made on 29 March
1985.<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As noted, <u>in the case at bar, Widora is relying upon the same
supposed Spanish title</u> - <u>Titulo de Propiedad No. 4136</u>.  We believe and so hold that <u>the
Resolution of this Court in G.R. No. 69343, holding that that alleged Spanish
title had become bereft of any probative value is res adjudicata in respect of
the present case</u>.  Put a little
differently, the principle of bar by prior judgment precludes any reliance by
Widora in the case at bar on that fantastic Spanish title considering the
essential identities of parties and identity of subject matter and of cause of
action between Civil Case No. Q-22410 and LRC Case No. Q-336.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We should add that Widora's prayer for alternative relief in the
form of confirmation of imperfect title over the land covered by its
application for registration, is immaterial.  That alternative relief is also premised upon Widora's claim that
Ortigas had fraudulently registered the land in its (Ortigas) own name such
that the land remained presumptively public land.  The firmly entrenched rule is that a party can not evade the
application of the principle of bar by prior judgment by simply varying the
form of the action or by adopting a different mode of presenting its case.<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VII.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We consider finally the question of whether or not the defense of
<u>res</u> <u>adjudicata</u> has been waived by Ortigas by failure to plead
that defense seasonably in its opposition or motion to dismiss in LRC No.
Q-336.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe and so hold that there was no such waiver of <u>res</u>
<u>adjudicata</u> by Ortigas in the case at bar.  It is most important to note, in the first place, that the
defense of <u>res</u> <u>adjudicata</u> pleaded by Ortigas in this case relates
ultimately to the <u>jurisdiction of the land registration court to try LRC No.
Q-336</u>.  The Court of Appeals
correctly stressed that Ortigas having shown that the land applied for by
Widora is already registered in Ortigas' name, the land registration court
simply had no jurisdiction to decree the registration of that same land in the
name of some other person.  The
well-established rule is that lack of jurisdiction which renders an action
dismissible may be determined by the court seized with it <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u>,
and may be raised by a party, at any stage of the proceedings even on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With particular reference to the ruling that Widora's alleged <u>Titulo
de Propiedad No. 4136</u> was bereft of probative value, we note that the <u>Benito-Widora</u>
case reached finality (in the Supreme Court) only in 1985, when the proceedings
in the motion to dismiss filed by Ortigas in LRC No. Q-336 were already in an
advanced stage.<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, the Resolutions of the Supreme Court in the <u>Navarro
</u>and <u>Del Rosario</u> cases, disposed of those cases <u>on their merits</u>
by affirming the pertinent decisions of the Court of Appeals.  Those Resolutions are part of the case law
and the records of this Court itself of which we are bound to take judicial
notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a>
We are certainly not at liberty to disregard them in any case.  So to disregard our own decisions would be
to inflict substantial injustice and irreparable injury upon Ortigas which
would be compelled to do all over again what it had done at least twice before ­--to
prove it has indefeasible title to the land covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and
77653.  The resulting injustice and
injury would not be limited to Ortigas, but would engulf many thousands of
present registered private owners of Transfer Certificates of Title covering
the thousands of hectares of land embraced by Decree No. 1425.  The grave social implications of permitting
a cloud to arise on all those Transfer Certificates of Title by our failure to
take into account our own decisions in earlier cases, can scarcely be
contemplated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third place, waiver of <u>res</u> <u>adjudicata,</u>
certainly in cases like the one before us, cannot casually be assumed to have
been made.  What is involved here is not
an academic doctrine of law but very valuable property rights, so valuable that
at least thrice before, various persons or groups of persons (including Widora,
for the second time) have attempted to usurp title thereto by assailing the
same two (2) TCTs.  Ortigas tenaciously
fought off those efforts at least three (3) times before, from the trial court
thru the Court of Appeals to our own Court, each litigation stretching out to
many years.  In this situation, only the
most explicit and deliberate statement, in unmistakable language; will suffice
to constitute waiver; that is certainly not present here.  What is claimed here is merely implied or
presumed waiver, which has been expressly denied by Ortigas.  Yet as Lantin, <u>J</u>. of the respondent
Court of Appeals observed, as far back as 27 June 1979, in its motion for
reconsideration of the trial court's order of 20 April 1979 denying its motion
to dismiss, Ortigas had already brought to the attention of the trial court the
fact that its assailed titles had been upheld by Courts of First Instance and
appellate courts in prior cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, during the proceedings on Ortigas' motion to dismiss, <u>the
Government itself, through the Land Registration Commission, had advised the
trial court that the 156 hectare parcel Widora was seeking to register were
"covered by valid and subsisting titles in the name of Ortigas</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the record of the instant case shows that Ortigas
pleaded as a special and affirmative defense bar by prior judgment in its very
first Opposition dated 13 October 1978 to Widora's application in LRC Q-336.<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a>
That defense was elaborated by Ortigas in its motion to dismiss dated 23
October 1978, where it stressed that the land applied for was already
registered in its name under the Torrens system and that such previous
registration of its title amounts to <u>res</u> <u>adjudicata</u> binding upon
the whole world.<a style="" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></span></span></a>
During the protracted hearings on its motion to dismiss before the trial court,
Ortigas specifically pleaded our decision in the <u>Benito-Widora</u> case
which by then had attained finality, in a Memorandum dated 28 October 1986 as a
bar to further proceedings in the case at bar.  In its motion for reconsideration of the trial court's order denying the
motion to dismiss, Ortigas again specifically pleaded the <u>Benito-Widora</u>
case, as well as the <u>Compania Agricola</u> case to show that its registered
title over the disputed land had become indefeasible.<a style="" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></span></span></a>
Further, Ortigas specifically pleaded not only the <u>Compania Agricola</u> and
the <u>Benito-Widora</u> cases but also the decisions in the <u>Navarro</u>, <u>Del
Rosario</u> and <u>Ruiz</u> cases in its petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> before the Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></span></span></a>
We accordingly find it extremely difficult to suppose that there was implied or
presumed waiver here of the defense of <u>res</u> <u>adjudicata</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

The newly discovered evidence consisted of certified true copies of the 1904
issues of the Manila American and La Democracia newspapers containing the
notice of initial hearing in G.L.R.O. Record No. 917.  This evidence was offered to rebut the holding in the Ruiz
decision that the land registration court hearing G.L.R.O. Record No. 917
failed to acquire jurisdiction over the land subject matter of Cia. Agricola's application
for lack of publication of the initial notice of hearing.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">By happenstance, Ortigas received
information that the Library of the U.S. Congress in Washington, D.C. might
have the newspaper issues containing the publication of the notice of hearing
of G.L.R.O. Case No. 917.  The information
proved correct and Ortigas secured the certified true copies from Washington,
D.C. (Decision in C.A.-G.R. No. SP 00039, pp. 10A, 21A-32A).</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BIDIN, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">With due respect, I find it difficult to agree with the ponencia
written by my esteemed colleague, Mr. Justice Florentino Feliciano.</p>

<p class="BODY">In disposing of the controversy before us, the Court resolved the
issue on the basis of facts which are not extant in the records of the case (GR
No. 97197).  This is quite
unprecedented.</p>

<p class="BODY">Invoking the concept of judicial notice, the Court considered
certain facts which led it to rule in favor of respondent Ortigas.  I submit that these "facts"
substantial as they are, should not have been considered by the Court for the
simple reason that they were not even alleged by respondent itself nor do they
appear on the records before us.  In so
doing, it is my submission that the Court over-stretched the concept of
judicial notice.  The immutable rule on
burden of proof is that each party must prove his own affirmative allegations
(Sec. 1, Rule 131) by the amount of evidence required by law which is
preponderance of evidence in civil cases.  That is why the decision sought to be reconsidered, remanded the case to
the trial court for further proceedings.  At the risk of being repetitious, I would like to emphasize that the
facts narrated in the Resolution were gathered substantially from sources
outside of the records of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its motion for reconsideration, respondent Ortigas contends,
among others, that the petition filed by Widows and Orphans is already barred
by res judicata; that the origin of TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653 has been correctly
identified by the Court of Appeals as OCT 351, notwithstanding the fact that
the said TCTs themselves show on their faces that they have been derived from
OCT Nos. 19, 334, 336 and 337.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, as to the defense of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>.  At the outset, it is significant to note
that respondent Ortigas did not set up or raise the doctrine of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
anent the existence of previous cases involving the same parties (Widora v.
Court of Appeals, GR No. 69343 and Del Rosario v. Ortigas &amp; Co., GR No. 66110)
either in its Comment to the petition, in its memorandum or in its motion for
reconsideration.  In said pleadings,
respondent merely alleged that the trial court has no jurisdiction over LRC
Case No. Q-336 simply because the land applied for is alleged to have been
already decreed and titled in its name and cannot be decreed a second time
(Rollo, pp. 101 &amp; 194).  They were
bare recitals of general principles applicable to land registration cases with
respect to indefeasibility of certificates of titles, made without the benefit
of any discussion regarding the application thereof to the case at bar nor was
there any reference made to any case (now being relied upon) as constitutive of
<u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the existence of the said cases does not appear to have
been raised in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> or put in issue before respondent
Court of Appeals (as in fact it was not even considered by the Court of Appeals
in the appealed decision).  Before this
Court, respondent Ortigas chose to maintain its silence in raising the defense
of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> and did so only after an adverse decision was
rendered.  Furthermore, it was not even
raised in its motion for reconsideration but only in its memorandum submitted
after the hearing on said motion.  Such
being the case, I do not think this Court is at liberty to cull evidence not
borne by the records and in the process go beyond what appears in the
pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is my considered opinion that the defense of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
must be seasonably pleaded in order to be valid, (Fernandez v. de Castro, 48
Phil 123 [1925]; see also Del Val v. Del Val, 29 Phil 534 [1915]) and if not
set up as a defense or ground of objection seasonably, the doctrine of <u>res</u>
<u>judicata</u> is deemed waived (Alvarez v. Court of Appeals, 158 SCRA 401
[1988]; Vergara v. Rugue, 78 SCRA 312 [1977]; Phil. Coal Miners’ Assn. v. Cebu
Portland Cement, 10 SCRA 784 [1964]).  Where <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> was raised as a defense only in the
motion for reconsideration, the same was deemed waived (Pulido v. Pablo, 117
SCRA 16 [1982]).   Here, respondent
raised the defense of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> only in its memorandum
submitted <u>after</u> filing its motion for reconsideration of the decision
dated August 28, 1991, which motion, as stated earlier, did not even contain
any reference to the cases now belatedly set up as a defense by respondent in
its memorandum in support of its motion for reconsideration.  Respondent's invocation of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
having been made too late in the day, the same must be considered as having
been waived (Sec. 8, Rule 15 and Sec. 5, Rule 16).</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, a perusal of the cases belatedly relied upon by
respondent as defense (<u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>) would readily disclose that
OCT 351, the alleged origin of TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653, was not the subject
matter of said cases much less passed upon in the disposition of said
cases.  The issue of the applicability
of OCT 351 to the case at bar is even more compounded by the fact that TCT Nos.
776752 and 77653 do not, on their faces, reflect that their origin is OCT 351
as claimed by respondent.  On the
contrary, said TCTs trace their origin to OCT Nos. 19, 334, 336 and 337 and
hence, not to OCT 351.  Otherwise
stated, Ortigas’ evidence (TCTs 77652 and 77653) do not support its contention
that the said TCTs were derivatives of OCT 351.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opines, however, that this Court has already given
its imprimatur to the claim of Ortigas that the identity of the disputed parcel
of land has already been decided as far back in 1906 in the case of Cia.
Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo (6 Phil. 246) and later in Ortigas v. Ruiz (148
SCRA 326 [1987]).  Examining said cases,
I see no clear and definite technical description of the contested land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ortigas v. Ruiz (<u>supra</u>) involves a parcel of land covered
by TCT No. 227758 with an area of 162 hectares located in Pasig, Rizal.  There is no identity of subject matter
between Otigas v. Ruiz and the instant case.  They refer to different parcels of land covered by different transfer
certificates of title.  On the other
hand, the 1906 case of Ultramar v. Domingo (<u>supra</u>) involves a parcel of
land known as "Hacienda de Mandaluyon" without any specification as
to its location, area and boundaries.  Hence, it cannot be said that the parcel of land applied for in this
case is identical with the lots covered by Ortigas title.  As stated in the decision sought to be
reconsidered, Decree 1425 (alleged by Ortigas to embrace the lots covered by
its TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653), covers a 17-hectare lot located at Sta. Ana,
Manila, while the lot applied for is alienable and disposable as certified by
the Bureau of Lands and by the Bureau of Forestry and has an area of 156
hectares located in Quezon City four (4) kilometers away from Sta. Ana, Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent next argues that the Court of Appeals committed no
error in admitting as evidence OCT 351 on the ground that Sec. 47 of Act 496
itself declares it to be admissible in all courts.  Said Section provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 47.  The original
certificate in the registration book, any copy thereof duly certified under the
signature of the clerk, or of the register of deeds of the province or the city
where the land is situated and the seal of the court, and also the owner's
duplicate certificate <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>received</u> <u>as</u> <u>evidence</u>
<u>in</u> <u>all</u> <u>courts</u> of the Philippine Islands <u>and</u> <u>shall</u>
<u>be</u> <u>conclusive</u> <u>as</u> <u>to</u> <u>all</u> <u>matters</u> <u>contained</u>
<u>therein</u> except so far as otherwise provided in this Act."
(underscoring supplied)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Following the line of respondent's argument, OCT 351 should not
have been admitted and/or considered as proof that TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653
were derived from it (OCT 351).  This is
because the said TCTs themselves show that they were derived <u>not</u> from
OCT 351 but from other OCTs stated above.  To admit OCT 351 as the supposed origin of TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653 at
this stage of the proceeding would in effect be disregarding the official
entries made therein which indicate that said TCTs were derivatives of OCT Nos.
19, 334, 336 &amp; 337.  These entries
are conclusive, so the law says.  Consequently, Ortigas’ contention that TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653 are
derivatives of OCT 351 has no leg to stand on.</p>

<p class="BODY">The procedure adopted by the respondent Court of Appeals in
arriving at its conclusion that TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653 were derived from OCT
351 contrary to what is stated in the faces of said TCTs, finds no support in
law as it amounted to a correction and/or alteration of the TCTs in violation
of the existing applicable law.  Under
the Sec. 112 of Act 496 (now Sec. 108 of PD 1529), no certificate of title may
be amended or altered except by order of the proper regional trial court.  The petition for the purpose must be filed
before the regional trial court, sitting as a land registration court, and
entitled in the original case in which the decree of registration was entered.  Certainly, the Court of Appeals, in a <i>certiorari</i>
and injunction proceeding, cannot arrogate unto itself that power lodged
exclusively with the land registration court without running afoul with the
said provision of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, this Court sustained the findings of respondent
court.  Thus giving judicial assent to
the illegal assumption of jurisdiction by the respondent Court of Appeals in
the amendment or alteration of TCTs contrary to the procedure which the law has
explicitly provided.  In effect, and by
virtue of this Court's Resolution, we assumed the functions of a trial court
and a land registration court at the same time.  This, I believe, should not be done.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ortigas also questions the ruling of this Court which considers
the plan submitted as well as the testimony of its surveyor as secondary
evidence to prove the contents of Decree 1425.  However, what was submitted by Ortigas as the survey plan of the land
and attached to its memorandum as an annex is actually a location map prepared
by its own surveyor in 1972 or 67 years after its alleged registration and <u>not</u>
<u>the</u> <u>blueprint</u> <u>copy</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>original</u> <u>survey</u>
<u>plan</u>, <u>showing</u> <u>the</u> <u>sketch</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>technical</u>
<u>description</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>lot</u> <u>applied</u> <u>for</u> <u>approved</u>
<u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Director</u> <u>of</u> <u>Lands</u>.  Hence, a secondary evidence of doubtful
competency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ortigas further assails the ruling of this Court to the effect
that the issue of whether the land applied is a registered land as contended by
it or a public land as certified by the Bureau of Lands and the Bureau of
Forestry calls for a full-blown trial before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue in this case is whether the 156-hectare parcel of land
applied for, located at Ugong Norte, Quezon City, is covered by Ortigas' TCT
Nos. 77652 and 77653, or is alienable and disposable land as contended by
petitioner and certified by the Bureau of Lands and the Bureau of
Forestry.  These are questions of facts
and questions of facts are beyond the province of this Court (PLDT v. National
Telecommunications commission, 190 SCRA 717 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier, the correction of the entries in the transfer
certificates of title should be effected before the Regional Trial Court
sitting as a land registration court which has original jurisdiction over the
same pursuant to Sec. 112 of Act 496 (now Sec. 108, PD 1529).  For as long as these entries appear in the
transfer certificates of title, they are binding and conclusive upon the court
(Sec. 47, Act. 496).  Otherwise stated,
these entries, until ascertained to be erroneous in an appropriate proceeding
before the land registration court, are binding and conclusive in all courts
including the respondent Court of Appeals and this Court.  Inasmuch as Ortigas insists that the subject
parcel of land is covered by OCT 351 under Decree 1425, while its own Transfer
Certificate of Title Nos. 77652 and 77653 state that they are derivatives of
OCT Nos. 19, 334, 336 and 337, it follows that Transfer Certificates of Title
Nos. 77652 and 77653 do not embrace the subject parcel of land, not being
derivatives of OCT 351.  The entries in
the TCTs of Ortigas cannot be dismissed as mere errors since the said entries
are conclusive.  Hence, the necesity of
remanding the case to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for resolution of the
factual issues in the exercise of its original jurisdiction.  Neither this Court nor the respondent Court
of Appeals can initially make the correction, if there be any.</p>

<p class="BODY">But what is more disturbing is the fact that the ponencia based
its decision on evidenciary facts not borne out by the records.  The ponencia made a number of referrences to
the records had in the Court of Appeals which, unfortunately, does not appear
on the records presented before this Court for resolution.  This, I believe, amounted to over-extending
the concept of judicial notice.  I
submit that it is not the duty of this Court to supply what the party litigants
have failed to present.  Otherwise, this
Court might as well sit as a trier of facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing considerations, I vote to DENY the
motion for reconsideration.</p>
