<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded “not guilty.” The facts, as
found by the trial court, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“The evidence of the prosecution show that on May 9, 1988, around
5:30 in the afternoon, deceased <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ramil</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>,
Rudy <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span>
and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> were gathered in front of the store
of Spouses Raul <span class="SpellE">Tagala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Telly</span>

and listening to <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>,
who was then sitting on a stool with his back towards the provincial road,
narrating about his fighting cocks, when Edwin <span class="SpellE">Mabubay</span>,
coming from the feeder road going towards the provincial road slowly approached
deceased <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> from
the back, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">suddenly placed his right
hand around his neck, pulled his knife from his left waist and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> on the left breast
with his left hand.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“As narrated by witness Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span>,
this is how accused stabbed deceased <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>:</blockquote>

then from behind him came the accused Edwin <span class="SpellE">Mabubay</span>
represented by the witness suddenly placed his right hand around the neck of
the victim simultaneously with his left hand and pulled out a knife from his
left side then stabbed the victim in his left breast).</blockquote>

<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Only once.</blockquote>

the accused is a left-handed person?</blockquote>

<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>

be left handed?</blockquote>

 31, 1988</st1:date>, MVQ.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> and all his companions were
all shocked by what they have seen and they all stood up to help deceased <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> but when Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> went near <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> to help him, accused Edwin <span class="SpellE">Mabubay</span>
told him:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘Do not intervene <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or interfere because you have nothing to do
with this,’ at the same time accused was holding the knife he used at a 45
degree angle while retreating backward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As soon as accused had retreated and walked towards the provincial road,
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span>, Raul <span class="SpellE">Tagala</span>
and their companions rushed to help <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> but upon seeing that blood was spurting from the wound
of deceased, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> ran to get his tricycle in
order to load him and bring him to the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the way to the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">hospital, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> passed
by the house of a certain Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cawaling</span>, a
brother-in-law of the deceased, and because Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cawaling</span>
has a jeep and would be a faster vehicle to bring the deceased to the hospital,
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span> stopped by the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cawaling</span> and informed him that <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Raz</span> was seriously wounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cawaling</span>
immediately changed his shirt and instructed them to load <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Raz</span> inside his jeep in order that he can be
immediately brought to the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, however, deceased <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> died before reaching the hospital.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="SpellE">Telly</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagala</span>,
wife of Raul <span class="SpellE">Tagala</span>, owner of the store where the
stabbing incident had occurred, testified in Court and corroborated the
testimony of eyewitness Romeo <span class="SpellE">Leyson</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified that <span class="GramE">she was</span>
very sure that there was no altercation between the accused and the victim nor
did the victim ever offer accused a glass of tuba to drink before the stabbing
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What she saw was that accused,
<span class="GramE">who</span> came from behind deceased, put his right hand
around the shoulder of deceased <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> and stabbed him with his left hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In his defense, accused Edwin <span class="SpellE">Mabubay</span>
testified that on May 9, 1988, he was on his way to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dongon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Numancia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, to plow his <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> with
a tractor but he was not able to reach <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Dongon</span> because at the store of Raul <span class="SpellE">Tagala</span>
situated beside the provincial road of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Bubog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Numancia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> stopped him and offered him a glass of tuba.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He accepted the glass of tuba but only drunk
one-half and poured the other half to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> got angry with him and told him:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘<span class="SpellE">Gago</span>, <span class="SpellE">anong</span> gusto mo?’ (You fool, what do you want?).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span>, who was then seated in a stool, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">seemed to stand up, accused immediately
placed his arm around his shoulders and stabbed him with his left hand.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1988</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered judgment finding the accused, Edwin <span class="SpellE">Mabubay</span>, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
murder and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of “Thirty (30) Years of
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>; to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Dioleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> the sum of P30<span class="GramE">,000</span>; and to pay the costs” (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellant alleges that the trial court erred in
convicting him of murder despite the absence of treachery in the killing of the
victim which occurred after the latter called him “<span class="SpellE">gago</span>”
for drinking only half of a glass of tuba (that the deceased gave him) and
throwing out the rest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery, “the 16th aggravating circumstance, exists when the
offender commits any of the crimes against the person, employing means,
methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to
insure its execution, without risk to himself arising from any defense which
the offended party might make” (Art. 14, par. 16, p. 386, Revised Penal Code by
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Vol. <span class="GramE">I, 1987 Ed.).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">To constitute treachery, two conditions must be present, to
wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the employment of means of
execution that give the person attacked no opportunity to defend himself or to
retaliate; and (2) the means of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">execution
were deliberately or consciously adopted (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>,
64 SCRA 319).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that the appellant’s attack against <span class="SpellE">Raz</span> was surreptitious for he grabbed the victim from
behind, encircled his right arm around the latter’s neck, and stabbed him with
the knife in his left hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These acts
tended directly and especially to insure the execution of the killing without
danger and risk to the appellant arising from any attempt that the victim might
make to defend himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General pointed out that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“<span class="SpellE"><u>Alevosia</u></span> or
treachery is present because the attack from behind was so sudden and
unexpected that the deceased did not have the opportunity to defend himself and
there was no risk to the assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. Lopez, 80 SCRA 18; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>,

<p class="BODY">The penalty (30 years of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>)
