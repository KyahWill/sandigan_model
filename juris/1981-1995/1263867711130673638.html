at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30</st1:time> in the afternoon, John
Ventura was conversing with several persons on a culvert when appellant <span class="GramE">arrived</span> riding on a bicycle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He approached John Ventura and forthwith, drew a gun from his waistline,
pointed the same to <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
uttering at the same time:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘<span class="SpellE">Agka</span> <span class="SpellE">mibabali</span> pare’ (Don't
interfere, pare!).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
instinctively ran towards his house, but appellant chased him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He caught up with <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
<span style="">in </span>the latter's yard, about 8
meters away from the culvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There,
appellant shot <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="1">Jan. 12, 1988</st1:date>, pp. 5-8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim fell and sprawled on the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant tried to reload the
gun still pointed at the victim, but the latter's sister, Corazon Ventura <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, who was at that time only about 1 1/2 meters
away from appellant, grabbed and succeeded in taking possession of the gun from
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">She </span>witnessed the whole incident from the time appellant chased
the victim up to the time he shot him (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid, pp.
11-12).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A certain Daniel <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>, the victim's
brother-in-law, upon hearing the gun report followed by screams and shouts from
the people, immediately left his house which was about 40 to 50 meters away and
ran towards the place of the commotion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He saw Corazon Ventura- <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> wrest the
gun from appellant (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>,
<st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="1">Jan. 7, 1988</st1:date>, p. 35).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When appellant saw Daniel <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>,
he immediately ran away, while Corazon handed the gun to him (Daniel <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>) telling him to surrender it to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hired <span style="">a </span>tricycle and brought <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along the way, they
first stopped at the police station to surrender the gun to the
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim died on the way
to the hospital (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Ibid, pp. 39-41).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant, however, denied that he shot the deceased John
Ventura.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also denied that the gun
belonged <span style="">to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version of the incident, as summarized by
his counsel, </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Accused on his behalf, testified that on <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1987</st1:date> while repairing his bicycle <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of their house he saw the victim, John Ventura at
the top of the culvert together with <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span style="">Bravo, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span> and <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he
boarded his bicycle and went near John Ventura.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching the </span>place, <span style="">he
told John </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Ventura</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> '<span class="SpellE">Agka</span> <span class="SpellE">Mibabali</span> Pare'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
after he uttered the words, John <span class="SpellE">Ventuta</span> immediately
ran towards their house which is about seven to eight meters away from the
culvert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That John Ventura entered their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Daniel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
followed him because he wants (sic) to talk to him as John Ventura was
interfering to </span><span style="">(sic) </span><span style="">his debtors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Daniel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> was
not able to follow him inside their house for in </span>a <span style="">matter of second John Ventura came out from
their house carrying a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Daniel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> immediately grabbed the right hand of John Ventura to
</span>wrest <span style="">possession of the gun;
however, in the process of grappling for possession of the gun it went off

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused-appellant, through his counsel, insists
that he is innocent and assails the trial court for giving credence to the
"absurd and fascinatingly incredible" and biased testimony of the
prosecution witnesses who are close relatives of the deceased; and in not
believing his version which is corroborated by <span style="">two (2) </span>disinterested witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have gone over the record of this case with pain­staking care
and find no merit in the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court found the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses to be credible
and <span style="">we </span>find no reason to disturb
the findings of <span style="">the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record of this case is bereft of any
circumstance from which we may infer that the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses are mere concoctions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
are sufficient facts on which said witnesses based their positive
identification of the appellant as the owner of the </span>gun used by him in
killing John Ventura.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>
declared that he was one <span style="">of </span>those
persons chatting with John Ventura when the appellant arrived and told the said
John Ventura:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Agka</span>
<span class="SpellE">mibabali</span> pare" (meaning, Do not interfere pare)
and then drew a gun tucked <span style="">in his </span>waist
and pointed it at John Ventura who ran away <span style="">pursued by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
positive that the gun belonged to the appellant because he saw the same gun in
appellant's possession the night before the incident.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Corazon Ventura-<span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, for her
part, declared that she was also among those conversing with John Ventura when
the appellant arrived and drew a gun from his waist which he pointed at John
Ventura saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Do not interfere
pare." She saw John Ventura running home, followed by the appellant who
shot him; and that when the appellant tried to re-load the gun, she wrested the
gun from the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She gave the gun
to Daniel <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>, who had arrived in the meantime,
with instructions <span style="">to </span>surrender it
to the p<span style="">olice.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Daniel <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>, an

<p class="BODY">The mere fact that the prosecution witnesses Daniel <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span> and Corazon Ventura-<span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
are closely related to the deceased is not a sufficient reason to disregard
their testimonies since they had no improper motive to testify falsely against
the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relationship of the
witnesses to the victim does not render the clear and positive testimonies of
said witnesses less worthy of full faith and credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The declarations of interested witnesses are
not necessarily biased and incredible.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistency in the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses, pointed out by the appellant in his Brief, i.e., that <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span> declared that
upon hearing <span style="">a gun shot, </span><span style="">he w</span>ent <span style="">out of his house which is less than </span>10 <span style="">meters </span>from <span style="">the house of
John Ventura where the shooting </span>took <span style="">place and saw the said John Ventura sprawled on the ground and the
appellant w</span><span style="">as </span><span style="">no longer there,
whereas, Daniel <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>, who lived about 40 to 50
meters away from the house of John Ventura stated that upon </span>hearing the
gun <span style="">shot, he ran to the direction from
where the gun shot came and saw his sister-in</span>-law<span style=""> Corazon Ventura-<span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> grappling with
the appellant for the possession of the gun, is in the nature of a minor
detail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not affect the integrity
of the witnesses' testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It </span><span style="">is well-settled that inconsistencies on minor details do not affect
credibility as they refer only to collateral matters which do not touch upon
the commission of the crime itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the issue is one of credibility of <span style="">witnesses and it is a settled rule that
findings of fact of trial courts which heard the witnesses and assessed their
credibility are not to be disturbed on appeal where there is no abuse of
discretion imputed to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein
appellant failed to demonstrate that his case falls within the exception that
