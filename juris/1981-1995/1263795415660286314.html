<p>Savings Account No. 010-5878868-D of Isabela Wood Construction &amp; 
Development Corporation, opened with the Philippine National Bank on March 9, 
1979 in the amount of P2 million, is the subject of two (2) conflicting claims, 
sought to be definitively resolved in the proceedings at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> One claim is asserted by the ACEROS — 
Gloria G. <em>Vda. de</em> Ong Acero, Arnolfo Ong Acero and Soledad Ong 
Acero-Chua, judgment creditors of the depositor (hereafter simply referred to as 
ISABELA) — who seek to enforce against said savings account the final and 
executory judgment rendered in their favor by the Court of First Instance of 
Rizal (QC Br. XVI).&nbsp; The other claim has been put forth by the Philippine 
National Bank (hereafter, simply PNB) which claims that since ISABELA was at 
some point in time both its debtor and creditor — ISABELA's deposit being deemed 
a loan to it (PNB) — there had occurred a mutual set-off between them, which 
effectively precluded the ACEROS' recourse to that deposit.<br><br>The 
controversy was decided by the Intermediate Appellate Court adversely to the 
PNB.&nbsp; It is this decision that the PNB would have this Court reverse.<br><br>The 
ACEROS' claim to the bank deposit is more specifically founded upon the 
garnishment thereof by the sheriff, effected in execution of the partial 
judgment rendered by the CFI at Quezon City in their favor on November 18, 
1979.&nbsp; The partial judgment ordered payment by ISABELA to the ACEROS of the 
amount of P1,532,000.07.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Notice of 
garnishment was served on the PNB on January 9, 1980, pursuant to the writ of 
execution dated December 23, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
This was followed by an Order issued on February 15, 1980 directing PNB to hand 
over this amount of P1,532,000.07 to the sheriff for delivery, in turn, to the 
ACEROS.&nbsp; Not quite two months later, or on April 8, 1980, a second (and the 
final and complete judgment) was promulgated by the CFI in favor of the ACEROS 
and against ISABELA, the dispositive part of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of 
plaintiffs and against the defendant:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>Reiterating the dispositive portion of the partial judgment issued by this 
Court, dated November 16, 1979, ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff 
the amount of P1,532,000.07 as principal, with interest at 12% per annum from 
December 11, 1975 until the whole amount is fully paid;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendant to pay the plaintiffs the amount of P207,148.00 as 
compensatory damages, with legal interest thereon from the filing of the 
complaint until the whole amount is fully paid;<br><br></li><li>Ordering defendant to pay plaintiffs the amount of P383,000.00 as and by way 
of attorney's fees."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br></li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, PNB's claim to the two-million-peso deposit in question is 
made to rest on an agreement between it and ISABELA in virtue of which, 
according to PNB:&nbsp; (1) the deposit was made by ISABELA as "collateral" in 
connection with its indebtedness to PNB as to which it (ISABELA) had assumed 
certain contractual undertakings; and (2) in the event of ISABELA's failure to 
fulfill those undertakings, PNB was empowered to apply the deposit to the 
payment of that indebtedness.&nbsp; The facts upon which PNB's theory stands are 
summarized in the Order of CFI Judge Solano dated October 1, 1982,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> relevant portions of which are here 
reproduced: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "On October 13, 1977, Isabela Wood Construction and Development 
Corporation ** entered into a Credit Agreement with PNB.&nbsp; Under the agreement 
PNB, having approved the application of defendant (Isabela &amp; c.) for the 
establishment for its account of a deferred letter of credit in the amount of DM 
4,695,947.00 in favor of the Machinenfabrik Augsburg Nunberg (MAN) of Germany 
from whom defendant purchased thirty-five (35) units of MAN trucks, defendant 
corporation agreed to put up, as collaterals, among others, the 
following:<br><br>‘4.&nbsp; The CLIENT shall assign to the BANK the proceeds of its 
contract with the Department of Public Works for the construction of Nagapit 
Suspension Bridge (Substructure) in Cagayan.’<br><br>This particular proviso in 
the aforesaid agreement was to be subsequently confirmed by Faustino Dy, Jr., as 
president of defendant corporation, in a letter to the PNB, dated February 21, 
1970, quoted in full as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Gentlemen:<br><br>This is to confirm our arrangement that the treasury 
warrant in the amount of P2,704 million in favor of Isabela Wood Construction 
and Development Corporation to be delivered either by the Commission on Audit or 
the Ministry of Public Highways, shall be placed in a savings account with your 
bank to the extent of P2 million.<br><br>'The said amount shall remain in the 
savings account until we are able to comply with the delivery and registration 
of the mortgage in favor of the Philippine National Bank of our Parañaque 
property, and the securing from Metropolitan Bank and Home Owners Savings and 
Loan Association to allow PNB a second mortgage on the properties of Isabela 
Wood Construction Group, Inc., presently under first mortgage with them.'</p>
<p>Thus, on March 9, 1970, pursuant to paragraph 4 of the Credit Agreement, 
pursuant to paragraph 4 of the Credit Agreement quoted above, PNB thru its 
International Department opened the savings account in question, under Account 
No. 010-58768-D, with an initial deposit of P2,000,000.00, proceeds of a 
treasury warrant delivered to PNB (EXHIBIT 3-A). 
<br></p></blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote><br>Since defendant corporation failed to deliver to PNB by way of 
mortgage its Parañaque property, neither was defendant corporation able to 
secure from Metropolitan Bank and Home Owners Savings and Loan Association its 
consent to allow PNB a second mortgage, and considering that the obligation of 
defendant corporation to PNB have been due and unsettled PNB applied the amount 
of P2,102804.11 in defendant's savings account of PNB."
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>It was upon this version of the facts, and its theory thereon based of a 
mutual set-off, or compensation, between it and ISABELA — in accordance with 
Articles 1278 et seq of the Civil Code — that PNB intervened in the action 
between the ACEROS and ISABELA on or about February 28, 1980 and moved for 
reconsideration of the Order of February 15, 1980 (requiring it to turn over to 
the sheriff the sum of P1,532,000.07, <em><em>supra</em></em>:&nbsp; fn. 2).&nbsp; But its 
motion met with no success.&nbsp; It was denied by the Lower Court (Hon. Judge 
Apostol, presiding) by Order dated May 14, 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> And a motion for the reconsideration of 
that Order of May 14, 1980 was also denied, by Order dated August 11, 
1980.<br><br>PNB again moved for reconsideration, this time of the Order of 
August 11, 1980; it also pleaded for suspension in the meantime of the 
enforcement of the Orders of February 15, and May 14, 1980.&nbsp; Its persistence 
seemingly paid off.&nbsp; For the Trial Court (now presided over by Hon. Judge 
Solano), directed on October 9, 1980 the setting aside of said Orders of May 14, 
and August 11, 1980, and set for hearing PNB's first motion for the 
reconsideration of the Order of February 15, 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Several months afterwards, or more 
precisely on October 1, 1982, the Order of February 15, 1980 was itself also 
struck down,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the Lower Court opining 
that under the circumstances, there had been a valid assignment by ISABELA to 
PNB of the amount deposited, which effectively placed that amount beyond the 
reach of the ACEROS, viz:</p>
<blockquote>"When the two million or so treasury warrant, proceeds of 
defendant's contract with the government was delivered to PNB, said amount, per 
agreement aforequoted, had already been assigned by defendant corporation to 
PNB, as collateral.<br><br>The said amount is not a pledge.<br><br>The 
assignment is valid.&nbsp; The defendant need not be the owner thereof at the time of 
assignment.<br><br>'An assignment of credit and other incorporeal rights shall 
be perfected in accordance with the provisions of Article 1475.<br><br>'The 
contract of sale is perfected at the moment there is a meeting of the minds upon 
the thing which is the object of the interest and upon its price.'<br><br>It is 
not necessary for the perfection of the contract of sale that the thing be 
delivered and that the price be paid.&nbsp; Neither is it necessary that the thing 
should belong to the vendor at the time of the perfection of the contract, it 
being sufficient that the vendor has the right to transfer ownership thereof at 
the time it is delivered." 
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The shoe was now on the other foot.&nbsp; It was the ACEROS' turn to move for 
reconsideration, which they did as regards this Order of October 1, 1982; but by 
Order promulgated on December 14, 1982, the Court declined to modify its 
resolution.<br><br>The ACEROS then appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court 
which, after due proceedings, sustained them.&nbsp; On September 14, 1984, it 
rendered judgment the dispositive part whereof reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Orders of October 1 and December 14, 1982 of the 
Court <em>a quo</em> are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and in their stead, it 
is hereby adjudged:
<p></p></blockquote>
<ol><li>That the Order of February 15, 1980 of the Court <em>a quo</em> is hereby 
ordered reinstated;<br><br></li><li>That intervenor PNB must deliver the amount stated in the Order of February 
15, 1980 with interest thereon at 12% from February 15, 1980 until delivered to 
appellants, the amount of interest to be paid by PNB and not to be deducted from 
the deposit of Isabela Wood;<br><br></li><li>That intervenor PNB must pay attorney's fees and expenses of litigation to 
appellants in the amount of P10,000.00 plus the costs of suit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></li></ol>This dispositive part was 
subsequently modified, at the ACEROS' instance, by Resolution dated November 8, 
1984 which <em>inter alia</em> "additionally ** (ordered) PNB to likewise 
deliver to appellants the balance of the deposit of Isabela Wood Construction 
and Development Corporation after first deducting the amount applied to the 
partial judgment of P1,532,000.00 in satisfaction of appellants' final 
judgment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>PNB's main thesis 
is that when it opened a savings account for ISABELA on March 9, 1979 in the 
amount of P2M, it (PNB) became indebted to ISABELA in that amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> So that when ISABELA itself subsequently 
came to be indebted to it on account of ISABELA's breach of the terms of the 
Credit Agreement of October 13, 1977, and therefore ISABELA and PNB became at 
the same time creditors and debtors of each other, compensation automatically 
took place between them, in accordance with Article 1278 of the Civil Code.&nbsp; The 
amounts due from each other were, in its view, applied by operation of law to 
satisfy and extinguish their respective credits.&nbsp; More specifically, the P2M 
owed by PNB to ISABELA was automatically applied in payment and extinguishment 
of PNB's own credit against ISABELA.&nbsp; This having taken place, that amount of 
P2M could no longer be levied on by any other creditor of ISABELA, as the ACEROS 
attempted to do in the case at bar, in order to satisfy their judgment against 
ISABELA.<br><br>Article 1278 of the Civil Code does indeed provide that 
"Compensation shall take place when two persons, in their own right, are 
creditors and debtors of each other." Also true is that compensation may 
transpire by operation of law, as when all the requisites therefor, set out in 
Article 1279, are present.&nbsp; Nonetheless, these legal provisions can not apply to 
PNB's advantage under the circumstances of the case at bar.<br><br>The 
insuperable obstacle to the success of PNB's cause is the factual finding of the 
IAC, by which upon firmly established rules even this Court is bound<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>, that it has not proven by competent 
evidence that it is a creditor of ISABELA.&nbsp; The only evidence presented by PNB 
towards this end consists of two (2) documents marked in its behalf as Exhibits 
1 and 2.&nbsp; But as the IAC has cogently observed, these documents do not prove any 
indebtedness of ISABELA to PNB.&nbsp; All they do prove is that a letter of credit 
might have been opened for ISABELA by PNB, but not that the credit was ever 
availed of (by ISABELA's foreign correspondent [MAN]), or that the goods thereby 
covered were in fact shipped, and received by ISABELA.<br><br>Quite obviously, 
as the IAC has further observed, the most persuasive evidence of these facts — 
<em>i.e.</em>., ISABELA.s availment of the credit, as well as the actual 
delivery of the goods covered by and shipped pursuant to the letter of credit — 
assuming these facts to have occurred, would naturally and logically have been 
in PNB's possession and could have been readily submitted to the Court, to 
wit:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "1.&nbsp; The document of availment by the foreign creditor of the 
letter of credit.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; The document of release of the amounts 
mentioned in the agreement.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; The documents showing that the 
trucks (transported to the Philippines by the foreign creditor [MAN]) were 
shipped to ** and received by Isabela.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; The trust receipts by 
which possession was given to Isabela of the 35 (Imported) trucks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
5.&nbsp; The chattel mortgages over the trucks required under No. 3 of II Collaterals 
of the Credit Agreement (Exhibit 1).<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; The receipt by Isabela of 
the standing accounts sent by PNB.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.&nbsp; The receipt of the letter of 
demand by Isabela Wood."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>It 
bears stressing that PNB did not at all want for opportunity to produce these 
documents, if it does indeed have them.&nbsp; Judge Solano, it should be recalled, 
specifically allowed PNB to introduce evidence in relation to its Motion for 
Reconsideration filed on August 26, 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and thus furnished the occasion for PNB 
to prove, among others, ISABELA's debt to it.&nbsp; PNB unaccountably failed to do 
so.&nbsp; Moreover, PNB never even attempted to offer or exhibit such evidence, in 
the course of the appellate proceedings before the IAC, which is a certain 
indication, in that Court's view, that PNB does not really have these proofs at 
all.<br><br>For this singular omission PNB offers no explanation except that it 
saw no necessity to submit the documents in evidence, because sometime on March 
14, 1980, the ACEROS' attorney had been shown those precise documents — setting 
forth ISABELA's loan obligations, such as the import bills and the sight draft 
covering drawings on the L/C for ISABELA's account — and after all, the ACEROS 
had not really put this indebtedness in issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The explanation cannot be taken 
seriously.&nbsp; In the picturesque but forceful language of the Appellate Court, the 
explanation "is silly as you do not prove a fact in issue by showing evidence in 
support thereof to the opposing counsel; you prove it by submitting evidence to 
the proper court." The fact is that the record does not disclose that the ACEROS 
have ever admitted the asserted theory of ISABELA's indebtedness to PNB.&nbsp; At any 
rate, not being privies to whatever transactions might have generated that 
indebtedness, they were clearly not in a position to make any declaration on the 
matter.&nbsp; The fact is, too, that the avowed indebtedness of ISABELA was an 
essential element of PNB's claim to the former's P2 million deposit and hence, 
it was incumbent on the latter to demonstrate it by competent evidence if it 
wished its claim to be judicially recognized and enforced.&nbsp; This, it has failed 
to do.&nbsp; The failure is fatal to its claim.<br><br>PNB has however posited an 
alternative theory, which is that the P2M deposit had been assigned to it by 
ISABELA as "collateral", although not by way of pledge; that ISABELA had 
explicitly authorized it to apply the P2M deposit in payment of its 
indebtedness; and that PNB had in fact applied the deposit to the payment of 
ISABELA's debt on February 26, 1980, in concept of voluntary compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> This second, alternative theory, is as 
untenable as the first.<br><br>In the first place, there being no indebtedness 
to PNB on ISABELA's part, there is in consequence no occasion to speak of any 
mutual set-off, or compensation, whether it be legal, <em>i.e.</em>., which 
automatically occurs by operation of law, or voluntary, <em>i.e.</em>, which can 
only take place by agreement of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the second place, the documents 
indicated by PNB as constitutive of the claimed assignment do not in truth make 
out any such transaction.&nbsp; While the Credit Agreement of October 13, 1977 (Exh. 
1) declares it to be ISABELA's intention to "assign to the BANK the proceeds of 
its contract with the Department of Public Works for the construction of Nagapit 
Suspension Bridge (Substructure) in Cagayan"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>, it does not appear that that intention 
was adhered to, much less carried out.&nbsp; The letter of ISABELA's president dated 
February 21, 1979 (Exh. 2) would on the contrary seem to indicate the 
abandonment of that intention, in the light of the statements therein that the 
amount of P2M (representing the bulk of the proceeds of its contract referred 
to) "shall be placed in a savings account" and that "said amount shall remain in 
the savings account until ** (ISABELA is) able to comply with" specified 
commitments — these being:&nbsp; the constitution and registration of a mortgage in 
PNB's favor over its "Parañaque property", and the obtention from the first 
mortgage thereof of consent for the creation of a second lien on the 
property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> These statements are to be 
sure inconsistent with the notion of an assignment of the money.&nbsp; In addition, 
there is yet another circumstance militating against the actuality of such an 
assignment — the "most telling argument" against it, in fact, in the mind of the 
Appellate Court — and that is, that PNB itself, through its International 
Department, deposited the whole amount of P2 million, not in its name, but in 
the name of ISABELA<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>, without any 
accompanying statement even remotely intimating that it (PNB) was the owner of 
the deposit, or that an assignment thereof was intended, or that some condition 
or lien was meant to burden it.<br><br>Even if it be assumed that such an 
assignment had indeed been made, and PNB had been really authorized to apply the 
P2M deposit to the satisfaction of ISABELA's indebtedness to it, nevertheless, 
since the record reveals that the application was attempted to be made by PNB 
only on February 26, 1980, that essayed application was ineffectual and futile 
because at that time, the deposit was already in <em>custodia legis</em>, notice 
of garnishment thereof having been served on PNB on January 9, 1980 (pursuant to 
the writ of execution issued by the Court of First Instance on December 23, 1979 
for the enforcement of the partial judgment in the ACEROS' favor rendered on 
November 18, 1979).<br><br>One final factor precludes according validity to 
PNB's arguments.&nbsp; On the assumption that the P2M deposit was in truth assigned 
as some sort of "collateral" to PNB — although as PNB insists, it was not in the 
form of a pledge — the agreement postulated by PNB that it had been authorized 
to assume ownership of the fund upon the coming into being of ISABELA's 
indebtedness is void <em>ab initio</em>, it being in the nature of a<em> pactum 
commisorium</em>, proscribed as contrary to public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the 
judgment of the Intermediate Appellate Court subject of the instant appeal, 
being fully in accord with the facts and the law, is hereby affirmed <em>in
