				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This is a petition under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court to
prohibit respondents from further implementing and enforcing the &quot;Revised
and Restated Agreement to Build, Lease and Transfer a Light Rail Transit System
for EDSA&quot; dated April 22, 1992, and the &quot;Supplemental Agreement to
the 22 April 1992 Revised and Restated Agreement To Build, Lease and Transfer a
Light Rail Transit System for EDSA&quot; dated May 6, 1993.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners Francisco S. Tatad, John H. Osmena and Rodolfo G.
Biazon are members of the Philippine Senate and are suing in their capacities
as Senators and as taxpayers.  Respondent Jesus B. Garcia, Jr. is the incumbent Secretary of the
Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC), while private
respondent EDSA LRT Corporation, Ltd. is a private corporation organized under
the laws of Hongkong.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS>I</p>

<p class=BODY>In 1989, DOTC planned to construct a light railway transit line
along EDSA, a major thoroughfare in Metropolitan Manila, which shall traverse
the cities of Pasay, Quezon, Mandaluyong and Makati.  The plan, referred to as EDSA Light Rail Transit III (EDSA LRT
III), was intended to provide a mass transit system along EDSA and alleviate the
congestion and growing transportation problem in the metropolis.</p>

<p class=BODY>On March 3, 1990, a letter of intent was sent by the Eli Levin
Enterprises, Inc., represented by Elijahu Levin, to DOTC Secretary Oscar Orbos,
proposing to construct the EDSA LRT III on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)
basis.</p>

<p class=BODY>On March 15, 1990, Secretary Orbos invited Levin to send a
technical team to discuss the project with DOTC.</p>

<p class=BODY>On July 9, 1990, Republic Act No. 6957 entitled &quot;An Act
Authorizing the Financing, Construction, Operation and Maintenance of
Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector, and For Other Purposes,&quot;
was signed by President Corazon C. Aquino.  Referred to as the Build-Operate­-Transfer (BOT) Law, it took effect on
October 9, 1990.</p>

<p class=BODY>Republic Act No. 6957 provides for two schemes for the financing,
construction and operation of government projects through private initiative
and investment:  Build-Operate­-Transfer
(BOT) or Build-Transfer (BT).</p>

<p class=BODY>In accordance with the provisions of R.A. No. 6957 and to set the
EDSA LRT III project underway, DOTC, on January 22, 1991 and March 14, 1991,
issued Department Orders Nos. 91-494 and 91-496, respectively creating the
Prequalification Bids and Awards Committee (PBAC) and the Technical Committee.</p>

<p class=BODY>After its constitution, the PBAC issued guidelines for the
prequalification of contractors for the financing and implementation of the
project.  The notice, advertising the
prequalification of bidders, was published in three newspapers of general circulation
once a week for three consecutive weeks starting February 21, 1991.</p>

<p class=BODY>The deadline set for submission of prequalification documents was
March 21, 1991, later extended to April 1, 1991.  Five groups responded to the invitation:  namely, ABB Trazione of Italy, Hopewell
Holdings, Ltd. of Hongkong, Mansteel International of Mandaue, Cebu, Mitsui
&amp; Co., Ltd. of Japan, and EDSA LRT Consortium, composed of ten foreign and
domestic corporations:  namely, Kaiser
Engineers International, Inc., ACER Consultants (Far East) Ltd., Freeman Fox,
Tradeinvest/CKD Tatra of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republics, TCGI
Engineering, All Asia Capital and Leasing Corporation, The Salim Group of
Jakarta, E.L. Enterprises, Inc., A.M. Oreta &amp; Co., Inc., Capitol Industrial
Construction Group, Inc. and F.F. Cruz &amp; Co., Inc.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the last day for submission of prequalification documents, the
prequalification criteria proposed by the Technical Committee were adopted by
the PBAC.  The criteria, totalling 100
percent, are as follows:  (a) Legal
aspects -- 10 percent; (b) Management/Organizational capability -- ­30 percent;
(c) Financial capability -- 30 percent; and (d) Technical capability -- 30
percent (Rollo, p. 122).</p>

<p class=BODY>On April 3, 1991, the Committee, charged under the BOT Law with
the formulation of the Implementing Rules and Regulations thereof, approved the
same.</p>

<p class=BODY>After evaluating the prequalification bids, the PBAC issued a
Resolution on May 9, 1991 declaring that of the five applicants, only the EDSA
LRT Consortium &quot;met the requirements of garnering at least 21 points per
criteria [sic], except for Legal Aspects, and obtaining an over-all passing
mark of at least 82 points&quot; (Rollo, p. 146).  The Legal Aspects referred to provided that the BOT/BT
contractor-applicant meet the requirements specified in the Constitution and
other pertinent laws (Rollo, p. 114).</p>

<p class=BODY>Subsequently, Secretary Orbos was appointed Executive Secretary
to the President of the Philippines and was replaced by Secretary Pete
Nicomedes Prado.  The latter sent to
President Aquino two letters dated May 31, 1991 and June 14, 1991, respectively
recommending the award of the EDSA LRT III project to the sole complying
bidder, the EDSA LRT Consortium, and requesting for authority to negotiate with
the said firm for the contract pursuant to paragraph 14(b) of the Implementing
Rules and Regulations of the BOT Law (Rollo, pp. 298-302).</p>

<p class=BODY>In July 1991, Executive Secretary Orbos, acting on instructions
of the President, issued a directive to the DOTC to proceed with the
negotiations.  On July 16, 1991, the
EDSA LRT Consortium submitted its bid proposal to DOTC.</p>

<p class=BODY>Finding this proposal to be in<span style='font-size:11.0pt'> </span>compliance
with the bid requirements, DOTC and respondent EDSA LRT Corporation, Ltd., in
substitution of the EDSA LRT Consortium, entered into an<span style='font-size:
11.0pt'> </span>&quot;Agreement to Build, Lease and Transfer a Light Rail
Transit System for EDSA&quot; under the terms of the BOT Law (Rollo, pp.
147-177).</p>

<p class=BODY>Secretary Prado, thereafter, requested presidential approval of
the contract.</p>

<p class=BODY>In a letter dated March 13, 1992, Executive Secretary Franklin
Drilon, who replaced Executive Secretary Orbos, informed Secretary Prado that
the President could not grant the requested approval for the following
reasons:  (1) that DOTC failed to
conduct actual public bidding in compliance with Section 5 of the BOT Law; (2)
that the law authorized public bidding as the only mode to award BOT projects,
and the prequalification proceedings was not the public bidding contemplated
under the law; (3) that Item 14 of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of
the BOT Law which authorized negotiated award of contract in addition to public
bidding was of doubtful legality; and (4) that congressional approval of the
list of priority projects under the BOT or BT Scheme provided in the law had
not yet been granted at the time the contract was awarded (Rollo, pp. 178-179).</p>

<p class=BODY>In view of the comments of Executive Secretary Drilon, the DOT
and private respondents re-negotiated the agreement.  On April 22, 1992, the parties entered into a &quot;Revised and
Restated Agreement to Build, Lease and Transfer a Light Rail Transit System for
EDSA&quot; (Rollo, pp. 47-78) inasmuch as &quot;the parties [are] cognizant of
the fact the DOTC has full authority to sign the Agreement without need of
approval by the President pursuant to the provisions of Executive Order No. 380
and that certain events [had] supervened since November 7, 1991 which
necessitate[d] the revision of the Agreement&quot; (Rollo, p. 51).  On May 6, 1992, DOTC, represented by
Secretary Jesus Garcia <u>vice</u> Secretary Prado, and private respondent
entered into a &quot;Supplemental Agreement to the 22 April 1992 Revised and
Restated Agreement to Build, Lease and Transfer a Light Rail Transit System for
EDSA&quot; so as to &quot;clarify their respective rights and responsibilities”
and to &quot;submit [the] Supplemental Agreement to the President of the Philippines
for his approval&quot; (Rollo, pp. 79-80).</p>

<p class=BODY>Secretary Garcia submitted the two Agreements to President Fidel
V. Ramos for his consideration and approval.  In a Memorandum to Secretary Garcia on May 6, 1993, President Ramos
approved the said Agreements (Rollo, p. 194).</p>

<p class=BODY>According to the agreements, the EDSA LRT III will use light rail
vehicles from the Czech and Slovak Federal Republics and will have a maximum
carrying capacity of 450,000 passengers a day, or 150 million a year to be
achieved through 54 such vehicles operating simultaneously.  The EDSA LRT III will run at grade, or
street level, on the mid-section of EDSA for a distance of 17.8 kilometers from
F.B. Harrison, Pasay City to North Avenue, Quezon City.  The system will have its own power facility
(Revised and Restated Agreement, Sec. 2.3 (ii); Rollo, p. 55).  It will also have thirteen (13) passenger
stations and one depot in the 16-hectare government property at North Avenue
(Supplemental Agreement, Sec. 11; Rollo, pp. 91-92).</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondent shall undertake and finance the entire project
required for a complete operational light rail transit system (Revised and
Restated Agreement, Sec. 4.1; Rollo, p. 58).  Target completion date is 1,080 days or approximately three years from
the implementation date of the contract inclusive of mobilization, site works,
initial and final testing of the system (Supplemental Agreement, Sec. 5; Rollo,
p. 83).  Upon full or partial completion
and viability thereof, private respondent shall deliver the use and possession
of the completed portion to DOTC which shall operate the same (Supplemental
Agreement, Sec. 5; Revised and Restated Agreement, Sec. 5.1; Rollo, pp. 61-62,
84).  DOTC shall pay private respondent
rentals on a monthly basis through an Irrevocable Letter of Credit.  The rentals shall be determined by an
independent and internationally accredited inspection firm to be appointed by
the parties (Supplemental Agreement, Sec. 6; Rollo, pp. 85-86).  As agreed upon, private respondent's capital
shall be recovered from the rentals to be paid by the DOTC which, in turn,
shall come from the earnings of the EDSA LRT III (Revised and Restated
Agreement, Sec. 1, p. 5; Rollo, p. 54).  After 25 years and DOTC shall have completed payment of the rentals,
ownership of the project shall be transferred to the latter for a consideration
of only U.S. $1.00 (Revised and Restated Agreement, Sec. 11.1; Rollo, p. 67).</p>

<p class=BODY>On May 5, 1994, R.A. No. 7718, an &quot;Act Amending Certain
Sections of Republic Act No. 6957, Entitled 'An Act Authorizing the Financing,
Construction, Operation and Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the
Private Sector, and for Other Purposes'&quot; was signed into law by the
President.  The law was published in two
newspapers of general circulation on May 12, 1994, and took effect 15 days
thereafter or on May 28, 1994.  The law
expressly recognizes a BLT scheme and allows direct negotiation of BLT
contracts.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS>II</p>

<p class=BODY>In their petition, petitioners argued that:</p>

<blockquote>“(1)  THE AGREEMENT OF APRIL 22, 1992, AS AMENDED
BY THE SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENT OF MAY 6, 1993, INSOFAR AS IT GRANTS EDSA LRT

<p class=NUMROMANS>III</p>

<p class=BODY>Respondents claimed that petitioners had no legal standing to
initiate the instant action.  Petitioners,
however, countered that the action was filed by them in their capacity as
Senators and as taxpayers.</p>

<p class=BODY>The prevailing doctrines in taxpayer's suits are to allow
taxpayers to question contracts entered into by the national government or
government-owned or controlled corporations allegedly in contravention of the
law (Kilosbayan, Inc. v. Guingona, 232 SCRA 110 [1994]) and to disallow the
same when only municipal contracts are involved (Bugnay Construction and
Development Corporation v. Laron, 176 SCRA 240 [1989]).</p>

<p class=BODY>For as long as the ruling in <u>Kilosbayan</u> on <u>locus</u> <u>standi</u>
is not reversed, we have no choice<i> </i>but to follow it and uphold the legal
standing of petitioners as taxpayers to institute the present action.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS>IV</p>

<p class=BODY>In the main, petitioners asserted that the Revised and Restated
Agreement of April 22, 1992 and the Supplemental Agreement of May 6, 1993 are
unconstitutional and invalid for the following reasons:</p>

<blockquote><![if !supportLists]>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>the EDSA LRT III is a public utility, and the ownership and
operation thereof is limited by the Constitution to Filipino citizens and
domestic corporations, not foreign corporations like private respondent;</blockquote>

<blockquote><![if !supportLists]>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>the Build-Lease-Transfer (BLT) scheme provided in the
agreements is not the BOT or BT scheme under the law;</blockquote>

<blockquote><![if !supportLists]>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>the contract to construct the EDSA LRT III was awarded to
private respondent not through public bidding which is the only mode of
awarding infrastructure projects under the BOT law; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><![if !supportLists]>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>the agreements are grossly disadvantageous to the government.</blockquote>

<p class=NUM>1. Private respondent EDSA LRT Corporation, Ltd. to whom the
contract to construct the EDSA LRT III was awarded by public respondent, is
admittedly a foreign corporation &quot;duly incorporated and existing under the
laws of Hongkong&quot; (Rollo, pp. 50, 79).  There is also no dispute that once the EDSA LRT III is constructed,
private respondent, as lessor, will turn it over to DOTC, as lessee, for the
latter to operate the system and pay rentals for said use.</p>

<p class=BODY>The question posed by petitioners is:<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>  </span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;Can respondent EDSA LRT Corporation, Ltd., a foreign
corporation own EDSA LRT III, a public utility?&quot; (Rollo, p. 17).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The phrasing of the question is erroneous; it is loaded.  What private respondent owns are the rail
tracks, rolling stocks like the coaches, rail stations, terminals and the power
plant, not a public utility.  While a
franchise is needed to operate these facilities to serve the public, they do
not by themselves constitute a public utility.  What constitutes a public utility is not their ownership but their use
to serve the public (Iloilo Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co. v. Public Service Board,
44 Phil. 551, 557­-558 [1923]).</p>

<p class=BODY>The Constitution, in no uncertain terms, requires a franchise for
the operation of a public utility.  However, it does not require a franchise before one can own the
facilities needed to operate a public utility so long as it does not operate
them to serve the public.</p>

<p class=BODY>Section 11 of Article XII of the Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;No franchise, certificate or any other form of authorization
for the <u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>operation</span></u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> </span><u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>public</span></u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'> <u>utility</u> </span>shall be granted except to citizens of the
Philippines or to corporations or associations organized under the laws of the
Philippines at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such
citizens, nor shall such franchise, certificate or authorization be exclusive
in character or for a longer period than fifty years xxx&quot; (Underscoring<b>
</b>supplied).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In law, there is a clear distinction between the
&quot;operation&quot; of a public utility and the ownership of the facilities
and equipment used to serve the public.</p>

<p class=BODY>Ownership is defined as relation in law by virtue of which a
thing pertaining to one person is completely subjected to his will in
everything not prohibited by law or the concurrence with the rights of another
(Tolentino, II Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code of the
Philippines 45 [1992]).</p>

<p class=BODY>The exercise of the rights encompassed in ownership is limited by
law so that a property cannot be operated and used to serve the public as a
public utility unless the operator has a franchise.  The operation of a rail system as a public utility includes the
transportation of passengers from one point to another point, their loading and
unloading at designated places and the movement of the trains at pre-scheduled
times (<u>cf</u>. Arizona Eastern R.R. Co. v. J.A. Matthews, 20 Ariz 282, 180
P. 159, 7 A.L.R. 1149 [1919]; United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Northern P.R. Co.,
30 Wash 2d. 722, 193 P. 2d 868, 2 A.L.R. 2d 1065 [1948]).</p>

<p class=BODY>The right to operate a public utility may exist independently and
separately from the ownership of the facilities thereof.  One can own said facilities without
operating them as a public utility, or conversely, one may operate a public
utility without owning the facilities used to serve the public.  The devotion of property to serve the public
may be done by the owner or by the person in control thereof who may not
necessarily be the owner thereof.</p>

<p class=BODY>This dichotomy between the operation of a public utility and the
ownership of the facilities used to serve the public can be very well
appreciated when we consider the transportation industry.  Enfranchised airline and shipping companies
may lease their aircraft and vessels instead of owning them themselves.</p>

<p class=BODY>While private respondent is the owner of the facilities necessary
to operate the EDSA LRT III, it admits that it is not enfranchised to operate a
public utility (Revised and Restated Agreement, Sec. 3.2; Rollo, p. 57).  In view of this incapacity, private
respondent and DOTC agreed that on completion date, private respondent will<b><span
style='font-size:5.0pt'> </span></b>immediately deliver possession of the LRT
system by way of lease for 25 years, during which period DOTC shall operate the
same as a common carrier and private respondent shall provide technical
maintenance and repair services to DOTC (Revised and Restated Agreement, Secs.
3.2, 5.1 and 5.2; Rollo, pp. 57-58, 61-62).  Technical maintenance consists of providing (1) repair and maintenance
facilities for the depot and rail lines, services for routine clearing and
security; and (2) producing and distributing maintenance manuals and drawings
for the entire system (Revised and Restated Agreement, Annex F).</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondent shall also train DOTC personnel for
familiarization with the operation, use, maintenance and repair of the rolling
stock, power plant, substations, electrical, signalling, communications and all
other equipment as supplied in the agreement (Revised and Restated Agreement,
Sec. 10; Rollo, pp. 66-67).  Training
consists of theoretical and live training of DOTC operational personnel which
includes actual driving of light rail vehicles under simulated operating
conditions, control of operations, dealing with emergencies, collection,
counting and securing cash from the fare collection system (Revised and
Restated Agreement, Annex E, Secs. 2-3).  Personnel of DOTC will work under the direction and control of private
respondent only during training (Revised and Restated Agreement, Annex E, Sec.
3.1).  The training objectives, however,
shall be such that upon completion of the EDSA LRT III and upon opening of
normal revenue operation, DOTC shall have in their employ personnel capable of
undertaking training of all new and replacement personnel (Revised and Restated
Agreement, Annex E, Sec. 5.1).  In other
words, by the end of the three-year construction period and upon commencement
of normal revenue operation, DOTC shall be able to operate the EDSA LRT III on
its own and train all new personnel by itself.</p>

<p class=BODY>Fees for private respondent's services shall be included in the
rent, which likewise includes the project cost, cost of replacement of plant
equipment and spare parts, investment and financing cost, plus a reasonable
rate of return thereon (Revised and Restated Agreement, Sec. 1; Rollo, p. 54).</p>

<p class=BODY>Since DOTC shall operate the EDSA LRT III, it shall assume all
the obligations and liabilities of a common carrier.  For this purpose, DOTC shall indemnify and hold harmless private
respondent from any losses, damages, injuries or death which may be claimed in
the operation or implementation of the system, except losses, damages, injury
or death due to defects in the EDSA LRT III on account of the defective
condition of equipment or facilities or the defective maintenance of such
equipment or facilities (Revised and Restated Agreement, Secs. 12.1 and 12.2;
Rollo, p. 68).</p>

<p class=BODY>In sum, private respondent will not run the light rail vehicles
and collect fees from the riding public.  It will have no dealings with the public and the public will have no
right to demand any services from it.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is well to point out that the role of private respondent as
lessor during the lease period must be distinguished from the role of the
Philippine Gaming Management Corporation (PGMC) in the case of <u>Kilosbayan,</u>
<u>Inc.</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Guingona</u>, 232 SCRA 110 (1994).  Therein, the Contract of Lease between PGMC
and the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) was actually a
collaboration or joint venture agreement proscribed under the charter of the
PCSO.  In the Contract of Lease, PGMC,
the lessor obligated itself to build, at its own expense, all the facilities
necessary to operate and maintain a nationwide on-line lottery system from whom
PCSO was to lease the facilities and operate the same.  Upon due examination of the contract, the
Court found that PGMC's participation was not confined to the construction and
setting up of the on-line lottery system.  It spilled over to the actual operation thereof, becoming indispensable
to the pursuit, conduct, administration and control of the highly technical and
sophisticated lottery system.  In
effect, the PCSO leased out its franchise to PGMC which actually operated and
managed the same.</p>

<p class=BODY>Indeed, a mere owner and lessor of the facilities used by a
public utility is not a public utility (Providence and W.R. Co. v. United
States, 46 F. 2d 149, 152 [1930]; Chippewa Power Co. v. Railroad Commission of
Wisconsin, 205 N.W. 900, 903, 188 Wis. 246 [1925]; Ellis v. Interstate Commerce
Commission, Ill. 35 S. Ct. 645, 646, 237 U.S. 434, 59 L. Ed. 1036 [1914]).  Neither are owners of tank, refrigerator,
wine, poultry and beer cars who supply cars under contract to railroad
companies considered as public utilities (Crystal Car Line v. State Tax
Commission, 174 P. 2d 984, 987 [1946]).</p>

<p class=BODY>Even the mere formation of a public utility corporation does not <u>ipso</u>
<u>facto</u> characterize the corporation as one operating a public
utility.  The moment for determining the
requisite Filipino nationality is when the entity applies for a franchise,
certificate or any other form of authorization for that purpose (People v.
Quasha, 93 Phil. 333 [1953]).</p>

<p class=NUM>2. Petitioners further assert that the BLT scheme under the
Agreements in question is not recognized in the BOT Law and its Implementing
Rules and Regulations.</p>

<p class=BODY>Section 2 of the BOT Law defines the BOT and BT schemes as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;(a)  Build-operate-and-transfer scheme - A
contractual arrangement whereby the contractor undertakes the construction,
including financing, of a given infrastructure facility, and the operation and
maintenance thereof.  The contractor
operates the facility over a fixed term during which it is allowed to charge
facility users appropriate tolls, fees, rentals, and charges sufficient to
enable the contractor to recover its operating and maintenance expenses and its
investment in the project plus a reasonable rate of return thereon.  The contractor transfers the facility to the
government agency or local government unit concerned at the end of the fixed
term which shall not exceed fifty (50) years.  For the construction stage, the contractor may obtain financing from
foreign and/or domestic sources and/or engage the services of a foreign and/or
Filipino constructor [sic]: Provided, <u>That</u> <u>the</u> <u>ownership</u> <u>structure</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>contractor</u> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>infrastructure</u>
<u>facility</u> <u>whose</u> <u>operation</u> <u>requires</u> <u>a</u> <u>public</u>
<u>utility</u> <u>franchise</u> <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>in</u> <u>accordance</u>
<u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>Constitution</u>:  Provided, however, That in the case of corporate investors in the build­-operate-and-transfer
corporation, the citizenship of each stockholder in the corporate investors
shall be the basis for the computation of Filipino equity in the said corporation:  Provided, further, That, in the case of
foreign constructors [sic], Filipino labor shall be employed or hired in the
different phases of the construction where Filipino skills are available:  Provided, furthermore, that the financing of
a foreign or foreign-controlled contractor from Philippine government financing
institutions shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total cost of the
infrastructure facility or project:  Provided, finally, That financing from foreign sources shall not require
a guarantee by the Government or by government-owned or controlled
corporations.  The
build-operate-and-transfer scheme shall include a supply-and-operate situation
which is a contractual arrangement whereby the supplier of equipment and
machinery for a given infrastructure facility, if the interest of the
Government so requires, operates the facility providing in the process
technology transfer and training to Filipino nationals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  Build-and-transfer scheme - A contractual arrangement
whereby the contractor undertakes the construction including financing, of a
given infrastructure facility, and its turnover after completion to the
government agency or local government unit concerned which shall pay the
contractor its total investment expended on the project, plus a reasonable rate
of return thereon.  This arrangement may
be employed in the construction of any infrastructure project including
critical facilities which for security or strategic reasons, must be operated
directly by the government&quot; (Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The BOT scheme is expressly defined as one where the contractor
undertakes the construction and financing of an infrastructure facility, and
operates and maintains the same.  The
contractor operates the facility for a fixed period during which it may recover
its expenses and investment in the project plus a reasonable rate of return
thereon.  After the expiration of the
agreed term, the contractor transfers the ownership and operation of the
project to the government.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the BT scheme, the contractor undertakes the construction and
financing of the facility, but after completion, the ownership and operation
thereof are turned over to the government.  The government, in turn, shall pay the contractor its total investment
on the project in addition to a reasonable rate of return.  If payment is to be effected through
amortization payments by the government infrastructure agency or local
government unit concerned, this shall be made in accordance with a scheme
proposed in the bid and incorporated in the contract (R.A. No. 6957, Sec. 6).</p>

<p class=BODY>Emphasis must be made that under the BOT scheme, the owner of the
infrastructure facility must comply with the citizenship requirement of the
Constitution on the operation of a public utility.  No such a requirement is imposed in the BT scheme.</p>

<p class=BODY>There is no mention in the BOT Law that the BOT and BT schemes
bar any other arrangement for the payment by the government of the project
cost.  The law must not be read in such
a way as to rule out or unduly restrict any variation within the context of the
two schemes.  Indeed, no statute can be
enacted to anticipate and provide all the fine points and details for the
multifarious and complex situations that may be encountered in enforcing the law
(Director of Forestry v.  Munoz, 23 SCRA
1183 [1968]; People v. Exconde, 101 Phil. 1125 [1957]; United States v. Tupasi
Molina, 29 Phil. 119 [1914]).</p>

<p class=BODY>The BLT scheme in the challenged agreements is but a variation of
the BT scheme under the law.</p>

<p class=BODY>As a matter of fact, the burden on the government in raising
funds to pay for the project is made lighter by allowing it to amortize
payments out of the income from the operation of the LRT System.</p>

<p class=BODY>In form and substance, the challenged agreements provide that
rentals are to be paid on a monthly basis according to a schedule of rates
through and under the terms of a confirmed Irrevocable Revolving Letter of
Credit (Supplemental Agreement, Sec. 6; Rollo, p. 85).  At the end of 25 years and when full payment
shall have been made to and received by private respondent, it shall transfer
to DOTC, free from any lien or encumbrances, all its title to, rights and
interest in, the project for only U.S. $1.00 (Revised and Restated Agreement,
Sec. 11.1; Supplemental Agreement, Sec. 7; Rollo, pp. 67, 87).</p>

<p class=BODY>A lease is a contract where one of the parties binds himself to
give to another the enjoyment or use of a thing for a certain price and for a
period which may be definite or indefinite but not longer than 99 years (Civil
Code of the Philippines, Art. 1643).  There is no transfer of ownership at the end of the lease period.  But if the parties stipulate that title to
the leased premises shall be transferred to the lessee at the end of the lease
period upon the payment of an agreed sum, the lease becomes a lease-purchase
agreement.</p>

<p class=BODY>Furthermore, it is of no <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>significance
</span>that the rents shall be paid in United States currency, not Philippine
pesos.  The EDSA LRT III Project is a
high priority project certified by Congress and the National Economic and
Development Authority as falling under the Investment Priorities Plan of
Government (Rollo, pp. 310-311).  It is,
therefore, outside the application of the Uniform Currency Act (R. A. No. 529),
which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 1. - Every provision contained in, or made with respect
to, any domestic obligation to wit, any obligation contracted in the
Philippines which provisions purports to give the obligee the right to require
payment in gold or in a particular kind of coin or currency other than
Philippine currency or in an amount of money of the Philippines measured
thereby, be as it is hereby declared against public policy, and null, void, and
of no effect, and no such provision shall be contained in, or made with respect
to, any obligation hereafter incurred.  The above prohibition shall not apply to (a) x x x; (b) transactions
affecting high-priority economic projects for agricultural, industrial and
power development as may be determined by the National Economic Council which
are financed by or through foreign funds; x x x.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=NUM>3. The fact that the contract for the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>construction </span>of the EDSA LRT III was awarded through <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>negotiation </span>and before congressional
approval on January 22 and 23, 1992 of the List of National Projects to be
undertaken by the private sector pursuant to the BOT Law (Rollo, pp. 309-312)
does not suffice to invalidate the award.</p>

<p class=BODY>Subsequent congressional approval of the list including
&quot;rail-based, projects packaged with commercial development
opportunities&quot; (Rollo, p. 310) under which the EDSA LRT III project falls,
amounts to a ratification of the prior award of the EDSA LRT III contract under
the BOT Law.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners insist that the prequalification process which led to
the negotiated award of the contract appears to have been rigged from the very
beginning to do away with the usual open international public bidding where
qualified internationally known applicants could fairly participate.</p>

<p class=BODY>The records show that only one applicant passed the
prequalification process.  Since only one
was left, to conduct a public bidding in accordance with Section 5 of the BOT
Law for that lone participant will be an absurd and pointless exercise (<u>cf.</u>
Deloso v. Sandiganbayan, 217 SCRA 49, 61 [1993]).</p>

<p class=BODY>Contrary to the comments of then Executive Secretary Drilon,
Section 5 of the BOT Law in relation to Presidential Decree No. 1594 allows the
negotiated award of government infrastructure projects.</p>

<p class=BODY>Presidential Decree No. 1594, &quot;Prescribing Policies,
Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for Government Infrastructure
Contracts,&quot; allows the negotiated award of government projects in
exceptional cases.  Section 4 of the
said law reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;<u>Bidding</u>. -- Construction projects shall generally be
undertaken by contract after competitive public bidding.  <u>Projects</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>undertaken</u>
<u>by</u> <u>administration</u> <u>or</u> <u>force</u> <u>account</u> <u>or</u>
<u>by</u> <u>negotiated</u> <u>contract</u> <u>only</u> <u>in</u> <u>exceptional</u>
<u>cases</u> <u>where</u> <u>time</u> <u>is</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>essence</u>,
<u>or</u> <u>where</u> <u>there</u> <u>is</u> <u>lack</u> <u>of</u> <u>qualified</u>
<u>bidders</u> <u>or</u> <u>contractors</u>, <u>or</u> <u>where</u> <u>there</u>
<u>is</u> <u>conclusive</u> <u>evidence</u> <u>that</u> <u>greater</u> <u>economy</u>
<u>and</u> <u>efficiency</u> <u>would</u> <u>be</u> <u>achieved</u> <u>through</u>
<u>this</u> <u>arrangement</u>, and in accordance with provision of laws and
acts on the matter, subject to the approval of the Minister of Public Works and
Transportation and Communications, the Minister of Public Highways, or the
Minister of Energy, as the case may be, if the project cost is less than P1
Million, and the President of the Philippines, upon recommendation of the
Minister, if the project cost is P1 Million or more (Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style='mso-tab-count:4'>                                            </span>x
x x<span style='mso-tab-count:4'>                                            </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Indeed, where there is a lack of qualified bidders or
contractors, the award of government infrastructure contracts may be made by
negotiation.  Presidential Decree No.
1594 is the general law on government infrastructure contracts while the BOT
Law governs particular arrangements or schemes aimed at encouraging private
sector participation in government infrastructure projects.  The two laws are not inconsistent with each
other but are in <u>pari</u> <u>materia</u> and should be read together
accordingly.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the instant case, if the prequalification process was actually
tainted by foul play, one wonders why none of the competing firms ever brought
the matter before the PBAC, or intervened in this case before us (<u>cf</u>.
Malayan Integrated Industries Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 213 SCRA 640 [1992];
Bureau Veritas v. Office of the President, 205 SCRA 705 [1992]).</p>

<p class=BODY>The challenged agreements have been approved by President Ramos
himself.  Although then Executive
Secretary Drilon may have disapproved the &quot;Agreement to Build, Lease and
Transfer a Light Rail Transit System for EDSA,&quot; there is nothing in our
laws that prohibits parties to a contract from renegotiating and modifying in
good faith the terms and conditions thereof so as to meet legal, statutory and
constitutional requirements.  Under the
circumstances, to require the parties to go back to step one of the
prequalification process would just be an idle ceremony.  Useless bureaucratic &quot;red tape&quot;
should be eschewed because it discourages private sector participation, the
&quot;main engine&quot; for national growth and development (R.A. No. 6957,
Sec. 1), and renders the BOT Law nugatory.</p>

<p class=BODY>Republic Act<span style='font-size:11.0pt'> </span>No. 7718
recognizes and defines a BLT scheme in Section 2 thereof as:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>(e)  Build-lease-and-transfer - A contractual arrangement whereby a project
proponent </span>is authorized to finance and construct an infrastructure or
development facility and upon its completion turns it over to the government
agency or local government unit concerned on a lease arrangement for a fixed
period after which ownership of the facility is automatically transferred <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>to the government agency or local government
unit concerned.&quot;</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Section 5-A of the law, which expressly allows direct negotiation
of contracts, provides:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Direct Negotiation of Contracts. - Direct negotiation shall
be resorted to when there is only one complying bidder left as defined
hereunder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(a)  If, after advertisement, only one
contractor applies for prequalification and it meets the prequalification requirements,
after which it is required to submit a bid proposal which is subsequently found
by the agency/local government unit (LGU) to be complying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b)  If, after advertisement, more than one
contractor applied for prequalification but only one meets the prequalification
requirements, after which it submits bid/proposal which is found by the
agency/local government unit (LGU) to be complying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)  If, after prequalification of more than one
contractor, only one submits a bid which is found by the agency/LGU to be
complying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d)  If, after prequalification, more than one
contractor submit bids but only one is found by the agency/LGU to be
complying.  Provided, That, any of the
disqualified prospective bidder [sic] may appeal the decision of the implementing
agency/LGUs prequalification bids and awards committee within fifteen (15)
working days to the head of the agency, in case of national projects or to the
Department of the Interior and Local Government, in case of local projects from
the date the disqualification was made known to the disqualified bidder:  Provided, furthermore, That the implementing
agency/LGUs concerned should act on the appeal within forty-five (45) working
days from receipt thereof.&quot;<b><span style='font-size:6.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners' claim that the BLT scheme and direct negotiation of
contracts are not contemplated by the BOT Law has now been rendered moot and
academic by R.A. No. 7718.  Section 3 of
this law authorizes all government infrastructure agencies, a government-owned
and controlled corporations and local government units to enter into contract
with any duly prequalified proponent for the financing, construction, operation
and maintenance of any financially viable infrastructure or development
facility through a BOT, BT, BLT, BOO (Build-own-and-operate), BTO
(Build-transfer-and-operate), CAO (Contract-add-operate), DOT
(Develop-operate-and-transfer), ROT (Rehabilitate&#8209;operate-and-transfer),
and ROO (Rehabilitate-own-operate) (R.A. No. 7718, Sec. 2 [b-j]).</p>

<p class=BODY>From the law itself, once an applicant has prequalified, it can
enter into any of the schemes enumerated in Section 2 thereof, including a BLT
arrangement, enumerated and defined therein (Sec. 3).</p>

<p class=BODY>Republic Act No. 7718 is a curative statute.  It is intended to provide financial
incentives and &quot;a climate of minimum government regulations and procedures
and specific government undertakings in support of the private sector&quot;
(Sec. 1).  A curative statute makes
valid that which before enactment of the statute was invalid.  Thus, whatever doubts and alleged procedural
lapses private respondent and DOTC may have engendered and committed in
entering into the questioned contracts, these have now been cured by R.A. No.
7718 (<u>cf</u>. Development Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 96
SCRA 342 [1980]; Santos v. Duata, 14 SCRA 1041 [1965]; Adong v. Cheong Seng
Gee, 43 Phil. 43 [1922]).</p>

<p class=NUM>4. Lastly, petitioners claim that the agreements are grossly
disadvantageous to the government because the rental rates are excessive and
private respondent's development rights over the 13 stations and the depot will
rob DOTC of the best terms during the most productive years of the project.</p>

<p class=BODY>It must be noted that as part of the EDSA LRT III project,
private respondent has been granted, for a period of 25 years, exclusive rights
over the depot and the air space above the stations for development into
commercial premises for lease, sublease, transfer, or advertising (Supplemental
Agreement, Sec. 11; Rollo, pp. 91-92).  For and in consideration of these development rights, private respondent
shall pay DOTC in Philippine currency guaranteed revenues generated therefrom
in the amounts set forth in the Supplemental Agreement (Sec. 11; Rollo, p.
93).  In the event that DOTC shall be
unable to collect the guaranteed revenues, DOTC shall be allowed to deduct any
shortfalls from the monthly rent due private respondent for the construction of
the EDSA LRT III (Supplemental Agreement, Sec. 11; Rollo, pp. 93-94).  All rights, titles, interests and income
over all contracts on the commercial spaces shall revert to DOTC<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> </span>upon expiration of the 25-year period
(Supplemental Agreement, Sec. 11; Rollo, pp. 91-92).</p>

<p class=BODY>The terms of the agreements were arrived at after a painstaking
study by DOTC.  The determination by the
proper administrative agencies and officials who have acquired expertise,
specialized skills and knowledge in the performance of their functions should
be accorded respect, absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion (Felipe
Ysmael, Jr. &amp; Co. v. Deputy Executive Secretary, 190 SCRA 673 [1990]; Board
of Medical Education v. Alfonso, 176 SCRA 304 [1989]).</p>

<p class=BODY>Government officials are presumed to perform their functions with
regularity and strong evidence is necessary to rebut this presumption.  Petitioners have not presented evidence on
the reasonable rentals to be paid by the parties to each other.  The matter of valuation is an esoteric field
which is better left to the experts and which this Court is not eager to
undertake.</p>

<p class=BODY>That the grantee of a government contract will profit therefrom
and to that extent the government is deprived of the profits if it engages in
the business itself, is not worthy of being raised as an issue.  In all cases where a party enters into a
contract with the government, he does so, not out of charity and not to lose
money, but to gain pecuniarily.</p>

<p class=NUM>5. Definitely, the agreements in question have been entered into
by DOTC in the exercise of its governmental function.  DOTC is the primary policy, planning, programming, regulating and
administrative entity of the Executive branch of government in the promotion,
development and regulation of dependable and coordinated networks of
transportation and communications systems as well as in the fast, safe,
efficient and reliable postal, transportation and communications services
(Administrative Code of 1987, Book IV, Title XV, Sec. 2).  It is the Executive department, DOTC in
particular, that has the power, authority and technical expertise to determine
whether or not a specific transportation or communications project is
necessary, viable and beneficial to the people.  The discretion to award a contract is vested in the government
agencies entrusted with that function (Bureau Veritas v. Office of the
President, 205 SCRA 705 [1992]).<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=OTHERHEADING>DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class=DISSENTINGCONCURRING>DAVIDE, JR., <i>J.</i>:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=BODY>After wading through the record of the vicissitudes of the
challenged contract and evaluating the issues raised and the arguments adduced
by the parties, I find myself unable to join the majority in the well-written <i>ponencia</i>
of Mr. Justice Camilo P. Quiason.</p>

<p class=BODY>I most respectfully submit that the challenged contract is void
for at least two reasons:  (a) it is an
ultra-vires act of the Department of Transportation and Communications (DOTC)
since under R.A. 6957 the DOTC has no authority to enter into a Build&#8209;Lease-and-Transfer
(BLT) contract; and (b) even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that it has, the contract
was entered into without complying with the mandatory requirement of public
bidding.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS>I</p>

<p class=BODY>Respondents admit that the assailed contract was entered into
under R.A. 6957.  This law, fittingly
entitled &quot;An Act Authorizing the Financing, Construction, Operation and
Maintenance of Infrastructure Projects by the Private Sector, and For Other Purposes,&quot;
recognizes only two (2) kinds of contractual arrangements between the private
sector and government infrastructure agencies:  (a) the Build-Operate-and-Transfer (BOT) scheme and (b) the
Build-and-Transfer (BT) scheme.  This
conclusion finds support in Section 2 thereof which defines only the BOT and BT
schemes, in Section 3 which explicitly provides for said schemes thus:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 3. <i>Private Initiative in Infrastructure. - </i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>All</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span>government
infrastructure agencies, including government-owned and controlled corporations
and local government units, are hereby authorized to enter into contract with
any duly prequalified private contractor for the financing, construction,
operation and maintenance of any financially viable infrastructure facilities <u>through</u>
<u>the</u> <u>build-operate-and-transfer</u> <u>or</u> <u>build-and-transfer</u>
<u>scheme</u>, subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.  (underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>and in Section 5 which requires public
bidding of projects under both schemes.<span style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>All prior acts and negotiations leading <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>to</span><span style='font-size:11.0pt'> </span>the perfection of the
challenged contract were clearly intended and pursued for such schemes.</p>

<p class=BODY>A Build-Lease-and-Transfer (BLT) scheme is not authorized under
the said law, and none of the aforesaid prior acts and negotiations were
designed for such unauthorized <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>scheme.  Hence, </span>the DOTC is without any power <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>or </span>authority to enter into the BLT
contract in question.<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The majority opinion maintains, however, that since &quot;[t]here
is no mention in the BOT Law that the BOT and the BT schemes bar any other
arrangement for the payment by the government of the project cost,&quot; then
&quot;[t]he law must not be read in such a way as to rule out or unduly
restrict any variation within the context of the two schemes.&quot; This
interpretation would be correct if the law itself provides room for flexibility.  We find no such provision in R.A. No.
6957.  If it intended to include a BLT
scheme, then it should have so stated, for contracts of lease are not unknown
in our jurisdiction, and Congress has enacted several laws relating to leases.  That the BLT scheme was never intended as a
permissible variation &quot;within the context&quot; of the BOT and BT schemes
is conclusively established by the passage of R.A. No. 7718 which amends:</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS>II<span style='font-size:7.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Public bidding is mandatory in R.A. No. 6957.  Section 5 thereof reads as follows:<span
style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>SEC. 5. <i>Public Bidding of Projects</i>. – Upon approval of the
projects mentioned in Section 4 of this Act, the concerned head of the
infrastructure agency or local government unit shall forthwith cause to be
published, once every week for three (3) consecutive weeks, in at least two (2)
newspapers of general circulation and in at least one (1) local newspaper which
is circulated in the region, province, city or municipality in which the
project is to be constructed a notice inviting all duly prequalified
infrastructure contractors to participate in the public bidding for the
projects so approved.  In the case of a
build-operate-and-transfer arrangement, the contract shall be awarded to the
lowest complying bidder based on the present value of its proposed tolls, fees,
rentals, and charges over a fixed term for the facility to be constructed,
operated, and maintained according to the prescribed minimum design and
performance standards, plans, and specifications.  For this purpose, the winning contractor shall be automatically
granted by the infrastructure agency or local government unit the franchise to
operate and maintain the facility, including the collection of tolls, fees,
rentals, and charges in accordance with Section 6 hereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case of a build-and-transfer arrangement, the contract shall
be awarded to the lowest complying bidder based on the present value of its
proposed, schedule of amortization payments for the facility to be constructed
according to the prescribed minimum design and performance standards, plans and
specifications:  <i>Provided, however</i>,
That a Filipino constructor who submits an equally advantageous bid shall be
given preference.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A copy of each build-operate-and-transfer or build-and-transfer
contract shall forthwith be submitted to Congress for its information.<span
style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The requirement of public bidding is not an idle ceremony.  It has been aptly said that in our
jurisdiction &quot;public bidding is the policy and medium adhered to in
Government procurement and construction contracts under existing laws and
regulations.  It is the accepted method
for arriving at a fair and reasonable price and ensures that overpricing,
favoritism and other anomalous practices are eliminated or minimized.  And any Government contract entered into
without the required bidding is null and void and cannot adversely affect the
rights of third parties.&quot; (Bartolome C. Fernandbez, Jr., A TREATISE ON
GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS UNDER PHILIPPINE LAW 25 [rev. ed. 1991], citing Caltex vs.
Delgado Bros., 96 Phil. 368 [1954]).</p>

<p class=BODY>The Office of the President, through then Executive Secretary
Franklin Drilon correctly disapproved the contract because no public bidding in
strict compliance with Section 5 of R.A. <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>No</span><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>. </span>6957 was conducted.  Secretary Drilon further bluntly stated that the provision of the
Implementing Rules of said law authorizing negotiated contracts was of doubtful
legality.  Indeed, it is null and void
because the law itself does not recognize or allow negotiated contracts.</p>

<p class=BODY>However, the majority opinion posits the view that since only
private respondent EDSA LRT was prequalified, then a public bidding would be
&quot;an absurd and pointless exercise.” I submit that the mandatory
requirement of public bidding cannot be legally dispensed with simply because
only one was qualified <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>to </span>bid
during the prequalification proceedings.  Section 5 mandates that the BOT or BT contract should be awarded
&quot;to the lowest complying bidder,&quot; which logically means that there
must at least be two (2) bidders.  If
this minimum requirement is not met, then the proposed bidding should be deferred
and a new prequalification proceeding be scheduled.  Even those who were earlier disqualified may by then have
qualified because they may have, in the meantime, exerted efforts to meet all
the qualifications.<b><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=BODY>This view of the majority would open the floodgates to the
rigging of prequalification proceedings or to unholy conspiracies <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>among </span>prospective bidders, which would
even include dishonest government officials.  They could just agree, for a certain consideration, that only one of
them would qualify in order that the latter would automatically corner the
contract and obtain the award.</p>

<p class=BODY>That section 5 admits of no exception and that no bidding could
be validly had with only one bidder is likewise conclusively shown by the
amendments introduced by R.A. No. 7718.  Per section 7 thereof, a new section denominated as Section 5-A was
introduced in R.A. No. 6957 to allow direct negotiation of contracts.  This new section reads:<span
style='font-size:4.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>SEC. 5-A.<i> Direct Negotiation of Contracts. </i>&#8209; Direct
negotiation shall be resorted to when there is only one complying bidder left
as defined hereunder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)  If, after advertisement, only one
contractor applies for prequalification requirements, after which it is
required to submit a bid/proposal which is subsequently found by the agency/local
government unit (LGU) to be complying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)  If, after prequalification, more than one
contractor submit bids but only one is found by the agency/LGU to be
complying:  <i>Provided,</i> That, any
of the disqualified prospective bidder may appeal the decision of the
implementing agency/LGUs prequalification bids and awards committee within
fifteen (15) working days to the head of the agency, in case of national
projects or to the Department of the Interior and Local Government, in case of
local projects from the date the disqualification was made known to the
disqualified bidder:  <i>Provided, </i>furthermore,
That the implementing agency/LGUs concerned should act on the appeal within
forty-five (45) working days from receipt thereof.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Can this amendment be given retroactive effect to the challenged
contract so that it may now be considered a permissible negotiated contract? I
submit that it cannot be.  R.A. No. 7718
does not provide that it should be given retroactive effect to pre-existing
contracts.  Section 18 thereof says that
it &quot;shall take effect fifteen (15) days after its publication in at least
two (2) newspapers of general circulation.&quot; If it were the intention of
Congress to give said act retroactive effect then it would have so expressly
provided.  Article 4 of the Civil Code
provides that &quot;[l]aws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the
contrary is provided.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>The presumption is that all laws operate prospectively, unless
the contrary clearly appears or is clearly, plainly, and unequivocally
expressed or necessarily implied.  In
every case of doubt, the doubt will be resolved against the retroactive
application of laws.  (Ruben E. Agpalo,
STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION 225 [2d ed. 1990]).  As to amendatory acts, or acts which change an existing statute,
Sutherland states:</p>

<blockquote>In accordance with the rule applicable to original acts, it is
presumed that provisions added by the amendment affecting substantive rights
are intended to operate prospectively.  Provisions added by the amendment that affect substantive rights will
not be construed to apply to transactions and events completed prior to its enactment
unless the legislature has expressed its intent to that effect or such intent
is clearly implied by the language of the amendment or by the circumstances
surrounding its enactment.  (1 Frank E.
Horack, Jr., SUTHERLAND'S STATUTES AND STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION 434-436 [1943
ed.]).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY><b>I vote then to grant the instant petition and to declare void
the challenged contract and its supplement.</b><b><span style='font-size:9.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=OTHERHEADING>DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class=DISSENTINGCONCURRING>FELICIANO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class=BODY>After considerable study and effort, and with much reluctance, I
find I must dissent in the instant case.  I agree with many of the things set out in the majority opinion written by
my distinguished brother in the Court Quiason, <u>J</u>.  At the end of the day, however, I find
myself unable to join <u>in the result</u> reached by the majority.</p>

<p class=BODY>I join in the dissenting opinion written by Mr. Justice Davide,
Jr. which is appropriately drawn on fairly narrow grounds.  At the same time, I wish to address briefly
one of the points made by Mr. Justice Quiason in the majority opinion in his
effort to meet the difficulties posed by Davide, Jr., <u>J</u>.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=BODY>I refer to the invocation of the provisions of Presidential
Decree No. 1594 dated 11 June 1978 entitled:  &quot;Prescribing Policies, Guidelines, Rules and Regulations for
Government Infrastructure Contracts.&quot; More specifically, the majority
opinion invokes paragraph 1 of Section 4 of this Degree which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 4.  <u>Bidding</u>.  &#8213; Construction projects shall
generally be undertaken by contract after competitive public bidding.  Projects may be undertaken by administration
or force account or by negotiated contract only in exceptional cases where time
is of the essence, or where there is lack of qualified bidders or contractors,
or where there is a conclusive evidence that greater economy and efficiency
would be achieved through this arrangement, and in accordance with provisions
of laws and acts on the matter, subject to the approval of the Ministry of
Public Works, Transportation and Communications, the Minister of Public
Highways, or the Minister of Energy, as the case may be, if the project cost is
less than P1 Million, and of the President of the Philippines, upon the
recommendation of the Minister, if the project cost is P1 Million or more.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style='mso-tab-count:3'>                             </span>x
x x<span style='mso-tab-count:3'>                               </span>x x
x&quot;<span style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>I understand the unspoken theory in the majority opinion to be
that above Section 4 and presumably the rest of Presidential Decree No. 1594
continue to exist and to run parallel to the provisions of Republic Act No.
6957, whether in its original form or as amended by Republic Act No. 7718.<span
style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>A principal difficulty with this approach is that Presidential
Decree No. 1594 purports to apply to <u>all</u> &quot;government contracts for
infrastructure <u>and other</u> construction projects.&quot; But Republic Act
No. 6957 as amended by Republic Act No. 7718, relates <u>only</u> to
&quot;infrastructure projects&quot; which are <u>financed, constructed,
operated and maintained &quot;by the private sector</u>&quot; &quot;through the
<u>build/operate-and-transfer</u> or <u>build-and-transfer scheme</u>&quot;
under Republic Act No. 6597 and under a <u>series of other comparable schemes</u>
under Republic Act No. 7718.  In other
words, Republic Act No. 6957 and Republic Act No. 7718 must be held, in my
view, to be <u>special statutes</u> applicable to a more limited field of
&quot;infrastructure projects&quot; than the wide-ranging scope of application
of the <u>general statute</u>, i.e., Presidential Decree No. 1594.  Thus, the high relevance of the point made
by Mr. Justice Davide that Republic Act No. 6957 <u>in specific connection with
BOT- and BLT-type of contracts</u> imposed an <u>unqualified</u> requirement of
public bidding set out in Section 5 thereof.</p>

<p class=BODY>It should also be pointed out that under Presidential Decree No.
1594, projects may be undertaken &quot;by administration or force account or by
negotiated contract <u>only</u>&quot;<span style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1)  &quot;in exceptional
cases where time is of the essence;&quot; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)  &quot;where there is
lack of bidders or contractors;&quot; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) &quot;where there is a conclusive evidence that greater economy
and efficiency would be achieved through these arrangements, and in accordance
with provision[s] of laws and acts on the matter.&quot;<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>     </span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>It must, upon the one hand, be noted that the special law
Republic Act No. 6957 made absolutely <u>no mention of negotiated contracts</u>
being permitted to displace the requirement of public bidding.  Upon the other hand, Section 5-a, inserted
in Republic Act No. 6957 by the amending statute Republic Act No. 7718, does <u>not</u>
purport to authorize direct negotiation of contracts <u>except in four (4)
situations</u> where there is a lack of pre-qualified contractors or complying
bidders.  Thus, even under the amended
special statute, entering into contracts by negotiation is <u>not</u>
permissible in <u>the other two (2) categories of cases referred to in Section
4 of Presidential Decree No. 1594</u>, i.e., &quot;in exceptional cases where
time is of the essence&quot; and &quot;when there is conclusive evidence that
greater economy and efficiency would be achieved through these arrangements,
etc.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>The result I reach is that <u>insofar as BOT, etc.-types of
contracts</u> are concerned, the applicable public bidding requirement is that
set out in Republic Act No. 6957 and, <u>with respect to such type of contracts
opened for pre-qualification and bidding after the date of effectivity of
Republic Act No. 7718</u>, the provisions of Republic Act No. 7718.  The assailed contract was entered into
before Republic Act No. 7718 was enacted.</p>

<p class=BODY>The difficulties of applying the provisions of Presidential
Degree No. 1594 to the Edsa LRT-type of contracts are aggravated when one
considers the detailed &quot;Implementing Rules and Regulations as amended
April 1988&quot; issued under that Presidential Decree.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
For instance:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;IB [2.5.2] 2.4.2 <u>By Negotiated Contract</u> </blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style='mso-tab-count:3'>                             </span>x
x x<span style='mso-tab-count:3'>                               </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>a.  In times of emergencies
arising from natural calamities where immediate action is necessary to prevent
imminent loss of life and/or property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.  Failure to award the
contract <u>after competitive public bidding</u> for valid cause or causes
[such as where the prices obtained through public bidding are all above the AAE
and the bidders refuse to reduce their prices to the AAE].</blockquote>

<blockquote>In these cases, bidding may be undertaken through sealed canvass of
at least three (3) qualified contractors.  Authority to negotiate contracts for projects under these exceptional
cases shall be subject to prior approval by heads of agencies within their
limits of approving authority.<span style='font-size:13.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>c.  Where the subject
project is adjacent or contiguous to an on-going project and it could be
economically prosecuted by the same contractor provided that he has no negative
slippage and has demonstrated a satisfactory performance.&quot; (Emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>Note that there is no reference at all in
these Presidential Decree No. 1594 Implementing Rules and Regulations to
absence of pre-qualified applicants and bidders as justifying negotiation of
contracts as distinguished from requiring public bidding or a second public
bidding.</p>

<p class=BODY>Note also the following provision of the same Implementing Rules
and Regulations:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;IB 1 <u>Prequalification</u> </blockquote>

<blockquote>The <u>following may become contractors for government projects</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  <u>Filipino</u> </blockquote>

<p class=2Q>a.  Citizens (single
proprietorship)</p>

<p class=2Q>b.  Partnership or <u>corporation
duly organized under the laws of the Philippines, and at least seventy five percent
(75%) of the capital stock of which belongs to Filipino citizens</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>2. Contractors forming themselves into a joint venture, i.e., a
group of two or more contractors that intend to be jointly and severally
responsible for a particular contract, shall for purposes of bidding/tendering
comply with LOI 630, and, aside from being currently and properly accredited by
the Philippine Contractors Accreditation Board, shall comply with the
provisions of R.A. 4566, provided that <u>joint ventures in which Filipino ownership
is less than seventy five percent (75%) may be prequalified where the
structures to be built require the</u> application of <u>techniques and/or
technologies</u> which are <u>not adequately possessed by a Filipino entity as
defined above</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>[The foregoing shall not negate any existing and future commitments
with respect to the bidding and aware of contracts financed partly or wholly
with funds from international lending institutions like the Asian Development
Bank and the World Bank as well as from bilateral and other similar
sources.]&quot; (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The record of this case is entirely silent on the extent of
Philippine equity in the Edsa LRT Corporation; there is no suggestion that this
corporation is organized under Philippine law and is at least seventy-five
(75%) percent owned by Philippine citizens.</p>

<p class=BODY>Public bidding is the normal method by which a government keeps
contractors honest and is able to assure itself that it would be getting the
best possible value for its money in any construction or similar project.  It is not for nothing that multilateral
financial organizations like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
uniformly require projects financed by them to be implemented and carried out
by public bidding.  Public bidding is
much too important a requirement casually to loosen by a latitudinarian
exercise in statutory construction.</p>

<p class=BODY>The instant Petition should be granted and the challenged
contract and its supplement should be nullified and set aside.  A true public bidding, complete with a new prequalification
proceeding, should be required for the Edsa LRT Project.<span style='font-size:

<p class=OTHERHEADING>CONCURRING OPINION<span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=DISSENTINGCONCURRING>MENDOZA, <i>J</i>.:<span style='font-size:12.0pt;
color:black'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>I concur in all but Part III of the majority opinion.  Because I hold that petitioners do not have
standing to sue, I join to dismiss the petition in this case.  I write only to set forth what I understand the
grounds for our decisions on the doctrine of standing are and, why in
accordance with these decisions, petitioners do not have the right to sue,
whether as legislators taxpayers or citizens.  As members of Congress, because they allege no infringement of
prerogatives as legislators.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As taxpayers because petitioners allege neither an unconstitutional exercise of
the taxing or spending powers of Congress (Art. VI, §§24-25 and 29)<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
nor an illegal disbursement of public money.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
As this Court pointed out in <i>Bugnay Const. and Dev. Corp. v. Laron,</i><a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
a party suing as taxpayer “must specifically prove that he has sufficient
interest in preventing the illegal expenditure of money raised by taxation and
that he will sustain a direct injury as a result of the enforcement of the
questioned statute or contract.  It is
not sufficient that he has merely a general interest common to all members of
the public.” In that case, it was held that a contract, whereby a local
government leased property to a private party with the understanding that the
latter would build a market building and at the end of the lease would transfer
the building to the lessor, did not involve a disbursement of public funds so
as to give a taxpayer standing to question the legality of the contract.  I see no substantial difference, as far as
the standing of taxpayers to question public contracts is concerned, between
the contract there and the build-lease-transfer (BLT) contract being questioned
by petitioners in this case.</p>

<p class=BODY>Nor do petitioners have standing to bring this suit as
citizens.  In the cases<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
in which citizens were authorized to sue, this Court found standing because it
thought the constitutional claims pressed for decision to be of “transcendental
importance,” as in fact it subsequently granted relief to petitioners by
invalidating the challenged statutes or <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>governmental
</span>actions.  Thus in the Lotto case<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
relied upon by the majority for upholding petitioners' standing, this Court
took into account the “paramount public interest” involved which “immeasurably
affect[ed] the social, economic, and moral well-being of the people . . . and
the counter-productive and retrogressive effects of the envisioned on-line
lottery system.”<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the Court invalidated the contract for the operation of lottery.</p>

<p class=BODY>But in the case at bar, the Court precisely finds the opposite by
finding petitioners' substantive contentions to be without merit.  To the extent therefore that a party's
standing is affected by a determination of the substantive merit of the case or
a preliminary estimate thereof, petitioners in the case at bar must be held to
be without standing.  This is in line
with our ruling in <i>Lawyers League for a Better Philippines v. Aquino</i><a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and In re <i>Bermudez</i><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="#_ftn9"
name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>where we dismissed citizens’ actions on the ground that petitioners had no
personality to sue and their petitions did not state a cause of action.  The holding that petitioners did not have
standing followed from the finding that they did not have a cause of action.</p>

<p class=BODY>In order that citizens’ actions may be allowed a party must show
that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of
the allegedly illegal conduct of the government; the injury is fairly traceable
to the challenged action; and the injury is likely to be redressed by a
favorable action.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10' href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
As the U.S. Supreme Court has held:</p>

<blockquote>Typically, . . . the standing inquiry
requires careful judicial examination of a complaint's allegation to ascertain
whether the particular plaintiff is entitled to an adjudication of the
particular claims asserted.  Is the
injury too abstract, or otherwise not appropriate, to be considered judicially
cognizable? Is the line of causation between the illegal conduct and injury too
attenuated? Is the prospect of obtaining relief from the injury as a result of
a favorable ruling too speculative? These questions and any others relevant to
the standing inquiry must be answered by reference to the Art III notion that
federal courts may exercise power only “in the last resort, and as a
necessity,” Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R. Co. v. Wellman, 143 US 339, 345, 36 L
Ed 176, 12 S Ct 400 (1892), and only when adjudication is “consistent with a
system of separated powers and [the dispute is one] traditionally thought to be
capable of resolution through the judicial process,” Flast v Cohen, 392 US 83,
97, 20 L Ed 2d 947, 88 S Ct 1942 (1968).  See Valley Forge, 454 US, at 472-473, 70 L Ed 2d 700, 102 S Ct 752.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Today's holding that a citizen, <i>qua</i> citizen, has standing
to question a government contract unduly expands the scope of public actions
and sweeps away the case and controversy requirement so carefully embodied in
Art. VIII, §5 in defining the jurisdiction of this Court.  The result is to convert the Court into an
office of ombudsman for the ventilation of generalized grievances.  Consistent with the view that this case has
no merit I submit with respect that petitioners, as representatives of the
public interest, have no standing.<span style='font-size:9.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>
