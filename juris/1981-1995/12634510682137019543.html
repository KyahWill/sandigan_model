				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF, VS. HON. ANTONIO A. ORCULLO, AS ACTING CITY JUDGE OF CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, AND VENIDA PERALTA ALIAS EDAT PERALTA, RESPONDENTS.
<br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDEZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for certiorari filed by the City Fiscal and Assistant
 City Fiscal of Cagayan de Oro City praying that the order of the 
respondent Judge, Hon. Antonio A. Orcullo, dismissing Criminal Case No. 
40117 be set aside and that said case be ordered reinstated and tried on
 the merits.
<p>
The petition alleges that on September 4, 1978, a special counsel in the
 Office of the City Fiscal of Cagayan de Oro City filed an information 
with the City Court of Cagayan de Oro, Branch I, charging the respondent
 Venida Peralta alias Edat Peralta with oral defamation committed as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about August 17, 1978, at 7:00 o'clock in the evening,
 at Gumamela Extension Street, Carmen, Cagayan de Oro City, Philippines,
 and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, with deliberate intent to cast undue shame, public ridicule, 
discredit, disrepute and contempt against one Lydia Flores, did then and
 there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously speak and shouted the 
following words towards the latter:  'Hostess ug nangabit, bisan unsa 
lang oten and nakapaslak; which approximately means in English:  'A 
hostess and has a paramour, any kind of penis had penetrated your 
vagina,' or words of similar import, directed to the said Lydia Flores, 
in the presence and with the hearing of many people, well-knowing that 
what she uttered were not only defamatory but downright false, causing 
the offended party by said utterance to suffer undue shame, public 
ridicule, disrepute, discredit and contempt, to the great damage and 
prejudice of the said Lydia Flores. </p>
  <p> “Contrary to Article 358 of the Revised Penal Code. </p>
  <p> “Cagayan de Oro City, September 1, 1978. </p>
  <p> “(SGD) EFREN L. LAMPIOS </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Special Counsel”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
which information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 40117; that on 
November 3, 1978, Criminal Case No. 40117 was set for arraignment and 
the accused-respondent pleaded not guilty; that on February 2, 1981, the
 accused-respondent filed a motion to quash on the ground that the crime
 alleged constituted an imputation of a crime which cannot be prosecuted
 de oficio; that on February 10, 1981, the respondent Judge, Hon. 
Antonio A. Orcullo, issued an order dismissing Criminal Case No. 40117 
on the ground that the offense alleged in the information is a private 
crime which can be instituted or filed only by the offended party; that 
on February 27, 1981, the City Fiscal filed a motion for reconsideration
 of the order dismissing Criminal Case No. 40117; and that on March 11, 
1981, the respondent judge denied the motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
In his comment filed on November 3, 1981, the private respondent 
contended that the wordings “Hostess and has a paramour, any kind of 
penis had penetrated your vagina” are in unequivocal terms and can be 
readily understood as imputing to the offended party the commission of 
the act of adultery, she being a married woman, hence the crime charged 
consists in the imputation of an offense which cannot be prosecuted de 
oficio and can be brought only upon complaint filed by the offended 
party as provided in paragraph 5, Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Solicitor General was required to comment on the petition and on the opposition of the accused.4
</p><p>
The pertinent portion of the comment of the Solicitor General filed on December 18, 1981 reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The main issue to be resolved is whether the derogatory remarks -
 'A hostess and has a paramour, any kind of penis had penetrated your 
vagina' - imputes adultery or prostitution.  Petitioner submits that the
 remarks impute prostitution rather than adultery.  The word 'hostess' 
has acquired a notorious connotation.  It has a peculiar reference to 
one who works in nightclubs and ministers to the pleasures of men for 
fee.  The expression 'any kind of penis had penetrated your vagina' 
definitely describes and only refers to the work of a prostitute, and 
not that of a mere adulteress. </p>
  <p> "It is alleged by accused-respondent that the remarks imputed 
adultery, because the word 'paramour' was mentioned, thereby implying 
complainant to be a married woman who was carrying on an affair with a 
man not her husband.  It must be pointed out that since the information 
does not allege the civil status of complainant as married, she should 
be presumed to be single, and therefore the remarks must be understood 
as imputing prostitution, and not adultery.  Assuming arguendo that 
complainant is married and that the remarks, while imputing acts of 
prostitution to her and in effect charged her with adultery, the 
information can still be filed without her complaint.  The case of 
People v. Hong Din Chu, 33 SCRA 199, 202 is in point. </p>
  <p>
  'As thus alleged, it is clear that, while the utterance in effect also
 imputed on her the commission of adultery, the offended party being a 
married woman, the disreputable conduct she was particularly charged 
with was the crime of prostitution, not adultery.  And it may be pointed
 out that prostitution and adultery are not one and the same thing; the 
first is a crime against public morals, committed by a woman, whether 
married or not, who, for money or profit, habitually indulges in sexual 
intercourse or lascivious conduct, whereas adultery is in the nature of a
 private offense committed by a married woman who shall have sexual 
intercourse with a man not her husband.  In short, the essential element
 in prostitution is not simply a woman's entering into marital relations
 with a man other than her husband, if she happens to be married, but 
the existence of pecuniary or financial gain as inducement to, or 
consideration for, that woman's engaging in sexual activities.  Thus, to
 call a married woman a prostitute is not merely to proclaim her an 
adulteress, a violator of her marital vows:  it is to charge her of 
having committed an offense against public morals, of moral degeneracy 
far exceeding that involved in the maintenance of adulterous relations.
  </p>
  <p>
  'It appearing from the recital of the information that the alleged 
defamatory remark by the accused specifically imputed upon the offended 
party the commission of prostitution, which is a public crime that can 
be prosecuted de officio, the information filed under the signature of 
the Assistant City Fiscal duly conferred jurisdiction upon the lower 
court to try the case.' (Underscoring supplied)
  </p>
  <p> "This ruling is a mere reiteration of previous pronouncements made
 by this Honorable Court in People v. Santos, 98 Phil. 111, and Mangila 
v. Lantin, 30 SCRA 82.  Still, for another reason, assuming arguendo 
that adultery which is a private crime, and prostitution which is a 
public crime, are both imputed to complainant, criminal action may still
 be instituted without her complaint because public interest, which is 
always paramount to private interest, so requires (People v. Yu, 1 SCRA 
199). </p>
  <p> "It must be noted that it is only when derogatory remarks clearly 
and categorically reflect the elements constituting adultery would the 
complaint for libel by the offended party be necessary to commence 
prosecution (People v. Padilla, 105 Phil. 45).  In this case, however, 
the derogatory remarks of accused-respondent, not only do not clearly 
show the elements of adultery, but on the contrary, such remarks 
indubitably impute the crime of prostitution.  Therefore, the 
information for libel can be filed without the complaint of the offended
 party."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The submission of the Solicitor General is well taken.  Indeed, the 
words quoted in the information are indubitably an imputation of the 
crime of prostitution which can be prosecuted <i>de oficio</i>.

<b>WHEREFORE, </b>the petition is granted, the order dismissing Criminal
 Case No. 40117 of the City Court of Cagayan de Oro City is set aside,
