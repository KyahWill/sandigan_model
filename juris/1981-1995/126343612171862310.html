				<BR><STRONG>GRIÑO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioners and intervenors who are permanent employees in the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) filed this petition for
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction and/or restraining order, to stop <span style="">the
respondents from removing them from their positions </span><span style="">in the DENR pursuant to the 1987
reorganization of that department under Executive Order No. 192 dated June 10,
1987.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To carry out said reorganization, and pursuant to Executive Order
No. 165 of May 5, 1987 which abolished the Commission on Government
Reorganization and trans­ferred its remaining functions<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> to
the Department of Budget and Management (DBM for brevity), DENR Secretary
Fulgencio S. Factoran, Jr. submitted to the DBM a staff­ing pattern consisting
of 28,106 positions.  The DBM approved only
22,956 positions and the petitioners’ positions were among those trimmed off
the new plantil<span style="">la.  As the lean plantilla did not meet the
manpower requirements of the DENR, Secretary Factoran submitted a staffing
pattern consisting of 24,614 positions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 4, 1988, the DBM released a revised staffing pattern
containing 23,612 positions only which was 1,002 positions less than what the
DENR Secretary requested and which still did not include the positions of the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 29, 1988, the DENR requested the DBM to restore 839
positions which DBM had disapproved earlier.  The request was approved on September 14, 1988 after long negotiations
between the DENR and DBM, subject to <span style="">the
condition that these positions shall be coterminous with the appointees but not
to exceed three (3) years.  The
implications of this are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1.  If the appointee desires to retire, resign,
transfer to other office or leave his employment for any reason whatsoever, the
position is automatically abolished, even if the three-year period has not
lapsed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  By the end of the 3rd year, the employee
holding a coterminous position is automatically separated.” (p. 7, Rollo.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on June 10, 1988, Republic Act No. 6656 “An Act to
Protect the Security of Tenure of Civil Service Officers and Employees In the
Implementation of Government Reorganization,” was passed.  Section 11 thereof orders all departments
and agencies to complete the 1987 reorganization of the executive branch within
ninety (90) days from the approval of the law, or on or before September 8,
1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">The directors of the affected bureaus (the Envi­ronmental
Management Bureau, Forestry Management Bureau, Parks and Wildlife Bureau, Mines
and Geosciences Bureau) requested the DENR and DBM Secretaries to convert the
coterminous positions to permanent.  The
DENR Secretary favorably endorsed their request citing changes in the functions
of the DENR as justification for the request (Annex B).  The request was reiterated by the DENR
Assistant Secretary for Services Management but it was denied on December 19,
1990 by DBM Secretary Guillermo Carague.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The DENR Secretary’s motion for reconsideration was not acted
upon by Secretary Carague.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the General Appropriations Act of FY 1991 (R.A. No.
7078) provided for the salaries of the coterminous employees in the DENR until
December 31, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 6, 1991, DENR Secretary Factoran submit­ted a
memorandum to President Aquino, through Executive Secretary Franklin Drilon,
requesting that the 597 coterminous positions of the DENR (which would expire
on September 15, 1991) be extended up to December 31, 1991,<span style=""> without prejudice to DBM’s action
on his (Secretary Factoran’s) motion for reconsideration.  The Office of the President granted the
request.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But as Secretary Factoran’s request for reconsid­eration of
Secretary Carague’s order remained unacted upon, the petitioners filed in this
Court on December 19, 1991, the present petition for prohibition<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and <i>mandamus</i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
with a prayer for the issuance of a restrain­ing order/preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grounds relied upon by the petitioners are:</p>

<blockquote>1.  That the impending mass dismissal of
petitioners from em­ployment on December 31, 1991 would violate their right to
security of tenure and the provisions of Repub­lic Act No. 6656;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  That the appointment of the petitioners to
the so-called coterminous positions deprived them of the right to due process;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  The creation of positions “coterminous with
the incumbent but not exceeding three years” is not in accordance with civil
service laws, rules and regulations; and<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Respondent DBM Secretary has no discretion
but to grant respondent DENR Secretary’s request for regularization of the
cotermi­nous positions.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the petition, the Court issued a temporary
restraining order directing the DENR Secretary to “cease and desist from
terminating the services of the petitioners effective December 31, 1991 and
from preventing them from performing their duties and functions as officials
and employees of the DENR corre<span style="">sponding
to their respective positions” (p. 51, Rollo).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1992, petitioners filed an “Urgent Motion to Cite
Respondents <span style="">for </span>Contempt” for
failure to pay their salaries, allowances and such other benefits due them
while they continue to perform their respective duties and responsibilities in
the DENR.  On March 2, 1992, petitioners
filed a Supplemental Motion for Con<span style="">tempt
on the ground that besides not paying their salaries, respondents made them
sign new appointments </span>making them “coterminous with the incumbent.”
These acts of the respondents allegedly violate the Restraining Order issued by
this Court on December 27, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Comment, the Office of the Solicitor Gener­al denied that
public respondents have violated the temporary restraining order.  Respondent DENR Secretary complied with the
TRO by not terminating the services of the petitioners.  Non-payment of the petitioners’ sal­aries
was due to the lack of an appropriation of funds for their salaries.  Besides, the TRO did not require <span style="">the DBM to appropriate funds for
their salaries.  The DBM did not violate
the TRO when it required petitioners </span>to sign new appointments making
their positions cotermi­nous with the incumbent for it (DBM) was not directed
by the TRO to desist from committing any act.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1992, Reynaldo Alcances, Marinela Cecilia T.
Pascua and Dolores T. Tolentino, through the petitioners’ counsel, asked to be
included as petition­ers because their names had been inadvertently omitted
from the list of petitioners.  Their
motion may be granted for they are similarly situated as the original
petitioners who have continued to work in the DENR beyond December 31, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 24, 1992, a Motion for Leave to Inter­vene was filed by
Conrado Salvador and Miguel Caisip which was not opposed by the
petitioners.  Before the Court could
grant them leave to intervene, they filed a complaint in Intervention on July
20, 1993.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 6, 1992, Alfredo S. Marchadesch, Jr. and Carolina S. Cavan
withdrew as petitioners because they had accepted new appointments in the DENR.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 13, 1992, the public respondents, through the Solicitor
General, filed their Comment on the peti­tion.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners argue that their dismissal on December 31, 1991,
would violate their right to security<span style=""> </span>of
tenure safeguarded by paragraph (3), Section 2 of Article IX-B of the
Constitution, and the 2nd paragraph, <span style="">Section
3 of Article XIII thereof.  They also
invoke Sections 1 and 11 of Republic Act No. 6656, which pro­vide that
“departments and agencies of the government have only ninety (90) days from the
approval of the Act to undertake the complete implementation of their
respective reorganization plan, hence, the DENR had only up to September 8,
1988, to reorganize.  </span><span style="">Their </span><span style="">dismissal on</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">December 31, 1991, goes beyond the
period allowed by law for the reorganization of the DENR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be recalled that upon her assumption of office as President
of the Philippines after the EDSA Revolution, President Corazon Aquino invested
herself under Sections 1 and 2, Article III of the Freedom Constitution
(Proclamation No. 3, March 25, 1986) with power and authority to reorganize the
Government “by proclamation or executive order or by designation or appointment
and qualification of the successor of any <span style="">elective and appointive officials under the 1973 Constitution.”
The reorganization was to be completed within one year from February 25, 1986,
or by February 25, 1987.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 1.  In the reorganiza­tion
of the government, priority shall be given to measures to promote economy,
efficiency, and the eradication of graft and corruption.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SEC. 2.  All elective and
appointive officials and employees under the 1973 Constitution shall continue
in office until otherwise provided by proclamation or executive order or upon
the designation or appointment and qualification of their successors, if such
is made <u>within</u> <u>a</u> <u>period</u> <u>of</u> <u>one</u> <u>year</u> <u>from</u>
<u>February</u> <u>25,</u> <u>1986</u>.” (Underscoring ours.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, “in order to obviate unnecessary <span style="">anxiety </span>and demoralization among the deserving officials <span style="">and </span>employees, particularly in the
Career Civil Service” arising from the reorganization of the government, the
President issued E.O. No. 17 <span style="">on </span>May
28, 1986 providing guidelines for the implementation of the reorganization “to
protect career civil servants whose qualifications <span style="">and performance meet the </span><span style="">standards </span><span style="">of service demanded by the new
Government, and to ensure that only those found corrupt, inefficient and
undeserving are separated from the government service.” The head of each
Ministry (now Department) was tasked to “see to it that the separation and
replacement of officers and employees is made only for justifiable reasons”
which are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 3.  The following
shall be the grounds for separation/re­placement of personnel:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.  Existence of a case for summary dismissal
pursuant to Sec­tion 40 of the Civil Service Law;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  Existence of a probable cause for violation
of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act as determined by the Ministry Head
concerned;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  Gross incompetence or inefficiency in the
discharge of functions;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.  Misuse of public office for partisan
political purposes;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.  Any other analogous ground showing that the
incumbent is unfit to remain in the service or his separation/replacement is in
the interest of the service.” (E.O. No. 17.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Excluded from the protection of E.O. No. 17 are:</p>

<blockquote>“Sec.<span style=""> </span>11.  This Executive Order shall not apply to
elective officials or those designated to replace them, presidential appoint­ees,
casual and contractual employees, or officials and employees removed pursuant
to disciplinary proceedings under the Civil Service Law and Rules, and to <u>those</u>
<u>laid</u> <u>off</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>result</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>reorganization</u>
<u>undertaken</u> <u>pursuant</u> <u>to</u> <u>Executive</u> <u>Order</u> <u>No.</u>
<u>5</u>.” (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the ratification of the 1987 Con­stitution by the
nation, the reorganization deadline in Proclamation No. 3 (February 25, 1987)
was advanced to February 2, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the security of tenure of government employees <span style="">is </span>protected by Section 2, subpar.
(3), Title B, Article IX of the 1987 Constitution, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 2.  (3) No officer or
employee of the civil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause
provided by law.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 16 of Article XVIII (Transitory
Provisions) of the Constitution still allows the separation of employ­ees “<u>not</u>
<u>for</u> <u>cause</u> but as a result of the reorganization <span style="">pursuant
to Proclamation No. 3 </span><span style="">x
x x </span><u><span style="">and</span></u><span style=""> <u>the</u>
<u>reorganiza­tion</u> <u>following</u> <u>the</u> <u>ratification</u> <u>of</u>
<u>this</u> <u>Constitution</u>.” Section 16 is quoted hereunder:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 16.  Career civil serv­ice
employees separated from the service not for cause but as a result of the
reorganization pursu­ant to Proclamation No. 3 dated March 25, 1986 and the <u>reorganiza</u>­<u>tion</u>
<u>following</u> <u>the</u> <u>ratification</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>Constitution</u>
shall be entitled to appropriate separation pay and to <span style="">retirement </span>and other benefits accruing to them under the laws of
general application in force at the time of their separation.  In lieu thereof, at the option of the
employees, they may be considered for employment in the Government or in any of
its subdivisions, instrumentalities, or agencies, including government-owned or
controlled corporations and their subsidiaries.  This provision also applies to career officers whose resignation,
tendered in line with the existing policy, had been accepted.” (Underscoring
ours.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">E.O. No. 192 dated June 10, 1987 “PROVIDING FOR THE
REORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES,
RENAMING IT THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES, AND FOR OTHER
PURPOSES” is a “reorganization following the ratifica­tion of this
Constitution.” Although impliedly sanc­tioned under Section 16 of the
Transitory Provisions of the 1987 Constitution, it must nevertheless pass the <span style="">test of good faith to </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">valid.  Good faith, we ruled in Dario vs. Mison</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is a basic ingredient for the
validity of any government reorganization.  It is the golden thread that holds together the fabric of the
reorganization.  Without it, the cloth
would disintegrate.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“<u>Reorganization</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>recog­nized</u> <u>valid</u>
<u>ground</u> <u>for</u> <u>separation</u> <u>of</u> <u>civil</u> <u>service</u>
<u>employees,</u> <u>subject</u> <u>only</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>condition</u>
<u>that</u> <u>it</u> <u>be</u> <u>done</u> <u>in</u> <u>good</u> <u>faith</u>.  No less than the Constitution itself in Section
16 of the Transitory Provisions, together with Sections 33 and 34 of Executive
Order No. 81 and Section 9 of Republic Act No. 6656, support this conclusion
with the declaration that all those not so appointed in the implementation of
said reorgani­zation shall be deemed separated from the service with the
concomitant recognition of their entitlement to appropriate separation benefits
and/or retirement plans of the reorganized government agency.” (Domingo vs.
Development Bank of the Phils., 207 SCRA 766.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A reorganization in good faith is one designed to trim the fat
off the bureaucracy and institute economy and greater efficiency in its
operation.  It is not a mere tool of the
spoils system to change the face of the bureaucracy and destroy the livelihood
of hordes of career employees in the civil service so that the new?powers-that-be
may put their own people in control of the <span style="">machinery of government.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“<u>Reorganizations</u> <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> <u>this</u> </span><u>jurisdiction</u> <u><span style="">have</span></u><span style=""> <u>been</u> </span><u>regarded</u> <u><span style="">as</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>valid</u>
<u>provided</u> <u>they</u> <u><span style="">are</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>pursued</u> <u>in</u> <u>good</u> <u>faith.</u>  <u>As</u> <u>a</u> <u>general</u> <u>rule,</u>
<u>a</u> <u>reorganization</u> <u>is</u> <u>carried</u> <u>out</u> <u>in</u> <u>‘good</u>
<u>faith’</u> <u>if</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>purpose</u>
<u>of</u> <u>economy</u> <u>or</u> <u>to</u> <u>make</u> <u>bureauc­racy</u> <u>more</u>
<u>efficient</u>.  In that event, no
dismissal (in case of dismissal) or separation actually occurs be­cause the
position itself ceases to exist.  And in
that case, security of tenure would not be a Chinese wall.  Be that as it may, if the ‘abolition,’ which
is nothing else but a separation or removal, is done for political reasons or
purposely to defeat security of tenure, or otherwise not in good faith, no
valid ‘abolition’ takes place and whatever ‘abolition’ is done, is <span style="">void <u>ab</u>
<u>initio</u>.  <u>There</u> <u>is</u> <u>an</u>
<u>invalid</u>  <u>‘abolition’</u> <u>as</u>
<u>where</u> <u>there</u> <u>is</u> <u>merely</u> <u>a</u> <u>change</u> <u>of</u>

<u>of</u> <u>economy</u> <u>are</u> <u>belied</u> <u>the</u> <u>existence</u> <u>of</u>
<u>ample</u> <u>funds</u>.” (Dario vs. Mison, 176 SCRA 84, 92-93.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“There
is no dispute over the power to reorganize - whether traditional, progressive,
or whatever adjective is appended to it.  Howev­er, the essence of constitutional </span>government is adherence

<p class="BODY">There appears to be no sufficient justification for the
reorganization of the DENR, as revised by the DBM.  The fact that Section 25 of E.O. No. 192 changed the status of
all the officers and employees of the DENR from permanent or regular to mere
“hold-overs,” flagrantly violating the employees’ right to due process, taints
the reorganization process.  Section 25
provides:</p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 25.  New Structure and
Pattern.  - Upon approval of this
Executive Order, <u>the</u> <u>officers</u> <u>and</u> <u>employees</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Department</u> <u>shall</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>hold-over</u> <u>capacity,</u>
<u>continue</u> <u>to</u> <u>perform</u> <u>their</u> <u>respective</u> <u>duties</u>
<u>and</u> <u>responsibilities</u> and receive the corresponding salaries and
benefits unless in the meantime they are separated from government service.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x <u>Those</u> <u>incumbents</u> <u>whose</u> <u>positions</u>
<u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>included</u> <u>therein,</u> <u>or,</u> <u>who</u> <u>are</u>
<u>not</u> <u>reappointed,</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>deemed</u> <u>separated</u>
<u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>service</u>.  x x x.”<b><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Domingo</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>DBP</u>, 207 SCRA 766, the Court
emphasized that a reorganization “does not justify a detrac­tion from the <u>mandatory</u>
requirement of notice and hearing” (underlining ours) to the affected officials
and employees.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Section 2 of Republic Act No. 6656 provides that ‘no officer or
employee in the career service shall be removed except for a valid cause and
after due notice and hearing.’ thus, there is no question that <u>while</u> <u>dismissal</u>
<u>due</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> <u>reorganization</u> <u>is</u>
<u>recognized</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>valid</u> <u>cause,</u> <u>this</u> <u>does</u>
<u>not</u> <u>justify</u> <u>a</u> <u>detraction</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>mandatory</u>
<u>requirement</u> <u>of</u> <u>notice</u> <u>and</u> <u>hearing</u>.  x x x.” (Emphasis supplied; Domingo vs.
Development Bank of the Philippines, 207 SCRA 766.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Mendoza vs. Quisumbing, 186 SCRA 108, the Court noted the
pernicious effect of the “hold-over” provision (Sec. 24) in Executive Order No.
117 reorganizing the Department of Education and Culture which uprooted
thousands of school teachers and employees, thus:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x x x Pursuant to the above provision [Sec. 24, E.O. No. 117],
around 400,000 school teachers, janitors, clerks, principals, supervisors,
administrators, and higher officials were placed on ‘hold-over status.’ When a
public officer is placed on hold-over status, it means that his term has
expired or his services terminated but he should continue holding his office
until his successor is appointed or chosen and has qualified.  (See Topacio Nueno vs. Angeles, 76 Phil. 12
[1946]).” (Mendoza vs. Quisumbing, 186 SCRA 108, 110-111.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That the reorganization of the DENR was not intended to achieve
economy and efficiency, is revealed by the admission in page 16 of the public
respondents’ Comment that the new staffing pattern of the department contains “<u>991</u>
<u>positions</u> <u>more</u> than the total number of permanent positions in
the DENR before the reorganiza<span style="">tion.” In fact, DENR Secretary Fulgencio
Factoran (who is presumed to know better than anyone else the needs of </span>his
department) had urged the DBM <u>to</u> <u>restore</u> <u>the</u> <u>positions</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>petitioners</u> <u>because</u> <u>they</u> <u>are</u> <u>“vital</u>
to the functions, mandates and objectives of the DENR” (p. 30, Comment).  Since the abolition of their positions will
not conduce to either “efficiency” or “economy” in the Service, which are the
principal justifications for any government overhaul, then, obviously, the
reorganization of the DENR is not justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conversion of the petitioners from permanent to “coterminous”
employees is a wholesale <u>demotion</u> of personnel which is tantamount to
removal without cause and without due process.” (Floreza vs. Ongpin, 182 SCRA
692, 693.) It is therefore null and void.<b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
GRANTED.  The removal of the petitioners
and intervenors from office is declared null and void.  The respondent Secre­tary of the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), or his successor in office, is
ordered to reinstate the petitioners to their former or equiva­lent positions
in the DENR without loss <span style="">of </span>seniority
and other benefits, and to issue regular and permanent appointments to them for
the positions in the new organization and staffing pattern corresponding to
their positions in the 1986 plantilla.  The respondent Secre­tary of the Department of Budget and Management, or
his successor in office, is ordered to reinstate the appro­priation for the
salaries of the petitioners and inter­venors.  The temporary restraining order which the Court issued in this case is
made permanent.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners’ motion to cite the public respondents for
