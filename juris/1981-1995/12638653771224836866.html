<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span>
and Maria <span class="SpellE">Beldad</span>, owned a 16.8716 hectare parcel of
land at <span class="SpellE">Cagmanaba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, surveyed in the
name of <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span> under
Plan Psu-61453 (Exhibit “2”).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
death of Maria <span class="SpellE">Beldad</span> in 1925, the eastern half
thereof was given to <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span>,
their only d<span style="">a</span>ughter, and when <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span> died in 1943, the
1/2 portion pertaining to him was divided into three:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>one third to <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Prila</span>, one third to Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span>
and the other one-third to <span class="SpellE">Custodia</span> <span class="SpellE">Parcia</span>, as reflected in the Extra-judicial Settlement of
Estate executed on November 22, 1945.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the terms of said settlement, 4/6 of the entire land or 11.2477
hectares was adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span>, 1/6 or 2.8119 hectares to Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span> and another 1/6 or 2.8119 hectares to <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Parcia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This stipulation was reiterated by both <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span> and Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span> in an agreement dated <st1:date year="1947" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1947</st1:date> duly registered with the Register

THAT ONLY ONE-THIRD (1/3) OF THE PRODUCE "WENT TO" THE PLAINTIFF
(RAMOS), TWO-THIRDS (2/3) BEING FOR HIS TENANT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition <span style="">is </span>impressed
with merit.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that the land in question is part of the bigger mass
of land measuring 16.8716 hectares originally owned by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Beldad</span>, and that this mass of land was adjudicated among
the heirs <span style="">in </span>the proportion
aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that <span class="SpellE">Dichoso</span> derived his <span style="">title
</span>from <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Prila</span></span><span style=""> </span>while Ramos acquired his title from Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dichoso</span> contends that <span style="">his </span>claim is limited to 11.2477
hectares portion sold to him <span style="">by </span><span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span> which is exactly
four-sixth (4/6) of the 16.8716 hectares originally owned by their common
predecessor-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos acquired <span style="">his </span>title from Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span>, who inherited one-sixth (1/6) of the 16.8716
hectares mass of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the
share of Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span> is limited to one sixth
(1/6) of the 16.8716 hectares, or 2.8119 hectares, she cannot legally transmit
to Ramos an area in excess thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ramos, on the other hand, argues that while it is <span style="">true </span>that Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara's</span>
share is one-sixth (1/6) pursuant to the Extra-Judicial Settlement Agreement,
but on a subsequent agreement (Exhibit "13"), <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Prila</span> ceded to Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span>
one hectare more located <span style="">on </span>the
northern portion of the land covered by Original Certificate of Title No.
1176.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span> owns at least <span style="">six </span>(6) hectares of land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the Deed of Conveyance was registered on <st1:date year="1948" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1948</st1:date> and the property has
been declared for tax purposes in the name of Ramos’ wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Above all these, the question raised by <span class="SpellE">Dichoso</span> is purely a question of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show, however, that the one hectare ceded by <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span> to Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span> on the northern portion of the land supposed to be
covered by Original Certificate of Title No. 1176, is not the same land covered
by said Original Certificate of Title (Original Exhibits, Exhibit
"3", p. 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, <span style="">while </span>it may be true that Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Pacamara</span> may have <span style="">been
</span>adjudicated <span style="">a total of </span>six
(6) hectares of land, but what is covered by Original Certificate of Title No.
1176 pursuant to the Extra<span style="">-</span>Judicial
Settlement Agreement and the agreement subsequent thereto insofar as <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila's</span> share is
concerned, remains to be one-sixth (1/6) or 2.8119 hectares (Original Exhibits,
Exhibit 3", p. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">The striking similarities in the boundaries between the parcel of
land in dispute and the property of Ramos’ wife, particularly the boundaries on
the North, which is the dam, and on the East, which is the <span class="SpellE">Cagmanaba</span>
River, and the fact that the deed of sale in favor of Ramos’ wife was executed
and registered ahead of that <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Dichoso's</span> deed <span style="">of
sale, </span>led the trial court to conclude that the property in dispute
tallies with the land bought by Ramos’ wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be pointed out, however, that the deed of sale in favor of
Ramos’ wife explicitly described the property as being bounded "on the
South (by) heirs of <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span>
and Mariano Rodriguez, limited by an irrigation ditch, measuring 200 meters; on
the West (by) heirs of <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Prila</span>,
limited by a big stone, measuring 350 meters." The commissioner's report
(Exhibit "11") identified the land claimed by Ramos and indicated in
the sketch as the portion surrounded by a red line inside Lot-3, the portion
pertaining to <span class="SpellE">Dichoso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As indicated in the said sketch the <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dischoso</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
is <span class="SpellE">labelled</span> as Lots-1 and 3 and the portion <span class="SpellE">labelled</span> as Lot-2 is the <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Ramos</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A further scrutiny of Exhibit "11"
shows that the area being claimed by Ramos, which was enclosed by a red line,
went beyond the irrigation ditch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is contrary to the technical description in the deed of sale in favor of Ramos’
wife as to the boundary on the southern portion of the property (Original
Exhibits, Exhibit "11").<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the jurisdiction of this Court in cases brought from the
Court of Appeals is limited to the review of errors of law, said appellate
court’s finding of facts being conclusive, there are exceptions, among which
are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) when the conclusion is a
finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures; (2) when the
inference made is manifestly absurd, mistaken, or impossible; (3) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; (4) when the judgment is
premised on a misapprehension of facts; (5) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Cement, Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>,
135 SCRA 15, February 28, <span style="">1985).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has held that in cases of conflict between areas and
boundaries, it is the latter which should prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What really defines a piece of ground is not
the area, calculated with more or less certainty, mentioned in its description,
but the boundaries therein laid down, as enclosing the land and indicating its
limits (<span class="SpellE">Erico</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Chigas</span>, 98
SCRA 575, July 16, 1980).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a contract
of sale of land in a mass, it is well established that the specific boundaries
stated in the contract must control over any statement with respect to the area
contained within its boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not of vital consequence that a deed or contract of sale of land should disclose
the area with mathematical accuracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is sufficient if its extent is objectively indicated with sufficient precision
o enable one to identify it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An error as
to the superficial area is immaterial (Loyola v. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
39 Phil. 544, January <span style="">24, </span>1919
reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Erico</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Chigas</span>,
<u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With reference to the
second error, petitioner alleged that since respondent's share of the harvest
is only one-third (1/3), the remaining two-thirds (2/3) representing his
tenant's share, only the one-third (1/3) of the annual harvest must be awarded
to Ramos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ramos, on the other hand,
argues that his tenant will be deprived of his share if only one-third (1/3) </span>of
the harvest will be awarded to him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Actual or compensatory
damages cannot be presumed, but must be duly proved, and proved with reasonable
degree of certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A court cannot rely
on speculation, conjecture or guesswork as to the fact and amount of damages,
but must depend upon competent proof that they have suffered and on evidence of
the actual amount thereof (Dee <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> Electrical Corporation v. Reyes, 145 SCRA 713,
November 25, 1986).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is undisputed that the
land in question yields an average of twenty (20) sacks of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
per planting and that it is planted to <span class="SpellE">palay</span> twice a
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos’ share of the harvest </span>is
only <span style="">one-third (1/3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of his dispossession from 1964 and
the fact that his tenant has vacated the land that same year (TSN; Hearing of
February 10, 1971, pp. 2-3), he cannot allege that his tenant is entitled to his
two-thirds </span>(2/3) share.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby
SET ASIDE and the area of the land awarded to herein respondent Ramos is hereby
LIMITED to 2.8119 hectares in accordance with the boundaries indicated in the
deed of sale in favor of his wife, and the award of actual damages is hereby
REDUCED in proportion to the area that may be awarded to Ramos and to his
one-third (1/3) participation in the harvests, from 1964 up to the time the
land appurtenant thereto is returned to the respondent.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
