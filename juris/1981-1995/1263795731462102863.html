granting power to the municipal mayor to conduct preliminary investigations and
order the arrest of the accused, was repealed by the 1985 Rules on Criminal
Procedure promulgated by this Court; and is, in addition, unconstitutional as
vesting the power to conduct preliminary investigations in an official who
cannot be deemed a <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"neutral and
detached magistrate"</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>within
the contemplation of Section 3, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue is hereby resolved adversely to the
petitioners, with the stressed qualification that the mayor's power to order
arrest ceased to exist as of February 2, 1987 when the new Constitution was
ratified by the Filipino people, and that, in any event, the investigation
actually conducted by respondent mayor in the case at bar was fatally
defective.</p>

first, of water spewed from fire hoses, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and

Lumayno, in view of the absence of the Municipal Circuit Court Judge (Emilio
Ignalaga), took cognizance of a complaint filed by the Military Station
Commander charging some of the rallyists with the felony of inciting to
sedition, and after avowedly conducting an investigation of the witnesses
presented by the complainant, issued an order for the arrest of certain of the
demonstrators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His order reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that the Presiding Municipal Circuit Court
Judge, Hon. Emilio M. Ignalaga, is on official leave of absence and, in the
interest of justice, the undersigned has to urgently act on the complaint filed
by the Station Commander, against the above-named accused for 'INCITING TO
SEDITION' and, on the basis of the evidence submitted after a searching
question and answer were conducted and, being satisfied that said crime has
been committed, in order not to frustrate the ends of justice, it is necessary
that the above-named accused be placed under custody.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let therefore, a warrant of arrest be issued

<p class="BODY">The gist of the testimony of Capt. Sanson and the other affiants
is that on September 20, 1985, the demonstrators, numbering "about
1,000", had blockaded the main highway in front of the Escalante Municipal
Building, by massing themselves on the road as well as by piling stones,
coconut trunks and pieces of wood in the middle of the highway.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were also "shouting invectives,
seditious and scurrilous words against the government." Negotiations with
Ponsica, Chairman of the Escalante Chapter of "BAYAN" (Bagong
Alyansang Makabayan), to have the road cleared having been unavailing, firemen
on firetrucks began to train a "torrent of water" from their fire
hoses on the demonstrators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
rallyists retaliated by hurling stones at the firemen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of them "approached the security of
the firetruck and stabbed him." Others climbed aboard the trucks and tried
to grab the firehoses and firearms of the officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point, on Capt. Sanson's orders, his
"back­up teams" of soldiers commenced to throw tear gas at the
crowd.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the demonstrators picked
up a tear gas canister and hurled it back at the soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time gunfire from "different
assorted firearms" emanated from the rallyists; and some of the shots hit
the blinker of a firetruck and the headlight of another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The soldiers shot back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This exchange of gunfire resulted in
"fourteen (14) demonstrators killed on the spot." Recovered at the
scene were a rifle; a U.S. 45 cal. pistol; 2 "homemade" pistols; 14
steel arrows and 4 assorted slings; 30 assorted knives; a "<i>pogakhang</i>"
with 2 live cartridges; 2 grenades; and several empty shells of different
caliber.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hours later, another corpse,
identified as that of a demonstrator, too, was brought to the PC Headquarters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners however give a different version of the
facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What happened, according to them,
was that at 9 o'clock in the morning on that day, a group of demonstrators,
"composed mostly of laid-off sugar field workers," gathered in front
of Escalante Municipal Hall "in the exercise of their constitutionally
guaranteed right to freedom of expression and to assemble peacefully to
petition the government for redress of grievances".<a style="mso-footnote-id:

About an hour afterwards; fire trucks arrived one after another, as well as
jeeploads of soldiers and CHDF members, in full combat gear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>,
after "going thru the motions of negotiating with the demonstrators,"
the military officers ordered the crowd to disperse; but without warning, fire
hoses were trained on and sprayed water at the demonstrators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the rallyists did not budge, tear gas
canisters were thrown at them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
demonstrator picked up a canister and threw it at an "empty space in the
plaza" The soldiers and CHDF members thereupon fired indiscriminately at
the crowd, killing 29 and injuring at least 30 persons.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">After the Mayor had referred the case to Municipal Trial Court
Judge Ignalaga on September 24, 1985,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
an "URGENT MOTION TO QUASH WARRANT OF ARREST" was filed on September
26, 1985 by petitioners' counsel on the ground that a mayor no longer has
authority to conduct preliminary investigations or issue warrants of arrest
that authority having been "withheld in the 1985 New Rules on Criminal
Procedure."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
This was opposed by the Station Commander<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
who invoked Section 143 of the Local Government Code providing that "(i)n
case of temporary absence of the Judge assigned to the municipality, the mayor
may conduct the preliminary examination in criminal cases when, in his opinion
the investigation cannot be delayed without prejudice to the interest of
justice." A reply was filed by the petitioners after their receipt of the
opposition "only last <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="10">October 8,
 1985</st1:date>".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
They contended that the "power of the municipal mayor to conduct
preliminary investigation and issue a warrant of arrest under the 1964 Revised
Rules of Court ** (had been) impliedly repealed by the 1985 New Rules on
Criminal Procedure"; that "the 1985 New Rules on Criminal Procedure
being a special law, controls over provisions of the Local Government Code (BP
337, 1983), which is a general law"; and in any case, "subject
warrants of arrest should be reviewed and revoked as done without observance of
legal requisites."</p>

<p class="BODY">By Resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="10">Oct
 11, 1985</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the Judge confirmed the mayor's arrest order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He opined that in the absence of the judge, the mayor still has
authority to conduct preliminary investigations and issue arrrest warrants,
since Rule 112, Sec. 2 (d), of the 1985 Rules, includes as among those
authorized to conduct preliminary investigations, "Such other officers as may
be authorized by law"; and the Local Government Code of 1983, Section 143,
grants a town mayor authority to conduct preliminary examinations in case of
the temporary absence of the judge when such investigation cannot be delayed
without prejudice to the interest of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Judge declared that in the case at bar, the mayor had conducted the
examination personally, and having in the exercise of his discretion found
probable cause, issued the warrants of arrest in question; and conceding <i>arguendo</i>
irregularity in that the preliminary examination was conducted without
according the parties the assistance of lawyers (contrary to par. 2, Sec 143,
Chap. 3, Title 2, Book II, Local Government Code), this does not render the
proceedings void because at any rate, the mayor had duly observed the uniform
procedure under PD 91 (citing:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Peo v.

"in case of temporary absence of both the municipal and the auxiliary
municipal judges from the municipality, town or place wherein they exercise their
jurisdiction, to make the preliminary examination in criminal cases when such
examination cannot be delayed without prejudice to the interest of
justice," that power has been removed from him by the 1985 New Rules on
Criminal Procedure which "do not mention the Municipal Mayor as among the

cannot be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However superior
the Supreme Court may be to the other branches of government in the realm of

It is true that the 1935 Constitution repealed all procedural laws then in
force "as statutes" and declared them to be "rules of
court"; but this was only so that they could be subject to repeal or
modification by the Supreme Court, which was given the power to promulgate
rules of procedure,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
and has since been exercising such power by promulgating the Rules of Court of
1940 and of 1964, and the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions
explicitly conferred on the legislature the power to repeal, alter or
supplement those rules of court, although it would appear that that power is no
longer granted to it by the 1987 Charter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Now, the conditions under which the mayor could conduct
preliminary investigations are also clearly indicated by the law, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUM">1) in case of the temporary absence of the judge assigned to the
municipality; and</p>

<p class="NUM">2) in his (the mayor's) opinion, the investigation cannot be

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">On these occasions, the mayor may order

examination of the complainant and the witnesses the latter may present.</p>

the petitioners have not put the fulfilment of those conditions at issue at

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also challenge the constitutionality of Section
143 of the Local Government Code, it being claimed that the mayor has been
thereby authorized to conduct preliminary investigations and issue warrants of
arrest, although he can not be deemed a "neutral and detached magistrate"
within the contemplation of Section 3, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn52" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The competence of the <i>Batasang Pambansa</i> to decide and
declare by statute which "responsible officers", aside from judges,
should be entrusted with the authority to conduct preliminary investigations
and issue arrest warrants cannot be doubted in view of the clear language of
the Constitution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn53" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
And the determination by the <i>Batasan</i> that a municipal mayor is one such
"responsible officer" who may properly be entrusted with the function
of conducting preliminary investigations and ordering arrests of suspects upon
probable cause, can not be subject of judicial review, absent any indication
that the legislative proceedings leading to that statutory determination are
void on account of some grave cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, the wisdom of the statute, or the validity of the reasons
underlying it, or the adequacy of the statistics, facts and circumstances
considered by the legislature in its enactment, are beyond the sphere of
inquiry of the courts.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn54" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
The <i>Batasan</i> was apparently of the belief that a municipal mayor could be
sufficiently objective and impartial as to be relied upon to conduct
preliminary investigations and issue orders of arrest in the <b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">exceptional</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>situation when the judge assigned in the municipality was
absent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contend that the mayor cannot in the
very nature of things be "neutral and detached." The disagreement,
and the fact that plausible reasons may be adduced by one side or the other on
the proposition does not make the question a justiciable one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The theory advocated by the petitioners that
the mayor's "deep involvement in law enforcement functions is likely to
color his judgment as a trier of probable cause",<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn55" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
does not induce persuasion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first
place the premise cannot be conceded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that the mayors do "exercise general supervision
over units and elements of the INP stationed or assigned in their respective
jurisdictions," they are not themselves directly involved in police work
and cannot in any sense be described, as the petitioners do, as being deeply
involved in law enforcement functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And even if that "deep involvement" be conceded, it does not
follow that this would necessarily preclude their assuming "the cold neutrality
of an impartial judge" in conducting preliminary investigations of persons
suspected of crimes.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it must be emphasized here and now that what has just been
described is the state of the law as it was in <i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">September, 1985</span></u></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><b>The law has since been

Local Government Code, conferring this power on the mayor has been abrogated,
rendered <i>functus</i> <i>officio</i> by the 1987 Constitution which took
effect on <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1987</st1:date>,
the date of its ratification by the Filipino people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 2, Article <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to
be determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or
affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and
particularly describing the place to be searched and the person or things to be
seized." The constitutional proscription has thereby been manifested that
thenceforth, the function of determining probable cause and issuing, on the
basis thereof, warrants of arrest or search warrants, may be validly exercised
only by judges, this being evidenced by the elimination in the present
Constitution of the phrase, "such other responsible officer as may be
authorized by law" found in the counterpart provision of said 1973

<p class="BODY">As the law now stands, the mayor may no longer conduct

assistants; (2) judges of the Municipal Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' assault, on the other hand, upon the
constitutionality of Article 141 of the Revised Penal Code, defining and
penalizing the felony of inciting to sedition, upon the claim that it was
"borrowed" from the U.S.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sedition Act of 1798 which in turn has been struck down as inconsistent
with the First Amendment of the American Constitution,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<blockquote>"In the first place, ** our law on inciting to sedition is not
akin to the US Sedition Act of 1798 which was imposed on the American colonies
by their British ruler.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the success
of the American revolution, the 1798 Sedition Act naturally ceased to have
effect as it would be utterly incongrous to punish those who sought the
overthrow of the British government in America.</blockquote>

<blockquote>" * * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>" * * *.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To annul our law on sedition is to give license to those who
seek the application of lawless methods in the advancement of their political
views.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our constitution surely does not
contemplate this."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the petitioners postulate that in the determination of
the existence of probable cause from the constitutional aspect, it is required
that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"(1) The judge (or) officer
must examine the ** witnesses personally; (2) The examination must be under
oath; and (3) The examination must be reduced to writing in the form of
searching questions and answers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Marinas v. Siochio, 104 SCRA 403)."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of these principles they contend:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>firstly, that the mayor's questioning of the
witnesses was not "searching" enough; and secondly, that the
witnesses' testimony does not establish <i>prima facie</i> the commission of
the felony of inciting to sedition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact is that as shown by the record, questions about the
material events were in truth propounded by Mayor Lumayno to the chief witness,
Capt. Sanson;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn61" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>
and no proof to the contrary has been submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance that the answers given by
Capt. Sanson to the mayor's questions are closely reflective of the contents of
his affidavit should not come as a surprise and cannot, without more, be taken
as debilitating or nullifying the interrogation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's second point is much more substantial and is
decisive of the controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners are correct in their claim that Capt. Sanson's testimony<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn62" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a>
does not in truth contain any facts demonstrating the actuality of the crime of
inciting to sedition, which is the crime for which arrest warrants were issued
by Mayor Lumayno.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts recited by
Capt. Sanson may perhaps warrant a charge of traffic obstruction, or grave
coercion, or malicious mischief, or illegal possession of firearms or deadly
weapons, or maybe, attempted murder or homicide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it is barren of facts to support an
accusation of inciting to sedition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other evidence on record exhibits the same barrenness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two witnesses, Godofredo Hoyo-A and Elpidio Carbajosa, advert in
their affidavits<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn63" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

to the shouting of "seditious words," etc. Hoyo-A is quoted as
deposing that <i>"the demonstrators were already unruly ** (and kept) on shouting
anti-government slogans, ** invectives and seditious words against the
government"</i>;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn64" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></span></span></a>

ang dictatorial na regimen ni Pres Marcos, pamatukan ang NSL, ibagsak ang
military kagwalaon ang CHDF, suklan nato ang gobyerno</u>"</i>, a woman
speaker had said the same thing, and a third speaker, petitioner Daniel

Carbajosa in his turn declared that the demonstrators **<i> were shouting for
trouble and ready to make revolution with the use of arms."</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn68" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

is totally innocuous as far as proving the elements of inciting to sedition is
concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence can not justify the action taken by the respondent
Mayor and Judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court thus declares
as sorely inadequate and mortally defective the avowed evidentiary foundation
for Mayor Lumayno's finding of probable cause respecting the commission by the
petitioners of the crime of inciting to sedition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The affiants' declarations in their sworn
statements which might otherwise be pertinent to the offense, are generalities,
mere conclusions of theirs, not positive averments of particular facts within
their personal knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They do not
identify the specific persons supposed to have perpetrated the crime charged,
except two.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But even the identification
of these two is of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For except
as regards Capt. Sanson, whose testimony, to repeat, is in any case ineffectual
to prove the precise offense ascribed to the petitioners, there had been <b>no
searching</b> <b>interrogation</b> by Mayor Lumayno of the witnesses as
required by the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
whatever credit could possibly have been accorded to the affidavit of Hoyo-A --
which ventures to quote the exact words allegedly shouted by petitioners Arnaiz
and Gempesela, and an unidentified woman -- was thereby effectively foreclosed.</p>
