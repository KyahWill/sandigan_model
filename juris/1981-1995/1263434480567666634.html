				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">There were two witnesses who allegedly saw the killing, not to mention
the victim herself, who identified her assailant shortly before she died.  Yet the Solicitor General, who is usually
for sustaining the conviction by the trial court, is unconvinced and has asked
for its reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pacifico Dunig was formally charged with the murder of Marilyn
Canatoy, then 14 years old, in an information filed with the Regional Trial
Court of Bulacan.  The allegation was
that on April 5, 1990, in San Ildefonso, Bulacan, he repeatedly stabbed and
thus killed the said girl, the attack being accompanied with treachery, evident
premeditation and abuse of superior strength.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">  To prove its case, the
prosecution presented three witnesses, besides the doctor who testified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>the cause of the victim's
death.  These were Maylin Montes, her
sister, Katherine Montes, and their mother, Teresita Montes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Maylin Montes, who was ten years old at the time of the trial,
said that at about 7 o'clock in the evening of April 4, 1990, she, Katherine, a
certain Flory, and her Ate Marilyn went to sleep at the resthouse belonging to
one Atty. Andrade.  Marilyn slept in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>bamboo bed, and the rest of them
slept under the bed.  Maylin said that
at about 3 o'clock in the morning, she saw Dunig stab Marilyn in the neck three
times.  The three girls ran to Andrade's
house about 8 meters away where her father and mother were staying.  Marilyn did, too, and collapsed at the door.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">Katherine Montes, thirteen years old at that time, corroborated
her sister's testimony.  She said she
also saw <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Dunig </span>running away
after she heard her Ate Marilyn screaming.  She said she ran to the house ahead of Marilyn and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">she </span>heard the stricken girl say,
"Nanay, nanay, sinaksak ako ni Pico."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
"Pico" is Dunig's nickname.</p>

<p class="BODY">Teresita Montes, the girls' mother, declared on the stand that at
about 9 o'clock in the morning of April 4, 1990, she saw Pico and her niece
Marilyn quarreling.  At about 3 o'clock
the following morning, she was awakened when Marilyn knocked at her door.  Marilyn's neck was bleeding, and she cried
to her: "Nanay, nanay, bigyan ninyo ako ng katarungan dahil sinaksak ako
ni Pico." A minute later, she died.  Behind Marilyn were Maylin, Katherine and Flory.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Nicanor Cruz informed the court that Marilyn died of
hemorrhage due to multiple stab and incised wounds in the neck.  He opined uncertainly that the victim might
or might not have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">able </span>to
speak or run to the house after the stabbing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dunig's defense was alibi.  He said that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>the night
in question, he was alone in a nipa hut in Matinbubong, San Ildefonso, Bulacan,
where he went to sleep at 9 p.m. and awoke the following morning at 6
o'clock.  He swore he was not in the
resthouse where, and at the time, Marilyn was killed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Amado M. Calderon, disbelieving him, found him guilty as
charged.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court, after considering the evidence, holds that the conviction cannot
stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alibi is unquestionably <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a
</span>weak defense, and it is clearly so in the case at bar.  Dunig has not presented <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>single witness to corroborate
him.  There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">is </span>also the admitted fact that the nipa hut where he supposedly
slept was only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>kilometer away
from the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, we have repeatedly stressed that a person's conviction
must rest not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>the weakness of
his defense but on the strength of the prosecution.  The accused can rely on the constitutional presumption of his
innocence.  It is for the prosecution to
overcome that presumption with convincing proof that the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>guilty; otherwise, he must be
absolved.  In the case at bar, we find
that the prosecution has not proved its case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the two alleged eyewitnesses to the killing
are not believable.  While insisting
that she saw Dunig stab Marilyn, Maylin also admitted that it was pitch dark
when they awoke and there was not a single light in the resthouse or nearby.  (Or from the moon either, for that
matter.)  Katherine said she only saw
"what looked like a shadow" and concluded it was Dunig.  Assuming the sisters did wake up when
Marilyn screamed, it would have taken some time before their eyes could get
accustomed to the darkness.  Yet both
said they immediately recognized the accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">If there was anything certain about their testimonies, it was
their certainty that the resthouse was dark when they allegedly saw Dunig
stabbing their cousin.</p>

<p class="BODY">Maylin agreed it was "so dark."</p>

<p class="BODY">So much for the sisters <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for
</span>the nonco.  Now for their mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is some confusion as to who arrived first in the house,
Katherine saying it was she, Maylin and Flory who did while Teresita Montes,
her mother, said it was Marilyn.  But
that is not really important.  What is
is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Teresita's testimony that Marilyn
said to her a minute before the girl died: "Nanay, nanay, bigyan ninyo ako
ng katarungan dahil sinaksak ako ni </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">Pico."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">If<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it is true that the victim did make that statement before she
died, it should qualify as a dying declaration and so can be considered an
exception to the hearsay rule.  Nonetheless, it cannot be automatically accepted as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a t</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ruthful accusation and is still subject to the test of credibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A dying declaration is
entitled to the highest credence on the theory that a person </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">who </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">knows he is on the verge of death is not likely to make </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">false accusation.  However, the
declaration, albeit presumably in good faith, may still be based on an erroneous
identification of the declarant's killer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar, it
has been established by the testimonies of the Montes sisters that the
resthouse was dark, if not, indeed, completely dark.  Like the other three girls who were sleeping there with her,
Marilyn could not possibly have seen the person who was attacking her.  At best, she could probably only surmise it
was Dunig, but that was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">most uncertain identification.  A surmise is not evidence.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">A
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">man's honor and liberty cannot
be forfeited because the victim supposedly pointed to him as her killer
although she could not possibly have seen the person who was stabbing her </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the dark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At that, we cannot even
be certain that the dying Marilyn really made that declaration against
Dunig.  By corroborating their mother's
testimony, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Maylin </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>Katherine may have instead
enfeebled it because their own credibility regarding what they said they saw in
the dark resthouse is also suspect.  It
must also be noted that the doctor who autopsied the victim's body was not sure
if Marilyn would have been able to speak at all after she was stabbed because
of the severity and location of her wounds.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Significantly, the statement she supposedly made to Teresita was strenuously
long for a person who died a minute later.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>mother
and her daughters have put two and two together and come <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">out </span>with a sum of five.  Teresita makes much of the quarrels of
Marilyn and Pico to bolster her belief that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Dunig </span>is the girl's killer.  Such quarrels, if true, may be evidence of motive but not necessarily of
murder.  In fact, Katherine said that
the day before Marilyn was killed, Dunig was in the resthouse <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and apparently in good spirits, </span>as he
was strumming his guitar and singing.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that Katherine, seeing what looked like a shadow
("parang shadow") pass by her in the dark that morning, immediately
concluded it was Dunig who had stabbed Marilyn.  As for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Maylin, she was </span>sure
Dunig was the killer for the preposterous reason that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">he was </span>in the resthouse in the afternoon of April 4, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus -</p>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
stated, Maylin, that it was Pacifico  Dunig who stabbed Marilyn.  And
you also said that there was no light whatsoever that time.  How did you know that it was Pacifico Dunig

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution is a slender reed.  It cannot sustain a conviction.  The defense is weak, but the prosecution is
even weaker, based as it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>mainly
on the narration of the alleged eyewitnesses who claimed to have seen the
killing, one in total darkness and another in near total darkness that enabled
her to see a shadow that passed by her.  The tales are implausible.  We
cannot accept <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">them.  </span>The Court has no choice but to
exonerate the accused-appellant because his guilt has not been proved beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>
