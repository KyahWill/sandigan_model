Republic Act No. 6425 (The Dangerous Drugs Act), as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accusatory portion of the Information in Criminal Case No.
5701 reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 13th day of June, 1987, in the City of
Bacolod, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the

Bacolod, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
herein accused, without being authorized by law, did, then and there,
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession and control two

<p class="BODY">Both informations were filed on 16 June 1987 with the Regional
Trial Court (RTC) of Negros Occidental.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two (2) cases were consolidated and assigned to Branch 45 of
the said RTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon his arraignment on 18 December 1987, the accused, assisted
by his counsel <i>de oficio</i>, Atty. Ramon Ditching, Jr., entered a plea of
not guilty in both cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, the prosecution presented two (2) members of the
buy-bust team namely, Sgt. Virgilio Caro and C1C Domingo S. Bolivar, who
testified as to how the buy-bust operation was conducted; it also presented
P/Lt. Zenaida Sinfuego, the forensic chemist who examined the articles
allegedly taken from the accused and found the same positive for
marijuana.  On the other hand, the
accused relied merely on his own testimony for his defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 September 1989, the trial court promulgated its decision<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

of the decision in the first case reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, this Court finds that the
prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in
Crim. Case No. 5701, without attendant circumstances, and therefore sentences
him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay the fine of
P20,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, with all the
accessory penalties provided by law, and to pay the costs."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the second case, the dispositive
portion, found pages away, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, for lack of evidence
to prove the charge of Violation of Sec. 8 of R.A. 6425, as amended, the
accused Freddie Tantiado y Billones is ACQUITTED, with costs de oficio."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision in Criminal Case No. 5701, the
accused appealed therefrom to this Court by filing a notice of appeal with the
RTC on 13 October 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its Order of 17 November 1987,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> the
trial court gave due course to the appeal but erroneously ordered the
transmittal of the records of the case to the Court of Appeals, which the Clerk
of Court complied with to the letter.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> The

The Docket Section of this Court, probably misled by the transmittal of the
records of the two (2) criminal cases, docketed the appeal as G.R. Nos.
92795-96.  Since what is being appealed
by the accused is the decision in Criminal Case No. 5701, only one (1) docket number
should have been assigned to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence, based on the testimonies of Sgt.
Virgilio Caro and C1C Domingo S. Bolivar of the Philippine Constabulary
Narcotics Command (PC NARCOM), Bacolod City, and Lt. Zenaida Sinfuego, forensic
chemist of the PC/INP Crime Laboratory, Iloilo City, establishes the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Having received information about two (2) or three (3) days prior
to 13 June 1987 that a certain drug pusher was engaged in the selling of
marijuana at Saturn St., Singcang, Bacolod City, PC NARCOM agents conducted a
surveillance in the area; the said information was subsequently confirmed.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In the morning of 13 June 1987, at around 10:00 a.m., the PC NARCOM sent a team
composed of 1Lt. Gualberto Medalla, Sgt. Virgilio Caro and C1C Domingo S.
Bolivar to conduct a buy-bust operation in the area together with one Nestor
Agudo, an alleged member of the Philippine Army, who was to act as
poseur-buyer.  The latter was instructed
to pretend to be a drug user who wanted to buy marijuana sticks from the
suspected pusher; he was told that upon receiving the said marijuana, he was
supposed to tap his head.  This would be
the signal for the agents to move in against the suspected pusher.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The team thus proceeded to the house of the accused at Saturn
St., Singcang, Bacolod City; the PC NARCOM agents posted themselves outside the
house while the poseur-buyer went in to purchase P9.00 worth of marijuana.  After a while, the poseur-buyer went out of
the house and gave the pre-arranged signal -- the tapping of his head -- to the
members of the buy-bust team.  Upon
seeing the signal, the team swooped down into the house, introduced themselves
as police authorities and placed the accused under arrest for selling marijuana.  They then searched the body of the accused
and allegedly recovered the ten-peso bill used in the purchase.  They likewise searched his house and found
two (2) match boxes full of marijuana leaves and seeds.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, when questioned as to who his source of marijuana
was, the accused named a certain Jimmy Blanca of Capitol Extension, Bacolod
City.  The NARCOM agents, together with
the accused, then proceeded to Jimmy's house in Capitol Extension;
unfortunately, they were not able to locate him there.  They were informed that Jimmy Blanca had
gone to Punta Taytay.  Thus, they
proceeded to Punta Taytay where they were able to arrest him; when accosted,
Jimmy had in his possession 20 grams of marijuana.  Both the accused and Jimmy Blanca were then brought to the police
station for investigation; while there, the accused, without the assistance of
counsel,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
executed an affidavit wherein he admitted his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The seized items were later brought to the PC/INP Crime
Laboratory in Iloilo City where they were examined by Lt. Zenaida Sinfuego.  After examining the three (3) marijuana
cigarettes and the two (2) match boxes containing suspected marijuana seeds,
she found them positive for marijuana.  Her findings are contained in Chemistry Report No. D-126-87.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused's version of the incident is summarized by the trial
court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The defense presented only one witness, the accused Freddie
Tantiado, 23 years old, single and a resident of 142-C Saturn-Venus Sts.,
Singcang, Bacolod City.  He testified
that on June 13, 1987, alone (sic), in his house made of wood at Singcang,
Bacolod City, C1C Domingo S. Bolivar rammed the door and when he gained
entrance he fired a shot while Lt. Medalla and Sgt. Caro conducted a search,
without search warrant neither (sic) did they introduce themselves.  At around 10:00 o'clock accused Freddie
Tantiado was brought to the headquarters and while in transit riding on (sic) a
jeep the NARCOM Agents kept on asking him the source of the marijuana and he
pointed to Jimmy Blanca, a resident of Capitol Extension, Bacolod City.  But when they arrived there Jimmy Blanca was
at Punta Taytay.  So they proceeded to
Punta Taytay where Jimmy Blanca was apprehended.  He and Jimmy Blanca were brought to the PC Headquarters.  C1C Bolivar and Sgt. Caro investigated him
while Jimmy Blanca was investigated by Lt. Medalla.  He was apprised of his constitutional right to be assisted by
counsel but he told them that he did not know of any lawyer.  Despite the fact that he had no counsel they
continued on asking him in vernacular (sic) while the same was translated to
English.  After the investigation (he)
Freddie Tantiado was told to sign the affidavit, Exh. "A", signed by
Freddie Tantiado, Exh. "A-1".  Later he was taken to the City Jail."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, accused assigns the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>“I.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING (sic)
THE NON-PRESENTATION OF THE ALLEGED POSEUR-BUYER AS WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION
A FATAL FLAW.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II.   THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL FAITH
AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.</blockquote>

<blockquote>III.    THE
TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT FREDDIE TANTIADO
Y BILLONES ON THE GROUND THAT HIS GUILT WAS NOT PROVED BEYOND REASONABLE
DOUBT."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assigned error, accused contends that the
testimony of Nestor Agudo, the poseur-buyer, was necessary to the prosecution's
cause because not one of the members of the buy-bust team saw what had actually
transpired between him (accused) and the said poseur-buyer.  The testimonies of Sgt. Caro and C1C Bolivar
which pointed to the accused as having sold three (3) sticks of marijuana
cigarettes to the poseur-buyer do not inspire belief for the two are not in a
position to narrate what had happened in the morning of 13 June 1987.  Thus, accused stresses that the poseur-buyer
should have been presented as a witness to shed light on the alleged criminal
transaction; he further claims that the non-presentation of said poseur-buyer
gives rise to the presumption that had the latter testified, his testimony
would be insufficient to support a finding of guilt.  Accused also points out to the fact that the ten-peso bill (with
serial number SYO 45433) allegedly used in the buy-bust operation was not
presented in evidence; such a circumstance casts additional doubt on the
veracity of the prosecution's version of the transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, he contends that the statement taken from him during
the custodial investigation is inadmissible in evidence because it was given
without the assistance of counsel; thus, paragraphs (1) and (3), Section 12,
Article III of the New Constitution were violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his second assignment of error, accused bewails the fact that
the trial court believed the prosecution witnesses because his own testimony
had lapses and inconsistencies.  He
asserts that as a matter of fact, the prosecution witnesses, C1C Bolivar and
Sgt. Caro, gave conflicting and contradictory statements themselves:<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Confronted during trial, C1C (sic) Bolivar stated that
accused-appellant was with two other persons when they arrested him inside his
house and that the poseur-buyer was able to buy marijuana from the accused?appellant
worth P9.00, only to state later on that a P10.00 bill was recovered.  (TSN, November 25, 1988 pp. 7 &amp; 30)  However, Sgt. Caro (who claimed being (sic)
present during the buy-bust operation) testified otherwise to the effect that
accused-appellant was alone inside his house when they put him under arrest for
selling marijuana worth P9.00 (TSN, May 11, 1988 pp. 5 &amp; 12).  On that score, their credibility as a
witness (sic) is no doubt tainted, hence, undeserving even the (sic) scantiest
(sic) attention."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Concluding with his last assignment of error, accused submits
that his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt; hence, the Constitutional
presumption of innocence should prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused should be acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Appellee's Brief, the Solicitor General:  candidly concedes to the accused's position
that the latter's guilt for the crime of unlawful sale of marijuana under Section
4, Article II of the Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended, was not sufficiently
proven; agrees with the argument that the presentation of Nestor Agudo, the
poseur-buyer, was necessary to establish that he (accused) sold marijuana to
the said poseur?buyer; declares that the testimonies of Sgt. Caro and C1C
Bolivar are merely hearsay because these two (2) did not see the actual sale
itself; and acquiesces to the conclusion that the failure of the prosecution to
present the poseur-buyer gives rise to the presumption that evidence willfully
suppressed would be adverse if produced.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General further agrees with the accused's assertion
that the testimony of Sgt. Caro -- to the effect that the accused was alone
when arrested -- irreconcilably conflicts with the statement of C1C Bolivar,
Jr. that the accused, when apprehended, was with two (2) companions and that
they were smoking marijuana.  This
unexplained and irreconcilable conflict casts more doubt on the alleged
buy-bust operation and renders the testimony of the poseur-buyer indispensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, while the Solicitor General is convinced that the
accused cannot be held liable for the violation of Section 4, Article II of the
Dangerous Drugs Act, as amended, a conviction for the unlawful possession of
prohibited drugs will, nevertheless, lie under Section 8, Article II of the
said Act in view of an admission in open court that at the time he was
arrested, the accused was in possession of marijuana obtained from Jimmy
Blanca.  The crime of unlawful possession
penalized in Section 8 is necessarily included in the crime of unlawful sale
penalized in Section 4.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful review of the evidence adduced by the Prosecution
sustains the conclusion of both the accused and the Solicitor General that with
respect to the alleged violation of Section 4, Article II of the Dangerous
Drugs Act, the prosecution failed to discharge its burden of proving beyond
reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused.  And as will be shown later, neither can the latter be convicted for the
lesser crime of unlawful possession defined under Section 8 of said Article.
The accused, therefore, is entitled to an acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Prosecution's fatal mistake lies in its failure to call to
the witness stand the poseur-buyer.  We
are thus confronted with a situation where the success of the prosecution
depends entirely upon the testimony of the poseur-buyer because (a) the PC
NARCOM agents who planned and implemented the buy-bust operation did not
actually witness the alleged transaction between the poseur-buyer and the
accused which purportedly took place inside the latter's house and beyond the
view of the agents; (b) there is absolutely no evidence to show when and how
the poseur-buyer allegedly delivered or turned over to the NARCOM agents the three
(3) marijuana sticks allegedly bought from the accused for P9.00; and (c) the
so-called buy-bust money was not pre-marked, identified by any witness and
offered in evidence; the same is only mentioned in the receipt of property
seized (Exh. "C").</p>

<p class="BODY">That the NARCOM agents were not able to observe the poseur­-buyer
and the accused when the purported transaction took place is admitted by agent
Bolivar, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL CUÑADA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>  x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
I understand from your answer that when the agent [meaning, poseur-buyer] made
the purchase he was visible to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
sir.  It was inside the house but we
were posted near the house where the suspect was staying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
seeing the pre-arranged signal, what did you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
immediately came to the house where the suspect was staying."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Both Caro and Bolivar failed to reveal in
their respective testimonies how they were able to obtain possession of the
three (3) sticks of marijuana cigarettes.  This is, in all probability, due to the fact that the prosecuting
fiscal, either by sheer negligence or inadvertence, failed to ask the said
witnesses questions relating thereto.  While it appears that the poseur-buyer, for security reasons,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
left the scene of the buy-bust operation immediately after the arrest,
information as to what he did after giving the pre-arranged signal but before
leaving was not elicited from him.  This
gap in the prosecution's evidence has thus added more doubt to an already
inconclusive finding with respect to the cause of the accused's arrest.  While during direct examination, Caro
testified that the accused was arrested for selling <u>three</u> (<u>3</u>) <u>sticks</u>
<u>of</u> <u>marijuana</u> <u>cigarettes</u>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
did you arrest him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(Witness)
We arrested Freddie Tantiado because he was selling 3 sticks of marijuana to
our pusher (sic) buyer."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On cross-examination, he declared that
the accused was arrested for selling <u>marijuana</u> <u>leaves</u>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. DITCHING, JR.:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
was the reason why you arrested the suspect?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
was actually selling marijuana leaves."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Compounding the weakness of the prosecution's evidence on this
point is Bolivar's candid admission during cross-examination that based on the
information given by the poseur-buyer, he merely presumed or concluded that the
three (3) marijuana sticks and the 50 grams of marijuana leaves in two (2)
match boxes belonged to the accused.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. DITCHING:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  And you also stated before that you presumed that the three sticks of
marijuana and the 50 grams of marijuana leaves in two match boxes belonged to
the accused, is that right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A    Because of the information given
to us by our agent that he bought the sticks of marijuana from the accused so
we can conclude (sic) that those (sic) marijuana belonged to him."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the NARCOM agents’ failure to witness the alleged
transaction between their poseur-buyer and the accused, which thus renders
their testimonies in respect thereto as hearsay, and the inability of the
prosecution to establish when and how the agents obtained possession of the
three (3) sticks of marijuana cigarettes from the poseur-buyer, the testimony
of the poseur-buyer becomes significantly material and indispensable;
therefore, the same should not be considered as merely cumulative or
corroborative evidence.  Without such
testimony, it is inconceivable that the prosecution would be able to discharge
its burden of rebutting the presumption of innocence which every accused enjoys
under the Bill of Rights in our Constitution.  Otherwise stated, the alleged sale of the three (3) sticks of marijuana
cannot be established without the testimony of the poseur-buyer.  Thus, the instant case presents a situation
which is to be viewed as an exception to the general rule that the
non-presentation of the poseur-buyer is not essential for the conviction of the
accused if the testimony of the former is merely cumulative or corroborative.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>People vs. Olaes,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"Secondly, this case exemplifies the instance where the
non-presentation of the supposed poseur-buyer is fatal to the prosecution's case.  The records show that the alleged sales
transaction took place inside the house of appellant.  In other words, the transaction was supposedly witnessed only by
the poseur-buyer, Manuelito Bernardo.  Only he has personal knowledge of such transaction which is the subject
matter of this prosecution.  In<i>
People vs. Ramos</i>, (186 SCRA 184, [1990]) where the alleged informant and
poseur-buyer was one and the same person, we stressed that without the
testimony of said poseur-buyer, there is no convincing evidence pointing to the
accused having sold marijuana.  In this
case, the police officers did not see the actual sale of marijuana.  For the culprit to be convicted, the element
of sale must be unequivocally established.  Yet, the alleged poseur-buyer in the ‘buy-bust’ operation, the only one
who allegedly dealt directly with appellant in the purchase of marijuana, was
not presented at all at the trial.  Under such circumstances, we have repeatedly held that the failure of
the prosecution to present the alleged buyer was a fatal blow to the case
against the accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is also merit in the accused's contention that the buy-bust
money should have been presented in evidence.  In the absence of an eyewitness to the sale of the three (3) sticks of
marijuana cigarettes, the identification and submission in evidence of the
buy-bust money was necessary, if not indispensable, to prove, even if only
circumstantially, the fact of sale.  In
previous cases, this Court ruled that the prosecution need not present in
evidence the buy-bust money if the sale of the prohibited drug had been
adequately proven by other independent evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no need to discuss the accused's final plea under the
first assigned of error that his affidavit, made without the assistance of counsel
during custodial interrogation, is inadmissible in evidence as the trial court,
correctly rejected the same.  Indeed, it
was taken in violation of his right to be informed of his right to remain
silent and his right to have competent and independent counsel which are both
guaranteed under Section 12(1), Article III of the 1987 Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, however, maintains that although the
accused cannot be convicted for the unlawful sale of the sticks of marijuana
cigarettes under Section 4, Article II of the Dangerous Drugs Act, he can be
held liable for and be convicted of the unlawful possession thereof under
Section 8 of said Article because he admitted such possession during
cross-examination.  We are unable to
agree with the Solicitor General.  The
contention presupposes the existence of sufficient evidence on record to show
that the three (3) sticks of marijuana cigarettes came from the accused.  As had been earlier discussed, NARCOM agents
Caro and Bolivar did not witness the transaction between the poseur-buyer and
the accused; hence, they could not have seen the delivery of the marijuana to
the poseur-buyer.  Furthermore, both
agents did not state that the poseur-buyer turned the three (3) sticks of
marijuana cigarettes over to them; as a matter of fact, there was palpable
confusion on their part as to whether they arrested the accused for possession
of the cigarette sticks or of marijuana leaves.</p>

<p class="BODY">The so-called admission by the accused on cross-examination is
found in the transcript and reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL GARCIA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
you said that after you were arrested and brought to the PU and (sic) you rode
in the PU and you passed by Capitol Extension to the (sic) house of Jimmy
Blanca, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know why you passed by the house of Jimmy Blanca at Capitol Extension?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
they asked me to pin-point from (sic) whom I got the marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, you were the one who told the NARCOM (sic) agents that you got the
marijuana from the house of Jimmy Blanca?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, it is clear now that you were not alone and you have (sic)
companions namely:  Celso Britaña and
Placido Jabian?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
it not a fact that you talked to your friends and you and your friends were
smoking some marijuana cigarettes?</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(witness)
Yes, Sir.”<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be concluded from the cited portion that the accused
admitted possession of the three (3) sticks of marijuana cigarettes.  All that he specifically admitted is that
(1) he procured marijuana and (2) <u>smoked</u> the same.  The cross-examiner failed to establish that
the three (3) sticks corresponded to the marijuana which he obtained.  Also, while his smoking thereof proves
possession and use, the same cannot remotely refer to the three (3) sticks as
these were not even proven to have been partially used by a smoker.  Moreover, if it could be shown that accused
was smoking a different stick, with more reason that he cannot be convicted
therefor because he was not charged for that.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, there may be enough basis for the NARCOM agents to suspect
that the accused is either a pusher or a user.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the inefficient, if not bungled, implementation of a
poorly prepared buy-bust plan, coupled with the failure of the prosecution to
present a vital witness who could have cured the fatal flaw in its evidence,
ensured the acquittal of the accused.  It may also be true that the evidence for the accused is weak.  Nonetheless, if the evidence for the
prosecution does not meet the quantum of proof required for a conviction, <i>i.e</i>.,
proof beyond reasonable doubt, the weakness of the accused's evidence is
totally irrelevant for, as a matter of fact, he is not even called upon to
offer the evidence in his behalf.  The
prosecution must rely on the strength of its evidence and not on the weakness
of the evidence for the defense<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> for
an accusation is not, in the light of the Constitutional presumption of
innocence, synonymous with guilt.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Because of its ineptitude, the Government has again lost a case
in the fight against drug pushers and users.  It is then timely to exhort the law enforcement agencies, especially
those assigned to enforce the Dangerous Drugs Act, to carefully prepare their
plans for buy-bust operations and to efficiently and effectively carry them
out, ever mindful of the possibility that their blunders may not only frustrate
the efforts to eradicate the drug menace but worse, embolden drug lords,
pushers or users into defying the authorities.  The drug problem has reached harrowing proportions.  It has broken the lives, shattered the hopes
and destroyed the future of thousands of our young citizens.  Society can hardly excuse such blunders in
the relentless war against the menace.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the prosecuting arm of the Government, We reiterate what this
Court had said in <i>People vs. Esquivel:</i><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>“In this connection it may not be out of place to bring to the
attention of prosecuting attorneys the absolute necessity of laying before the
court the pertinent facts at their disposal with methodical and meticulous
attention, clarifying contradictions and filling up gaps and loopholes in their
evidence, to the end that the court's mind may not be tortured by doubts, that
the innocent may not suffer and the guilty not escape unpunished.  Obvious to all, this is the prosecution's
prime duty to the court, to the accused, and to the state."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for failure of the prosecution to prove the
guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, the decision in Criminal Case No.
