<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution, as summarized by the trial court,
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Complainant, JOCELYN CADELIÑA, 16 years old, jobless, single
and a resident of sitio Amalao, barangay Tagpo, Bais City, testified that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>She knows the accused as the latter is the husband of Marietta
Indiao who is her mother's sister, by affinity, accused is her
uncle-in-law.  At about 2:00 o'clock in
the afternoon of August 31, 1991, she attended the services of the Youth
Services Organization in Bais City, and after the service, she helped in the
cleaning of their church, which ended at 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon.  Afterwards, they had choir practice, and
having finished practice, ate supper in the house of the pastor upon invitation
of the latter.  Later at 10:00 o'clock
in the evening, together with a co-member of the choir, Cherryl Palacios, they
proceeded home riding on a pedicab, their houses being near to each other.  Together with her sister and friends, they
were renting a house situated at Aglipay St., Bais City which was owned by one
Macrina Padero, mother of the <span style="">accused.  At that time, she stayed at the second floor
of the rented house as the school is far from their home at barangay
Tagpo.  Upon arrival at said rented
house at past 10:00 o'clock in the evening of August 31, 1991, and before she
went up to the second </span>floor, she noticed accused sleeping inside a
mosquito net at the ground floor.  She
was not surprised on seeing the accused sleeping at the ground floor that night
as she had been used to seeing the accused slept [sic] there.  She immediately went upstairs to the second
floor, and went to sleep alone that night as her sister, Darwinda, and her
friends, Melissa Adalid and one Marilou were not there.  At about 11:00 o'clock, that same night, she
woke up to find accused on top of her with his right arm holding a knife, and
his left hand holding her right arm.  Accused told her 'don't shout because if you shout I will kill you'.  (TSN, p. 12, March 18, 1992) For fear, she
did not shout.  After having removed her
blouse and panty with his left hand, accused successfully raped her.  She tried to resist but was pinned down by
the accused, who was aiming the knife at her.  After warning her not to report the incident otherwise he will kill her,
accused went back to sleep on the ground floor, but she was not able to sleep
the rest of the night.  With the threat
to kill her by the accused, she did not report the incident to anybody, until
after several months, she was forced to tell her mother as she was
conceiving.  Her mother, Damiana
Cadeliña, immediately filed a complaint.  She suffered sadness and mental anguish caused by the sexual abuse on
her by the accused, and leaves to the court damages that may be awarded to
her.”<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused, who was 21 years old at the time
he testified on 1 April 1992, admitted having sexual intercourse on several
occasions with the complainant, the niece of his wife, but alleged that these
were all with her consent.  His
testimony is condensed by the trial court in this wise:</p>

<p class="2Q">"His relationship with Jocelyn started sometime in March,
1991, at the house of her mother, where Jocelyn was renting.  It started when he noticed that she usually
sat on his lap, and paid special attention to him.  He reminded her that how could they maintain such relationship
considering that she is his niece, but Jocelyn countered that she was in love
with him and her aunt (accused's wife) was not around.  From the commencement of their relationship,
and whenever he was in Bais City, he usually slept in the house rented by
Jocelyn.  In furtherance of said illicit
relationship, they started kissing each other.  It was in the month of August, 1991 that they had their first sexual
intercourse.  On that day, Jocelyn who
arrived from the market at 9:00 o'clock in the evening, told him to bring his
mosquito net and folding bed to the house she was renting.  At that time, he was drinking beer with his
brother in front of his mother's store.  After having brought the mosquito net and the folding bed to the rented
house, he went back to continue drinking with his brother.  Later, past midnight, he went back to the
rented house, and saw complainant already lying on his folding bed.  He asked her what she was doing in his folding
bed, but she cautioned him to be silent, and she pulled him down, and thereupon
they have their first sexual intercourse.  After that, they had sexual intercourse for about fifteen (15) times in
that very house, usually at the time when the other occupants in the rented
house were not around.  They likewise
engaged in sexual activities short of intercourse in the house of Jocelyn, and
in his father-in-law's house in sitio Amalao.  <span style="">His </span>relationship with
Jocelyn ended in October, 1991, when he avoided her due to the latter's wish
that they go away but which wish he did not agree as he has a wife and
children.  During their intimate
moments, Jocelyn revealed to him that she had relationship with a certain
Pedring, Ali Labeste and a certain Amay.  Jocelyn was motivated into filing this case against him for his having
avoided her, and the condition imposed by her mother that they should see first
the appearance of the child to be given birth before they will give expenses
for delivery."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He sought to buttress his defense with the testimonies of Loreta
Samane, Elsa Garcia, Macrina Padero, and his wife, Marietta Padero.  Loreta Samane, the accused's maid, declared
that one early morning in March 1991 when she was in the house of Clara
Cadeliña, she was requested by Clara to get a plate and spoon from the house of
Damiana Cadeliña (mother of the complainant); that when the door of the
latter's house was opened for her by Wengweng, a 14-year old sister of the
complainant, Loreta saw the accused and the complainant covered by a blanket
underneath a table.  Suddenly a gust of
wind blew away the blanket and she saw the complainant fondling the sex organ
of the accused.  On another occasion,
also <span style="">in </span>March 1991 at about
noon, she saw the latter and the complainant lying down in the middle of the
house with the complainant's legs wrapped around those of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Elsa Garcia, who has been occupying the unit adjacent to that rented by the
complainant and one Marilou since 16 September 1991, declared that in the
evening of that date she heard noises from the unit occupied by the
complainant, so she peeped through a hole in the wall and saw the complainant,
who was not fully dressed, on top of the accused on a folding bed while
caressing him.  At another time, she
also saw the complainant approach the accused, who was sitting at the doorway
of Elsa's unit, and tell him that she was "two months pregnant."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Macrina Padero, the mother of the accused, testified that
sometime in October 1991, she met Damiana Cadeliña at the house of Elsa
Garcia.  Damiana told her that the
complainant and the accused "had a relationship" and that "in
case of delivery of the baby," she (Macrina) "is obligated to spend
on the delivery." Macrina stated that she was willing to spend for the
child on condition that she "should see first the appearance of the
child".  Elsa, the accused, and his
wife were present at the time.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Marietta Padero testified that she frequently quarreled with her
husband, the accused herein, because she "was jealous with their [sic]
relationship with the woman, Jocelyn, her niece." During the instances
when Jocelyn came to her house, she observed that when she turned her back,
Jocelyn and her husband talked to each other, but when she was near them they
would stop conversing.  At one time,
Jocelyn accompanied her husband in fetching water.  She was present during the meeting between her mother-in-law
(Macrina) and Damiana wherein the former told the latter, "Day, if Jocelyn
gave birth, we will just help in<b> </b>the expenses.<span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On rebuttal, Clara Cadeliña denied the testimony of Loreta Samane
that sometime in March 1991 she ordered her to get a plate and spoon from
Damiana's house which is only two meters from her house<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and the testimony of Macrina Padero that she had a conference with Macrina in
the house of Elsa Garcia and that she requested Macrina to support the child of
the complainant.  Clara further declared
it is not possible, as testified to by Loreta, that the complainant and the
accused were covered with a <span style="">blanket
under the table, and that the complainant was fondling the sex organ of the
accused.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused seasonably appealed from the judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

<blockquote><span style="">II</span>.  THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE EVIDENCE FOR THE
DEFENSE.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">III</span>.  THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED GUILTY BEYOND

<p class="BODY">The accused admits having carnal knowledge of the complainant not
only on the date alleged in the information but for fifteen (15) more times
thereafter but maintains that he and the complainant are lovers and that the
complainant voluntarily had sex with him.  His testimony pictured the complainant as a woman passionately in love
with him, who not only initiated the first sexual encounter but longed for and
welcomed the others.  Accused further
maintains that an analysis of the complainant's testimony discloses other signs
of the absence of force or intimidation:  she manifested no form of resistance; she made no outcry at the start of
the sexual assault nor did she plead with the accused; she shed not a single
drop of tear at her defloration;<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> and
after the sexual act, instead of crying or cursing the accused for his
dastardly act, she nonchalantly sat down with the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Finally, the accused points out that although the alleged rape took place on 31
August 1991, it was only about three months later, upon learning that she was
pregnant, that the complainant revealed the alleged rape to her mother; her
explanation for the delay -- that the accused threatened to kill her if she
reported the incident -- is unacceptable because the threat, if any, was not
continuing.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In rape cases, the following guidelines have been laid down by
this Court:  (1) an accusation for rape
can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the
person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic
nature of the crime where only two persons are usually involved, the testimony
of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3) the
evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot
be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the complainant's testimony should not be received with
precipitate credulity, especially when the conviction depends at any vital
point upon her uncorroborated testimony; it should not be accepted unless her
sincerity and candor are free from suspicion.  Such testimony must be impeccable and ring true throughout, or credible
and positive.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The credibility then of the complainant is under scrutiny
here.  The trial court gave her
testimony full faith and credit.  The
general rule is that when the issue of credibility of witnesses is involved,
appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court
considering that the latter is in a better position to decide the question,
having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner
of testifying during the trial, unless certain facts of value have been plainly
overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The core issue here is whether the accused had carnal knowledge
of the complainant through the use of force or intimidation,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
or whether the complainant willingly consented to the sexual intercourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">A painstaking review of the evidence discloses vital facts of
immense importance in the determination of this issue -- ­facts which would
necessarily affect the result of this case but which the trial court apparently
overlooked or glossed over.  This case
then falls under the exception to the general rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">For one, despite the positive testimony of the accused which
squarely traversed the complainant's version of force or intimidation by
stating that he and the complainant had an intimate relationship, with the
latter as the more aggressive partner, and that their first sexual encounter in
August of 1991 was followed by fifteen more encounters at the same place during
week-ends when the complainant was alone, all of which were new facts, the
complainant was never recalled to the witness stand to rebut these obviously
damaging revelations of the accused.  The prosecution was simply contented with the presentation of Clara
Cadeliña, Rev. Lemuel Felecio, and Damiana Cadeliña to rebut some less
important, if not minor or trivial, matters brought out <span style="">in </span>the testimonies of Loreta Samane and Macrina Padero.  Why the complainant herself was not made to
rebut the damaging evidence against her is beyond us.  After the second rebuttal witness, Rev. Felecio, had finished his
testimony, the prosecutor simply announced to the court that the last rebuttal
witness would be Damiana Cadeliña.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The function of rebuttal evidence is to explain, repel,
counteract, or disprove the evidence of the adversary.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Its office is "to meet the new facts put in by the opponent in his case in
reply" and is "necessary only because, on a plea in denial, new
subordinate evidential facts have been offered, or because, on an affirmative
plea, its substantive facts have been put forward, or because, on any issue
whatever, facts discrediting the proponent's witnesses have been offered."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
While the presentation of rebuttal evidence is discretionary with the
prosecution in a criminal action,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> in the
instant case, the overwhelming import of the new facts disclosed by the accused
which have a damaging effect on the complainant's version made it imperative
for the prosecution to present rebuttal evidence.  Relegating the complainant to the background and presenting other
witnesses to rebut minor or trivial matters brought out in the evidence in
chief for the defense engender serious doubts on the <span style="">integrity </span>of her story.</p>

<p class="BODY">For another, we find enough evidence of the intimate relationship
between the complainant and the accused.  On cross-examination, she admitted that the accused used to sleep in the
unit of the house which she rented from his mother.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  You will agree with me that it was not the
only occasion [referring to 31 August 1991 when she was allegedly raped] that
Henry Padero slept on that unit of the house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
there were several occasions in the past that he slept on that unit?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
in those times Henry Padero occupied the ground floor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">She further revealed that the door to her
room at the upper story of the unit has no lock:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
According to you, you were occupying the upper storey, that room you were
occupying has a door is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
but there's no lock.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
that was the place which according to you that Henry raped you [sic]?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes
"<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And, as further testified to by her on
cross-examination, she declared that the accused usually came to her rented
unit every weekend since June 1991 and slept there despite the fact that the
house of his mother is only nearby:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
many times did Henry sleep in that house before this alleged incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
usually went there every weekend in my rented house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
his parents' house is very near to the house where you were renting?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
what month was that Henry started sleeping in your house where you were
occupying?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>June
1991."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Why the accused chose weekends can easily be explained by the
fact that the complainant's companions in the rented unit, including her own
sister, usually went home on Fridays.  He testified thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  In those times that you have these <span style="">activities together</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in the morning, where were the other
occupants in that dwelling occupied by Jocelyn?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
usually go home during Fridays."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If indeed there was no liaison between the complainant and the
accused, we find it rather unusual that the accused would spend his weekends in
her rented unit and not at his parents' residence which was just nearby, and
that instead of going home to her parent's home in Amalao, Tagpo, Bais City,
just as her companions were wont to, the complainant preferred to welcome the
accused in her rented unit and allow him to spend his weekend nights alone with
her.  She offered no satisfactory
explanation therefor.  These facts do
not appear to us to be innocuous coincidences.  Rather, they eloquently manifest a mutual understanding or a
predetermined plan.  She could not just
have accommodated an uncle-in-law even if he were in need of a place to sleep
after a hard day's work and reposed in him complete trust and confidence during
the tempting hours of the night without any lock on the door of her room to
keep her safe just <span style="">in case </span>he
was overpowered by the beast in him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, her conduct during and after coitus <span style="">unmistakably </span>discloses absence of even token resistance and
betrays her consent to the sexual congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">In one salient portion of the cross-examination, we find her
totally submissive in the face of the assault against her most prized
possession and unusually observant of the preparatory acts of the accused and
his eventual physiological and emotional transformation in fulfilled
libido.  Thus:</p>

<span style="">coitus.  As admitted by the complainant during the cross-examination, she

anything more about the knife.</p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore have serious doubts on the guilt of the accused for
the crime charged.  Although rape is
universally condemned as a most detestable crime, conviction therefor can, in
light of the presumption of innocence which is solemnly guaranteed by the Bill
of Rights, only lie upon proof beyond reasonable doubt or that degree of proof
which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.  Short of this, it is not only the right of the accused to be freed,
it is the constitutional duty of the court to acquit <span style="">him.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>This is not, of course, to say that
we approve of the conduct of the accused.  Indisputably, he took undue advantage of the complainant's feelings for
him and breached his vow of fidelity to his wife who happens to be the
complainant's aunt.  He should have
acted as a father or adviser to the complainant who is his own niece-in-law and
helped her develop in manners and virtue instead of corrupting her.</p>
