Marta Francisco-Reyes, sister of Petra.  Though he was not legally adopted, the boy was given the name Fernando
Periquet, Jr. and was reared to manhood by the spouses Periquet.  He is the petitioner in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 20, 1966, Fernando Periquet died.  He left a will dated March 28, 1940 wherein
he named his wife Petra as his universal heir.  Accordingly, Petra instituted Special Proceedings No. Q-10004 entitled

Hereditary Rights he executed in favor of Fernando Periquet, Jr. and to recover
his one-fourth (1/4) share in the estate of the late Petra Francisco Vda. de
Periquet.  The action for annulment was
based on "gross misrepresentation and fraud," "grave abuse of
confidence,” "mistake and undue influence," and "lack of cause
and/or consideration" in the execution of the challenged deed of
assignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on December 28,1980, private respondent Felix R.
Francisco passed away, hence, in a resolution dated September 23, 1985, the
court allowed his heirs to <span style="">be </span>substituted
in his stead.  In the same resolution,
we likewise recognized Manuel Macias, the first counsel of Felix Francisco, as
an intervenor in the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Fernando Periquet, Jr. contends that the execution of
the assignment of hereditary rights in his favor by Felix R. Francisco was not
tainted with fraud, deception, gross misrepresentation, or undue influence
because the latter read the instrument, understood its import and later signed
the same freely and voluntarily.  There
was likewise true and valid consideration in the execution of the instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, Felix R. Francisco alleges that petitioner committed
a number of unmistakable acts of fraud.  He claims that he was rushed into signing the instrument he never read
nor was explained to him.  He further
contends that petitioner abused the confidence he reposed on him when the
latter failed to make good his promise to give him P10,000.00 as consideration
for the execution of the deed of assignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The kind of fraud that will vitiate a contract refers to those
insidious words or machinations resorted to by one of the contracting parties
to induce the other to enter into a contract which without them he would not
have agreed to.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, no such fraud was employed by herein
petitioner.  Resultantly, the assignment
of hereditary rights executed by Felix Francisco in favor of herein petitioner
is valid and effective.</p>

<p class="BODY">Felix Francisco could not be considered to have been deceived
into signing the subject deed of assignment for the following reasons, <i style="">viz</i><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">First</span></b><span style="">, </span>the assignment was executed and signed freely and voluntarily by
Felix Francisco in order to honor, respect and give full effect to the last
wishes of his deceased sister, Petra.  The same was read by him and was further explained by Atty. Diosdado
Guytingco.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, witnesses for petitioner, Antonio Eugenio and Elias Fermin, who
also served as witnesses in the execution and signing of the deed of assignment
testified to the foregoing.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> They
declared that Felix Francisco was neither forced nor intimidated to sign the
assignment of hereditary rights.  He did
so out of his own free will and volition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">Second</span></b><span style="">, </span>there was valid cause or consideration in the execution of the
assignment of hereditary rights.  Contrary
to the trial court's finding that the amount of P10,000.00 as promised by Dr.
Fernando Periquet, Jr. to Felix Francisco is the cause or consideration of the
assignment, we find and so rule that it was the generosity or liberality of
Felix Francisco that impelled him to execute the questioned instrument.  Pure beneficence, not monetary
consideration, was the moving force because Felix wanted to respect the wishes
of a deceased sibling.  Consequently,
the award of P10,000.00 to private respondent Felix Francisco as consideration
of the assignment of hereditary rights is eliminated, the deed thus executed
being merely gratuitous in nature.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">Third</b><span style="">, </span>the allegation of fraud is an
afterthought on the part of the assignor, Felix Francisco who filed the instant
case to annul the deed of assignment on the ground of fraud only in 1970,
almost four (4) years after he executed the instrument.  He initiated the proceedings immediately
upon learning from his niece, Gloria Zaragoza that a compromise agreement was
reached by the parties in Special Proceedings Nos. Q-10004 and Q-11074 and that
they were to receive certain amounts from the settlement.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, Felix even admitted in his testimony that he was waiting for the
outcome of the cases before filing his own independent action.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, Felix slept on his rights and allowed laches to set
in.  This is fatal to his case.  Laches is failure or neglect, for an
unreasonable length of time to do that which by exercising due diligence could
or should have been done, earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a
right within a reasonable time warranting a presumption that the party entitled
to assert it either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
He could have intervened in Special Proceedings Nos. Q-10004 and Q-11074.  He did not do so.  He cannot feign ignorance of the existence of the said cases as
he was actually waiting for their final disposition before asserting his own
rights.  Neither did he raise fraud nor
cry out for the improper execution of the deed of assignment prior to the
instant action.  He never confronted
petitioner about his alleged share in the estate of the deceased in the period
between 1966<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
and 1970<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>,
thus, raising the incontrovertible conclusion that fraud never attended the
execution of the deed of assignment.  He
decided to holler foul and raise the defense of fraud only upon learning that a
compromise agreement was entered into by the petitioner, the
Francisco-Zaragozas, and the Periquets.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, fraud is a question of fact and the circumstances
constituting the same must be alleged and proved in the court below.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The allegations of fraud, deception, gross misrepresentation, or undue
influence were not proved in court, hence, the same must fail.  Fraud and other vices of consent must be
established by full, clear, and convincing evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Therefore, the finding of the trial court as to its existence or non­existence
is final and cannot be reviewed save only when the finding is clearly shown to
be erroneous.  <span style="">We </span>perceive no error in the trial court's finding that the deed
of assignment is not tainted with fraud.  We reproduce said finding with approval:</p>

<blockquote>(P)laintiff's evidence which consist solely of his oral testimony
and the documentary evidence marked as exhibits, fail miserably to establish
the gross misrepresentation, deception, fraud, grave abuse of confidence,
mistake and undue influence allegedly employed on him to secure his consent to
and signature on the assignment of hereditary rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the first place, <u>plaintiff had in his deposition indeed given
inconsistent statements which cast serious doubts on his </u><u><span style="">credibility</span></u><span style="">.  </span>On direct examination,
plaintiff declared that he signed the deed of assignment of hereditary rights
in the house of the deceased (referring to the deceased Petra Francisco Vda. de
Periquet) at Ilang-Ilang (Deposition, Exhibit A, pp. 13-14).  Later plaintiff declared that he signed the
document at New Manila, Quezon City (Id., p. 19).  He declared that the assignment of hereditary rights was signed
at midnight (Id., p. 13).  Later on
cross-examination, plaintiff declared that it was daytime when he signed (Id.,
p. 10).  Also on direct examination,
plaintiff declared that he did not read the assignment of hereditary rights
before or at the time he signed (Id., p. 13).  But on cross-examination he declared that he read a portion of the same
(Id., pp. 68-69).</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>There is ample evidence that plaintiff signed the deed of
assignment of hereditary rights freely and voluntarily and was fully aware of
the contents, import and meaning of the document</u>.  Thus, to the question, 'what did Dr. Fernando Periquet, Jr., tell
you, if any, before signing this document?', plaintiff's answer was, 'He
promised me to get the whole amount of P10,000.00 without any consent of his
mother, personally, secret between us.' (Deposition, Exh. A, p. 18).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The third 'Whereas' clause of the deed of assignment of hereditary
rights states:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'WHEREAS, the ASSIGNOR knows for a fact that the said deceased
under the Last Will and Testament which she has caused to be prepared but which
she was not able to sign, has given, devised and bequeathed to Dr. Fernando
Periquet, Jr. her entire estate with the exception of the sum of FIFTY THOUSAND
PESOS (P50,000.00) which she has bequeathed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>and the fact is undisputed that defendant
Fernando Periquet, Jr., was since he was just a few days old adopted (though
not judicially) by the deceased spouses Fernando Periquet and Petra Francisco,
and lived with, served and cared for the said spouses for forty-six (46) years
up to the time of their demise.  Just
prior to her death, Petra Francisco Vda. de Periquet caused the preparation of
a will leaving her entire estate, with the exception of certain legacies, to defendant,
but death supervened and the will was left unsigned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It must also be noted, and this is also important, that on the same
occasion that plaintiff signed the deed of assignment of hereditary rights,
Exhibit B, Marta Francisco Reyes also signed a similar assignment of hereditary
rights, Exhibit 2-Periquet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The reason why plaintiff later changed his mind is also disclosed
in his testimony on cross-examination.  The reason is, 'Because when I was sent a telegram by my niece Gloria
Zaragoza wherein it is stated that I have a share in the amount of P100,000.00,
the telegram is in the possession of the defendant, he did not return it to me
anymore after I have shown it to him.' (Deposition, Exh. A, p. 42).  To a further question on cross-examination,
'My question is this Mr. Francisco, if the doctor complied with his promise
here and gave you the P10,000.00 you will not complain anymore, is it not?',
plaintiff's answer was, 'No, I will complain too.' To the follow-up question,
'Why?', the answer was, 'To complete the P100,000.00.' The succeeding question
was, 'Who told you that you deserve P100,000.00?', the answer was, 'My niece
who received P100,000.00 too, Gloria Zaragoza' (Deposition, Exh. A, p. 81).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Assuming that plaintiff did not know or was not aware of the
contents and import of the assignment of hereditary rights, Exhibit B, when he
signed the same on the night of August 3, 1966, it is impossible he did not
come to know at least the import or the consequences of the same a few days
after.  <u>The evidence is unrebutted
that plaintiff was defendant's go between or intermediary in securing from
Zacarias Zaragoza and Gloria Zaragoza-Nunez the latter's consent and signatures
to the assignment of hereditary rights, Exhibits M and I.  On this point defendant testified, 'I was
with Felix Francisco.  He was the one
who was very instrumental in helping me out on looking where these cousins of
mine live and at the same time to convince them to sign the assignment of
hereditary rights in my favor for he has signed a similar document'</u> (t.s.n.
- Rivera, Oct. 23, 1973, pp. 31-32).  <u>Plaintiff
in fact was with defendant in Iloilo when defendant secured the signatures of
Zacarias Zaragoza and Gloria Zaragoza Nunez to the assignments of hereditary
rights, Exhibits H and I, on August 11, 1966--eight (8) days after plaintiff
signed the assignment of hereditary rights, Exh. B</u>.  Plaintiff was also with defendant when the
latter approached Florentino Zaragoza but Florentino refused to sign
(t.s.n.-Rivera, Oct. 23, 1973, pp. 30-31; 33).  The point is, <u>if plaintiff was in truth deceived by defendant, if it
were that he had given his consent to and signature on the assignment of
hereditary rights, Exhibit B, because of 'gross misrepresentation and deception
and fraud', 'grave abuse of confidence', 'mistake and undue influence' employed
on him by defendant, he would not have waited until May 16, 1970 -- almost four
(4) years after he signed Exhibit B, to file this case</u>.  At the expense of being repetitious, it is
impossible, after helping defendant get the signatures of Zacarias Zaragoza
(the last of whom refused) to similar assignment of hereditary rights that
plaintiff did not become aware at least from that time of the import and
consequence of the assignment of hereditary rights he signed.  After the widow Petra Francisco Vda. de
Periquet died without having signed the will which she had asked defendant's
lawyer to prepare, the deeds of assignment of hereditary rights which
plaintiff, among others were asked to sign, was the last resorted (sic) to keep
the estate of the deceased spouses in the hands of the defendant.  <u>Plaintiff obviously knew of the purpose
of the several assignment of hereditary rights and was in fact instrumental in
securing the consent and signatures of at least two of the heirs -- Zacarias
and Gloria </u>-- and failed in one-­Florentino.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Equally as weighty, the testimonies of the witnesses to the
assignment of hereditary rights, Exhibit 'E',-- Antonio Eugenio and Elias
Fermin - are positive and convincing that plaintiff signed Exhibit B freely and
voluntarily after reading the same and after being asked by defendant's
counsel, Atty. Guytingco, whether he understands the contents of the same</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphasis ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we agree with the petitioner that respondent court erred
in disturbing the proceedings conducted in Special Proceedings Nos. Q-10004 and
Q­11074, and the decrees and orders issued pursuant thereto.  It cannot be denied that a compromise
agreement was entered into by the parties in that case in order to end the suit
already filed in court.  The same was
approved by the trial court in the order dated December 20, 1969.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Well-settled is the rule that a compromise agreement, once approved by the
court, cannot and should not be disturbed except for vices of consent or
forgery, it being the obvious purpose of such compromise agreement to settle,
once and for all, the claims of the parties, and bar all future disputes and
controversies thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> A
compromise agreement cannot bind persons who are not parties thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither would a person not party to a compromise agreement be entitled to
enforce the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, a person who is not a party to an agreement, as in this case, cannot
seek the amendment or modification of the same.  Neither can a court of law rule that the compromise agreement be
amended and modified pursuant only to the wishes of a person not party to the
said agreement.</p>
