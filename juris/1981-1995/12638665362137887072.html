				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner asks the Court to declare null and void a Decision
dated <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="5">26 May 1989</st1:date> of the
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC Case No. NCR-00-09-03225-87
and to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reinstate the Decision of the
Labor Arbiter which the NLRC had modified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> was the former
President of private respondent Harrison Industrial Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
("<st1:place>Union</st1:place>").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because he was widely believed to have grossly mismanaged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Union affairs, the other officers of the </span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Union</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> formed an investigating committee and
several times invited petitioner </span><span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> to
answer the complaints and charges against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These charges were, principally:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Conspiring with the
company during the negotiation of the CBA, resulting in, among other things,
Article 22 entitled "Retirement" which provided for retirement pay of
one (1) day’s basic salary for every year of service.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Paying attorney's fees
to Atty. Federico <span class="SpellE">Leynes</span>, Union counsel, out of Union
funds without obtaining corresponding receipts <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Unilaterally increasing
the membership dues by an additional P17.00 per member in order to pay
increased attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Concealing the CBA,
failure to present and to explain the provisions of the same prior to
ratification by the union membership.<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Refusal to turn over the
custody and management of Union funds to the Union treasurer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, however, failed to
respond to the calls or invitations made by the investigating committee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the investigating committee called a
general membership meeting on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="6">11 June
 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this general
membership meeting, the charges against petitioner were presented and discussed
and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> decided to file <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>petition for special election of
its officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="6">16 June 1987</st1:date>,
a petition for special election of officers was filed by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
with the Bureau of Labor Relations, Department of Labor and Employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Several hearings were held at the BLR, always
with due notice to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>; petitioner,
however, failed to appear even once.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="8">5 August 1987</st1:date>,
a general Union membership meeting was h<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">eld
for </span>the impeachment of <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The general membership found <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> guilty of the above-mentioned charges and decided to
expel him from the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and to recommend his
termination from employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty.
Federico <span class="SpellE">Leynes</span> also ceased to be counsel for the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Union accordingly informed private respondent Harrison
Industrial Corporation ("Company") of the expulsion of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> from the Union and demanded application of the Union
Security Clause of the then existing Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) on
15 September 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> received a letter of termination from the Company,
effective the next day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, now represented by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Leynes</span>, the former lawyer of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>,
filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="10">7
 October 1988</st1:date>, the Labor Arbiter held that there was no just cause
for the dismissal of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, none of the
causes for suspension or dismissal of Union members enumerated in the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s
Constitution and By-Laws being applicable to petitioner's situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter also held that the manner
of petitioner's dismissal had been in disregard of the requirements of notice
and hearing laid down in the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Labor Arbiter ordered petitioner's reinstatement with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and payment of attorney's fees, the monetary
liability to be borne <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> by the Company and
the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Company and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> went on appeal
before the public respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC, in a Decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="5">26 May 1989</st1:date>, reversed the Labor
Arbiter's award.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC noted that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> had merely denied the serious
charges of mismanagement <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> against him, as
set out in the affidavit of Dante <span class="SpellE">Maroya</span>, the
incumbent President of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, which affidavit had
been adopted by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>its position paper in the proceedings before the Labor
Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC held <span class="SpellE">Cariño's</span> silence as "tantamount to (an) admission of
guilt" and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>constituting
the ultimate cause for his dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the NLRC agreed with the Labor Arbiter's finding that the
manner of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño's</span> dismissal was
inconsistent with the requirements of due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC accordingly found the Company and
the Union <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable, "by way of penalty
and financial assistance", to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>
for payment of separation pay, at the rate of one-half (1/2) month's salary for
each year of service.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> basically seeks reinstatement of the Decision of the
Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> contended that the NLRC had erred in taking
cognizance of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s admittedly late appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree, however, with the Solicitor General
that it is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>settled principle
of remedial law that reversal of a judgment obtained by a party appealing from
it also benefits a co-party who had n<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ot
</span>appealed, or who had appealed out of time, where the rights and
liabilities of both parties under the modified decision are so interwoven and
inter-dependent <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>to be
substantively inseparable.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the NLRC could take cognizance of the late
appeal of the Union, considering that the lawfulness of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño's</span> dismissal by the Company could be determined <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only </span>after ascertaining, among other
things, the validity of the Union’s act of expelling <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>
from its membership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the
Company having seasonably appealed the Labor Arbiter's Decision and the
Company's and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s liability being closely
intertwined, the NLRC could properly take account of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s
appeal even though not seasonably filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC in effect held
that there had been just cause for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño's</span>
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court considers that the
NLRC was correct in so holding, considerin<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">g</span>
the following documentary provisions:</p>

<p class="BODY">a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Article II, Sections 4

<p class="BODY">It appears to the Court that the particular charges raised
against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, set out earlier,
reasonably fall within the underscored provisions of the foregoing

this when it described the charges of mismanagement against <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>
as serious.</p>

involvement of the Company in the dismissal of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>,
we note that the Company upon being formally advised in writing of the
expulsion of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> from the Union, in
turn simply issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>termination
letter to <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, the termination being made
effective the very next day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We believe
that the Company should have given petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>
an opportunity to explain his side of the controversy with the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>'s
Security Clause in the CBA, the Company should have reasonably satisfied itself
by its own inquiry that the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> had not been merely
acting <span class="SpellE">arbitarily</span> and capriciously in impeaching and
expelling petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From what was already discussed above, it is
quite clear that had the Company taken the trouble to investigate the acts and
proceedings of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, it could have very easily
determined that the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> had <u>not</u> acted
arbitrarily in impeaching and expelling from its ranks petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Company
offered the excuse that the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> had threatened to go
on strike if its request had not been forthwith granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that such a threat had in fact been
made, if a strike was in fact subsequently called because the Company had
insisted on conducting its own inquiry, the Court considers that such would
have been <u>prima facie</u> an illegal strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Company also pleaded that for it to inquire into the lawfulness of
the acts of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> in this regard would constitute
interference by the Company in the administration of Union affairs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe so.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court does not believe, however, that the grant of separation

</span>Since petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> had clearly disdained
answering the charges <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> against him within
the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>, there was no reason to suppose that if the

appeared in a Company investigation and pleaded his defenses, if he had any,
against the charges against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There

petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span> before his own Union, the Court
