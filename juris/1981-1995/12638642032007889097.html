<p class="BODY">The incriminatory facts of these three (3) cases, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>contained in the People's Brief,
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On October 18, 1977, between eight and nine o'clock in the
morning <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> <span class="SpellE">Lucinario</span>
together with his wife Barbara and his daughter Elnora went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Servando</span> of <span class="SpellE">Sirab</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span>
sought the assistance of <span class="SpellE">Servando</span> in connection with
the destruction of their land allegedly by Oscar and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span> who, they likewise alleged, threatened and intended
to kill them (TSN <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>, December 18, 1979, pp.
55, 56).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unable to provide assistance to
the <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span>, <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>,
on the same day, reported the matter to <span class="SpellE">Dagami</span>
Station Commander Captain Andrade who, forthwith, summoned to a conference both
the <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span> and Oscar and Santiago <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span>, and advised them to come to an agreement as they
belong to the same family (Id., pp. 57 and 58).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently nothing positive resulted from the conference as the parties
failed to meet later in the afternoon after being asked to do so by Captain
Andrade to further thresh out and settle the dispute (Id., p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span>59).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The following day or on <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1977</st1:date> at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening while <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span>
was having supper with his wife at their house and while their children were
resting at their <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, someone knocked on the kitchen
door identifying himself as <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span> (TSN, I. <span class="SpellE">Lucinario</span>,
November 13, 1980, p. 8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span> was allowed in
by Barbara who, when asked by the former on whether he was included in the
complaint they made with the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain,
answered that he (<span class="SpellE">Berting</span> <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span>)
is not included in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Id., p. 9).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly
Oscar <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span> pushed aside the kitchen door and after
gaining entry started hacking Barbara with a bolo which was about thirty (30)
inches long (Id., p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Barbara fell
after she was hit, and immediately both <span class="SpellE">Gualberto</span> and
Oscar jumped out of the house (Id., p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> after
closing the kitchen door and securing the same with a bamboo lock carried
Barbara who was then bleeding profusely up the house and treated her wound by applying
thereon a crushed penicillin tablet placed in <span class="GramE">a cotton</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Id., p. 11) While <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span>
was administering to his wife, he heard Santiago <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span>
giving instructions to his companions to push the door with a wood to gain
entry inside the house and to kill all the occupants thereon including the children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Id., p. 11) Forthwith, the door was rammed
and appellants were able to enter the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiter</span>
immediately hacked with a bolo <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> hitting him
on his left and right arms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Id., p. 13)
Before Santiago and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span> could join <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quiter</span> in the attack, <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> jumped out of the window landing first on the
porch and then on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Id., p. 14).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants chased <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> who fled to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>
which was about half a kilometer away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Id., p. 15) Upon reaching the aforesaid house, <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span>
found that <span class="SpellE">Servando</span> was not there.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While the physical attack on the <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span>
was going on, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Tobe</span>, a neighbor of the
former, acting on the cries for help emanating from the house of the <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span> proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>
to report the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Servando</span> then went to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> to ask for police
assistance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>,
December 18, 1979, p. 62) Unfortunately, however, the needed police assistance
could not be provided as there was only one policeman who was manning the
police station (Id., pp. 60, 61).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Servando</span> returned to his house
after leaving word to the policeman on duty, <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bod-oy</span>, that when the other policeman shall have
arrived that they proceed immediately to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sirab</span>
as their assistance is [sic] needed (Id., p. 61).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"Meanwhile, appellants
discontinued chasing </span><span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> and returned to
the latter's house and upon seeing Elnora <span class="SpellE">Lucinario</span>,
tried to hack her with bolos (TSN, E. <span class="SpellE">Lucinario</span>, July
8, 1981, p. 13).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant(s) did not
succeed in hitting Elnora as her mother, Barbara, came to the rescue and
protected her by swinging his [sic] arms (Id., p. 114) which allowed her
(Elnora) to run and hide inside her room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants then concentrated their attack on Barbara who pleaded that
her life be spared (TSN, L. <span class="SpellE">Lucinario</span>, February 24,
1981, pp. 79, 80).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her pleas fell on
deaf ears as appellants continued hacking <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Barbara fell down on the floor after
receiving the blows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellants then
dragged </span>her - with Oscar holding her hair, <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span>
her shoulder, <span class="SpellE">Berting</span> her breast and <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
her feet - and brought her out of the house and left her on the road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This provided Elnora with the opportunity to
escape and join her father, who himself had escaped earlier, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">[sic] </span>at the house <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellants again went back to </span>the
house of the <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span> and ransacked the house
taking away all the money and the jewelries that they could find (Id., p. 82).</blockquote>

and Elnora waiting for him (TSN, E. <span class="SpellE">Lucinario</span>, July
8, </span>1981, p. 118) both of whom narrated the hacking incident that had
just happened at their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a
while, Sgt. Jose <span class="SpellE">Catoligo</span>, responding to the call for
assistance of <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>, arrived (TSN, <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>, December 18, 1978, p. 63).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except for <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span>,
they all proceeded to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span>
(TSN, <span class="SpellE">Servando</span>, December 18, 1978, p. 64).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Along the way, however, they found the dead
body of Barbara lying near the ditch on the left side of the road fourteen (14)
meters from the house of the <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, they proceeded to the house of
the <span class="SpellE">Lucinarios</span> and found that appellants were no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">longer there and their house had been
ransacked.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

6 and 7 (Id., pp. 13-15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other
wounds while not necessarily fatal contributed to her death (Id., p. 16).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wound No. 1 was on the forehead, 2 inches
long and one inch deep (TSN, November 20, 1979. pp. 29, 33).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wounds 2, 3, 4 and 6 were sustained in the

the distal portion of the forearm (TSN, November 20, 1979, pp. 28, 34).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wound No. 6 was sustained at the base of the
skull (Id., p. 30).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wound No. 9 was
sustained at the left posterior portion of the chest cavity (Id., p. 31).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wound No. 11 is 6 inches long, 2 inches wide
injuring the muscle tissues in the deltoid portion (Id., p. 28, 36).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death was shock due to profuse

There is no special complex crime of robbery in band with double homicide
and/or serious, less serious or slight physical injuries under the present
Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 373.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If robbery with homicide (or with the other crimes enumerated above) is
committed by a band, the indictable offense would still be denominated as
‘robbery with homicide’ under Article 294(1), but the circumstance that it was
committed by a band is not an element of the crime but is merely a generic
aggravating circumstance which may be offset by mitigating circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The homicides or murders and physical
injuries, irrespective of their numbers, committed on the occasion or by reason
of the robbery are merged in the composite crime of ‘robbery with
homicide.’"</blockquote>

the offense committed is robbery <u>with</u> homicide, since the original
design of the accused-appellants was to kill and the taking of the money and
jewelry belonging to the deceased Barbara <span class="SpellE">Lucinario</span>
was but an afterthought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prevailing
rule is that "where the original design comprehends robbery in a dwelling,
and homicide is perpetrated with a view to the consummation of said offense,
the crime committed is the complex offense even though homicide precedes the
robbery by an appreciable interval of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, if the original criminal design does not clearly
comprehend robbery, but robbery follows the homicide as an afterthought or as a
minor incident of the homicide, the criminal acts should be viewed as
constitutive of two offenses and not as a single complex offense."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

by the number and gravity of the wounds inflicted upon the deceased Barbara <span class="SpellE">Lucinario</span> and the fact that she was dragged outside her
