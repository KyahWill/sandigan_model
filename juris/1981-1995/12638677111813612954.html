<p class="BODY">The accused pleaded "not guilty", and although he admitted
having taken the life of the victim, Noel ("Bo<span style="">y</span>") <span class="SpellE">Rimon</span>, he allegedly did so in
defense of his own person.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his order of <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="7">July 14,

set the case for reception of evidence for the defense, to establish
self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense first presented Arthur Castor, a <span style="">driver, </span>and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Libacao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that on July <span style="">8, 1986, he was aboard a bus, a passenger
truck operated by the <span class="SpellE">Seraspi</span> company returning from
Iloilo City to <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>,
driven by the victim, when, at or about five o'clock in the afternoon, and
after the vehicle had parked near the Castillo monument in <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, he was distracted by an argument going on
between the victim and the accused, about a certain "<span class="SpellE">clutchbag</span>
which Edgar would like to bring to the municipal hall."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The accused allegedly then alighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim, however, tailed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly then saw the victim hacking the
accused with a bolo he had kept under his seat, which the latter parried, but
which decked him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Thereafter, the
accused reached inside the <span class="SpellE">clutchbag</span> in question,
from which a twenty-two caliber automatic pistol emerged, which the accused
aimed at the victim and which he fired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first shot allegedly hit the victim in the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fired two more shots both of which also
found <span style="">their mark.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He also declared that he was at the rear portion of the bus at
that time as the two protagonists struggled <span style="">outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he was
the only passenger by then.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense likewise presented <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Loresco</span>, a medical records librarian at the Dr.
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Tumbokon</span> Memorial Hospital in <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Andagao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Aklan</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She averred that on <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1986</st1:date>, the <span style="">accused was admitted to the hospital for treatment of hacking
wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused allegedly suffered

for <span class="SpellE">Seraspi</span> <span class="GramE">bus company</span>,</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">while
the victim drove it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended that </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the bus unloaded passengers and cargo near the Castillo monument, in <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, he and the victim tangled in an argument concerning
a <span class="SpellE">clutchbag</span> which he allegedly found in one of the
bus seats, and which contained a firearm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He allegedly sought to surrender it to the <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>
police, but the victim allegedly insisted that they keep it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly alighted, anyway, on his way to
the police station, the <span class="SpellE">clutchbag</span> tied around his
arm, when allegedly, "somebody shouted and when I looked back, I saw that
it was Boy <span class="SpellE">Rimon</span> and he was already hacking me and I
was hit here on </span><span style="">my </span><span style="">left arm."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> He allegedly retreated, but the victim
allegedly </span><span class="SpellE">boloed</span> away, hitting him on the left
breast and later, the left arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
allegedly rolled over to a canal, opened the <span class="SpellE">clutchbag</span>,
and reached for the gun, with which he shot the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shot him three times until he, the victim,
fell and died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that when he
fired at him, he was lying on the ground while the victim stood about a meter
away.</p>

<p class="BODY">He later surrendered to the municipal authorities and turned over
the firearm to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was also
brought to the Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tumbokon</span> Memorial Hospital when
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span> treated him for bolo wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, he testified that he and the victim were
alone in the bus when they began exchanging words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also admitted knowing how to operate a
motorcycle, being a motocross racer, and that he had joined racing
competitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense then rested, and the prosecution presented rebuttal
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution put Bobby <span class="SpellE">Masangya</span>, of <span class="SpellE">Batan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, on the stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified that on <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="7">July
 8, 1986</st1:date> he boarded a <span class="SpellE">Seraspi</span> bus headed
for <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was driven by the victim, and in which the accused was the inspector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that accused actually alighted
at the New Washington-<span class="SpellE">Banga-­Kalibo</span> intersection, and
jumped off it while the bus was in motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bus later stopped at <st1:street><st1:address>D. <span class="SpellE">Maagma</span>

 <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">He subsequently saw the accused on a motorcycle proceeding toward
the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that he was then a
seat behind the driver, by the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
were allegedly about twenty-five other passengers on board the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused then supposedly parked his
motorcycle, dismounted, and "he had with him a clutch bag and he went <span style="">round the portion of the bus where the driver
was situated then opened his clutch bag, took a gun and [shot] the
driver."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> He allegedly shot him outside the bus, from
the driver's window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Masangya</span> said he rose and dashed toward the back of the bus
and jumped out of the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He heard
two more gunshots thereafter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He also asserted that he did not hear any conversation preceding
the shooting between the accused and the victim, and that the accused did not
carry anything when he first got off the bus.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the first shot, the other passengers likewise allegedly scurried in all
directions and scampered for safety.</p>

<p class="BODY">Felipe <span class="SpellE">Reprado</span>, of <span class="SpellE">Banga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, corroborated <span class="SpellE">Masangya's</span>
testimony, and alleged that "[s]<span class="SpellE">omebody</span> arrived
riding a motorcycle and parked it in front of the <span class="SpellE">Seraspi</span>
<span style="">Mini Bus and then he drew a gun from
his waist and shot the driver on his seat."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He said that he was at the "Youth Hostel" along <span class="SpellE">Maagna</span> Street at that time, about twelve meters from the
bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the first shot, he said that
the driver, his face bleeding, stood up brandishing a bolo, after which he
heard two shots more.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Esteban <span class="SpellE">Villaruel</span>, of the Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tumbokon</span> Memorial Hospital, testified that it was he who
prepared the <span style="">medico-legal report of the

<p class="BODY">Police lieutenant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Seraspi</span>, of <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, then <span style="">officer-in-charge
</span><span style="">of the <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>
Integrated National Police, claimed that the accused, on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="7"><span style="">July </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, went
to the station to surrender a firearm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused was allegedly on a motorcycle when he arrived at the
station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also appeared bloodied, for
which reason, he was advised to check into a hospital, the </span><span style="">Dr. <span class="SpellE">T<span style="">umbokan</span></span></span><span style=""> Memorial, about 200 meters away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He identified the firearm to <span style="">be a </span>"Rohm", with serial No. 44600, with three live
ammunition and three empty shells in the cylinder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge found the evidence for the prosecution more
convincing and compatible with claims that the accused had been guilty of
murder, qualified by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
sentenced the accused <span style="">to </span>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, taking into consideration the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender, offset, however, by the generic
aggravating circumstance of evident premeditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was also adjudged to indemnify
the heirs of the deceased <span style="">in </span>the
amount of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we <span style="">said, </span>we
affirm, save for certain modifications, the judgment under appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the accused shot the victim, three
times, which caused his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
question is whether or not he shot him in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence before the trial court, as found
by the judge, indicated that it was plain murder and that it was the victim, in
hacking away at the accused, which also caused some injuries to the latter, who
was in fact defending himself from the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The errors raised by the
defense have to do with the assessment of the believability of the witnesses’
testimonies, and we have held time and again that credibility of witnesses is a
matter we leave, as a general rule, to the trial judge to determine.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This <span style="">is </span>so because first, the
Supreme Court does not try facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
office is preeminently, to review errors of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No valid reason has been advanced why <span style="">we </span>should depart <span style="">from </span>the rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence indeed discloses that the accused, contrary to his
story, had earlier alighted from the bus, followed it via a motorcycle, parked
it as the bus <span style="">parked, slinked around
it, and shot the deceased from the window.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two reasons persuade the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">First, the witness', Bobby <span class="SpellE">Macangya's</span>
testimony, wherein he categorically declared that the accused acted in the
manner above-described.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As </span><span style="">the court </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">quo did, we find his testimony to be
forthright, candid, and persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused has not successfully shown any improper motive why Mr. <span class="SpellE">Masangya</span> should perjure his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, it jibes with the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
very evidence that he knew how to operate a motorcycle, and the fact that he
was seen riding one and arrived at the crime scene on one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third, police <span class="GramE">lieutenant</span>
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Seraspi</span>, testified that the accused arrived
at the station aboard a motorcycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> bare denials that he had been all along on board
the bus can not overcome these positive testimonies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Masangya</span> maintained that
the accused drew his pistol from a <span class="SpellE">clutchbag</span>, while
Felipe <span class="SpellE">Reprado</span> said that he reached for it from his
waist, does not contradict <span class="SpellE">meaningfuly</span> the finding
that he did draw a firearm and that he shot the deceased with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At best, the <span style="">conflicting testimonies involve an inconsistency on an insignificant
footnote explained, first, by the swift turn of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">events that had
unfolded, and second, by the frailty of human memory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the accused admits having shot
the victim, and whether he shot him with a gun he kept in a <span class="SpellE">clutchbag</span>
or tucked under his waist, the fact remains that he </span>had <span style="">a</span><span style="">
</span>g<span style="">un, and that he shot the victim
with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We can not accept the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> claim
of self-defense, first, because he has not convincingly shown it amid the ample
proofs that he was not defending himself, but rather, was committing
cold-blooded murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of
defense witness Arthur Castor, to the effect that he was <span style="">the lone</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">passenger who witnessed
the event, is belied by the fact that </span><span class="SpellE">Masangya</span>,
<span style="">for one, and <span class="SpellE">Reprado</span>,
for another, had come forward to testify that there were other passengers
aboard, and that they numbered around twenty-five.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused can not point to his <span style="">injuries </span>to illustrate <span style="">self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the evidence shows is that after he
fired his first shot, the victim did not die immediately, although normally it
would have been fatal, but managed to alight from the bus and swing away with
his bolo for which </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">accused fired at him </span>again--twice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villaruel</span></span><span style=""> </span>himself, <span style="">in </span><span style="">reply </span><span style="">to the questioning:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"...could the victim inflict those
wounds to the accused after he was shot...</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> stated that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is possible."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Indeed,
</span><span style="">the </span><span style="">records </span><span style="">show that the accused sustained but minor wounds, which did not </span>require
confinement, and which <span style="">give rise to
valid inferences that the victim had been weakened and had swung at the accused
indiscriminately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This <span style="">was in fact confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Masangya</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Reprado</span> that after the first shot, the deceased
rose wielding a bolo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records indeed suggest that the victim had managed <span style="">to </span><span style="">get off his seat, exit from the bus, and follow his assailant outside
(notwithstanding his facial wound) since <span class="GramE">he</span>, the
victim, was found lying on the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not therefore farfetched to say that the deceased <span style="">could </span>still have attacked the accused
with his bolo although he had already been injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two things convince us:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Reprado</span>,
prosecution witness, testified that he saw the victim stand up after the first
shot was fired; and <span style="">(2) while he did
not see what transpired later, the evidence on record shows that the victim
fell on the ground, outside the bus, which means that he was able to leave the
vehicle, and that judging from the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> admitted
bodily cuts, he managed to bolo, without fatal success, the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As the Solicitor General further observes, the shots came at
intervals, in Mr. <span class="SpellE">Reprado's</span> language, "(p<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">erhaps</span></span> <span style="">two (2) minutes,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> meaning, that, there was activity after the
first shot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That the offense was attended by treachery is adequately
buttressed by the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
law, treachery involves a mode of attack adopted by the culprit to insure
consummation with no risk to <span class="GramE">himself</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span style="">circumstances herein show that the
accused had alighted from the bus, </span>rode on a <span style="">motorcycle, pursued the bus, and once it had parked, snaked around it
and shot its driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the victim
did not die immediately, the attack made on him was sudden, without warning,
and which caught him with his guards down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We can not say that the victim had insinuations that the accused would
commit a dastardly act because of their earlier </span>altercation, assuming <span style="">that there </span>was <span style="">such an altercation, because a brief interval had passed between that
and the actual act of shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Albeit
in one case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the Court held that where the victim was
able to retreat, although the attack was sudden, </span><span class="SpellE">alevosia</span>
<span style="">can not be appreciated, the Court can
not apply that case here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case,
the </span>victim, <span style="">upon retreating was
able to defend himself, and he can not be said to have been defenseless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, however, the accused had wounded the
victim--as a consequence of his surprise attack--and if he, the victim,
happened to "defend” <span class="GramE">himself,</span> it was no defense
at all, although he was able to inflict superficial wounds on the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">We rule out, however,
evident premeditation (which the trial court appreciated as a generic
aggravating circumstance) because in evident premeditation, the time the
accused had mustered the determination to commit the <span style="">crime must be well-established.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not shown here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court is put to task
in appreciating voluntary surrender as a mitigating circumstance because all
that the records reveal is that the accused trooped to the <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>
police headquarters to surrender the firearm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not clear whether or not he also sought to submit his very person
to the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We leave him,
however, the benefit of the doubt, and consider his arrival at the police
station as an act of surrender.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There being one
mitigating circumstance, the accused is hereby sentenced to the minimum period
prescribed by law for the crime of murder, reclusion temporal maximum, and
pursuant to the indeterminate sentence law, he is sentenced to ten years and
one day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor, to eighteen years and one
day of reclusion temporal, and, in the light of the new policy of the Court, to
pay an increased indemnity of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from the
amount of P30,000.00 fixed by the trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, <span style="">this
appeal is DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused-appellant is SENTENCED to undergo imprisonment of ten (10) years and
one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor, to eighteen (18) years
