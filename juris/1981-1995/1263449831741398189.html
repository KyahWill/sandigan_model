				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is an automatic
review of the decision of the Court of First Instance of Iloilo dated April 17,
1979, con­victing <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>
of robbery with homicide, sentencing him to death and ordering him to pay the
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> an
indemnity of fifteen thousand pesos and the sum of two <span class="GramE">thousand</span>
pesos which he took from her (Criminal Case No. 8860).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue is whether the
trial court erred in con­victing the accused of robbery with homicide on the
basis </span>of his oral confession to the police station commander that he
committed that offense but which confession was repu­diated by him on the
witness stand and which was taken during custodial interrogation when the
accused was not informed of his rights to remain silent and to have counsel, as
required by section 20, Article IV of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no doubt as to
the <u>corpus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> or the com</span>mission
of robbery with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In the
evening of Sunday, October 24, 1976, <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Condino</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span></span><span style=""> <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, an octogenarian housekeeper living alone, was
feloniously killed in her house located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Banguit</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, Iloilo (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">She sustained two gaping wounds on the right cheek, two gaping
wounds on the neck, another gaping wound on the <span style="">right shoulder and a bruise on the cheek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A piece of wire, </span>which was used to
strangle her, was tied around her neck (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span style="">A). </span>A <span style="">scythe was sticking in her neck (Letter "B" in Sketch, p. 4,
Record).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Regarded as fatal by the examining physician was the wound in the
neck which pierced the jugular vein and which was connected with the other
wound in the neck and the shoul­der wound (14 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>
June 18, 1978).</p>

<p class="BODY">The gruesome crime was discovered in the afternoon of the
following day, October 25, by Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Prevendido</span>, the
<span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On noticing that the windows of the old woman's house had not been opened
in the morning, he sus­pected that there was something amiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Olmos</span>, the grandson of the old woman, to peep through the
bedroom window.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Olmos</span> informed <span class="SpellE">Prevendido</span>
that the old woman's things were scattered in the bedroom, he requested <span class="SpellE">Olmos</span> to <span style="">inform his
uncle, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, a son of the old woman, to
come to the house (p. 8, Record).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Salvador entered the house through the bedroom window and saw his
mother's lifeless and bloodied body near the kitchen with a wire coiled around
her neck and a scythe stuck in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
found that money and pieces of jewelry were missing (p. 7, Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mallet was found on the floor near the
victim's body.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police and the rural health physician were notified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span>
O. <span class="SpellE">Tormon</span>, Jr. and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Moneva</span>
repaired to the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the fact that cooked rice and viands were found on the stove, <span class="SpellE">Tormon</span> concluded that the crime was committed at suppertime
on <span style="">the preceding night (p. 11, Record).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No eyewitness testified as to the commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal evidence of the prosecution is
the testimony of Lieutenant Tomas C. Lujan, the chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lujan declared that <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
voluntarily confessed to him that he (<span class="SpellE">Severino</span>)
committed the robbery with homi­cide but <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
refused to sign a confession.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Severino</span></span><span style=""> implicated <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaya</span> of <span class="SpellE">Lambunao</span>, Iloilo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Lujan and his men brought <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> to <span class="SpellE">Macaya's</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lujan found that <span class="SpellE">Macaya</span>
had nothing to do with the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lujan further testified that <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
said that the money stolen from the old woman was in <span class="SpellE">Severino's</span>
house at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilawod</span>, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Banguit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lujan and his men went to <span class="SpellE">Severino's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not find the stolen
money.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Lujan was not the only
police officer who heard <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero's</span>
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Rolando N. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alag</span></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">a member of the arresting team that picked up <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>
and brought him to Lujan, stated in his sworn statement before the mayor that <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> admitted that he took part in the robbery with
homicide, that his companions were <span class="SpellE">Macaya</span> and a
certain Junior (whose parents were <span class="SpellE">Severino's</span>
godparents) and that it was he (<span class="SpellE">Severino</span>) who induced
the commission of </span>the crime (p. 9, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alag</span></span><span style=""> further swore that after <span class="SpellE">Macaya</span>
denied any par</span>ticipation in the commission of the crime, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> <span style="">admitted sole responsibility for it and
confessed that he </span><span style="">took </span>three
thousand pesos after hitting <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> on the head with a mallet, strangling her with a
piece of wire and hacking her with a scythe (p. 9, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to <span class="SpellE">Alag</span>, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Severino</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">said that the robbery with homicide was
committed on momentary impulse after <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, who had plenty of <span class="GramE">money,</span>
refused to lend him fifty pesos (Back of page 9, Record).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alag</span></span><span style=""> confirmed his sworn statement at the
preliminary examination when the municipal judge interrogated him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alag</span> </span>said
that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Severino</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> </span>made
his confession in the course of their <span style="">conversation
on the </span>way to the police station and not by reason of a formal
investigation (p. 22, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Alag</span></span><span style=""> clarified that, according to <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>, he had to kill <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> because the old woman recognized him as the intruder
(p. 22, Record).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Tormon</span></span><span style="">, another member of the arresting team, corroborated in his sworn
statement <span class="SpellE">Alag's</span> declaration as to <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero's</span> confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tormon</span> de­clared at
the preliminary examination that <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> </span>knew that <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> had money because, according to <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Fausta's</span> daughter <span class="SpellE">Mauring</span>
repaid to <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> the sum of one thousand one hundred
pesos (which amount <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> had not yet deposited in
the bank), another person named <span class="SpellE">Ayuy</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> paid to <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> her debt and
<span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> had ten sacks of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
(pp. 10 and 14, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tormon</span> said that <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
met <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> at a store in the morning of October 23,
1976 (the day before the crime was committed).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> was willing to lend <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
one hundred fifty pesos (p. 14, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Hudieras</span>, the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pamulogan</span>,
which adjoins Barrio <span class="SpellE">Banguit</span> where the old woman
resided, declared in his sworn statement that in the evening of October 26 (two
days after the commission of the crime) he was drinking liquor (<span class="SpellE"><u>biti-biti</u></span>) with <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> in the house of Valentino <span class="SpellE">Pambo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Hudieras</span>’ brother-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that occasion, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
told <span class="SpellE">Hudieras</span> that <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> was killed by clubbing her with a mallet, choking her
with a piece of wire and hacking her with a scythe (p. 6, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Hudieras</span></span><span style=""> stated that when he remarked that the best
thing to do was to kill the killer of <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> behaved in an
unnatural manner and said that <span class="SpellE">Hudieras</span> could testify
that he saw daily <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> harvesting <span class="SpellE">palay</span> ("<span class="SpellE">Si</span> ‘To boy <span class="SpellE">nga</span> <span class="SpellE">dya</span>, <span class="SpellE">baryo</span>

(p. 6, Record).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Hudieras</span> confirmed his affidavit at the
preliminary examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that
his suspicion was that <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>
killed <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> (p. 16,
Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">The sworn statements of <span class="SpellE">Alag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tormon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hudieras</span> and others
were the basis of the criminal complaint for rob­bery with homicide filed by
Lieutenant Lujan in the municipal <span style="">court
against <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not testify at the trial </span><span style="">most </span><span style="">probably because Lujan himself, the station commander, took the witness
stand to give evidence on the same oral confession allegedly made by <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> to the police.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To</span> reinforce and
render <span style="">credible Lujan’s </span>testimony
on <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Duero</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">’s</span>
oral confession of<span style=""> guilt, <span class="SpellE">T<span style="">r</span>anquilino</span></span>
<span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, a second cousin of the accused, testified that
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time><span style=""> in </span><span style="">the afternoon of </span><st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="10"><span style="">October 24, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, he met the </span><span style="">accu</span><span style="">sed in</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Barrio
<span class="SpellE">Tabucan</span> which is </span><span style="">about </span><span style="">two kilometers away
from the old woman's house in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Banguit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of their conversation, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> allegedly revealed to <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span>
that he (<span class="SpellE">Severino</span>) would rob his <span class="SpellE"><u>owao</u></span>
or grandmother, <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> said to
<span class="SpellE">Severino</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Are you an idiot?"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In answer, </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Severino</span></span><span style=""> explained that <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Duero</span> would not even lend him ten pesos or a <span class="SpellE">ganta</span> of rice, a fact known to one Roman <span class="SpellE">Sipaya</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day
when <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> learned from <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
that the old woman was killed, it oc­curred to <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span>
that <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> was responsible for the </span><span style="">killing (2</span><span style="">-</span><span style="">3 <span class="SpellE">ts<span style="">n</span></span></span><span style=""> March 10, 1978).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another prosecution
witness, Jose <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>, testified that about </span>six
<span style="">o'clock in the evening of October 24,
1976, when he passed by the house of <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, he saw <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> near the stairs of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Severino</span></span><span style=""> was calling the old woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Montaño</span> was just
about three meters away from </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Severino</span></span><span style=""> when <span class="SpellE">Mon­taño</span> p</span><span style="">assed
by him (6 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> April 21, </span><span style="">1978).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Montano's house was about one hundred meters away from <span class="SpellE">Fausta's</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was going to watch television in his uncle's house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Montaño</span> had known <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Duero</span> for about four years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was on friendly terms with <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
used to gather mangoes for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Montaño</u></span><u> was positive that <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
killed the old woman</u> (6 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> April 21, 1978).</p>

<p class="BODY">Another prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Senesal</span>), also a
resident of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pamulogan</span>, testified that at
six-thirty in the morning of October 25, 1976 or about ten hours after the
commission of the crime, <span class="SpellE">Cenizal</span> had a conversation
with <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Severino</span></span><span style=""> spontaneously revealed to <span class="SpellE">Cenizal</span> that he (<span class="SpellE">Severino</span>) helped
his grandmother (<span class="SpellE"><u>owao</u></span>, the colloquial term for
grandmother) who was "held up by the bandit" and that her money
amounting to two thousand pesos was taken from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Severino</span> recounted
to <span class="SpellE">Cenizal</span> that the old woman was struck in the head
with a hammer and wounded with a scythe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cenizal's</span></span><span style=""> testimony was a confirmation of his affi­davit
taken on October 30, 1976 by a policeman wherein he stated that, according to <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>, the old woman was killed by striking her with a
mallet, strangling her with a piece of wire and wounding her with a scythe and
that the money taken from the old woman was in a purse (<span class="SpellE"><u>buon-buon</u></span>)
placed in a bamboo basket (<span class="SpellE"><u>tabungos</u></span>) (p. 5,
Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cenizal</span>
confirmed his affidavit at the preliminary examination (p. 17, Record).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstantial evidence summarized above shows that the
prosecution had a strong case against <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> <span style="">in spite of
the absence of the testimony of an eyewitness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the trial no objection was interposed by the defense to the evi­dence
on </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Duero</span></span></st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">'s</span></span><span style=""> oral confession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, the trial court
on the basis of such evidence found <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> guilty
of robbery with homicide beyond rea­sonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not appeal from the trial court's deci­sion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But the trouble is that at the trial <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
repudiated his alleged oral confession and even claimed that he was mal­treated
by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lujan in his rebuttal
testimony denied the maltreatment.) <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> said
that the <span style="">victim </span>was "the <span style="">wife of my grandfather", meaning that
"the husband of <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>
(the victim) was </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">grandfather of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Duero</span></span><span style="">" </span><span style="">(28 and 37 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> January 5, 1979).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As alibi, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> testified that he
was in his house when the crime was perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>,
his neighbor Adriano Lopez and his friends, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Macaya</span> <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaya</span>, confirmed </span>his
alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero’s</span>
counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>in this Court contends that the trial
court erred in admitting the oral testimony on <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Duero's</span> oral confession, in giving credence to the
testimonies of Lujan, <span class="SpellE">Cenizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Montaño</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>, in <span style="">finding that </span>robbery with homicide was
committed and in not sustaining <span class="SpellE">Severino's</span> alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General agrees with the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio’s</u></span> contention that <span class="SpellE">Severino's</span>
oral confession is inadmissible in evidence by reason of Article IV of the
Constitution which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 20.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No person shall be compelled to be <span style="">a </span>wit­ness <span style="">against himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Any
person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the
right to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No force, vio­lence, threat, intimidation, or
any other means which vitiates the free <span style="">will
</span>shall be used against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
confession obtained in violation of this section shall be inadmissible in
evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All the foregoing
provisions are new except the first sentence, regarding the right against
self-incrimination </span>(<span class="SpellE"><u>nemo</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">tenetur</span> <span class="SpellE">seipsum</span> <span class="SpellE">accusare</span></u>), <span style="">which
is the only provision found </span><span style="">in
section 18 of the Bill of Rights of the 1935 Constitution, now revised or</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">expanded
in section 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See article 125 of the
Revised Penal Code and Republic Act No. 857 as to the right of the accused, who
is in police custody, to confer and communicate at anytime with his counsel.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If this case were to be
decided under the 1935 Constitution, the trial court's judgment of conviction
could be af­firmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we have to
decide it under the rule in the 1973 Constitution as to a confession obtained
while the confessant is under police custody.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And that rule applies squarely to this case (<span class="SpellE">Magtoto</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Manguera</span>, Simeon vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>
and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Isnani</span>, L-37201-02, L-37424 and
L-38929, March 3, 1975, 63 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Inasmuch as the
prosecution in this case failed to </span>prove <span style="">that before <span class="SpellE">Duero</span> made his alleged oral
confession he was informed </span>of <span style="">his
rights to <span class="GramE">remain</span> silent and to have counsel and
because there is no proof that he knowingly and intelligently waived those
rights, his confession is inadmissible in evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After discarding Lujan's
testimony on <span class="SpellE">Duero's</span> oral confession, the rest of the
prosecution's circumstantial evi­dence against him is not adequate for his
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His acquittal follows as a

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The new provisions in
section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution were adopted from the ruling in
Miranda vs. </span>Ari­zona, <span style="">384 U.S.
436, 16 L. Ed. 2nd 694 ("an earthquake in the world of law
enforcement") which specifies the following procedural safeguards for
in-custody interrogation of accused persons:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he
has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as
evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney,
either retained or appointed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant may waive effectuation of these rights,
provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If, however, he indicates in any manner and at any stage of
the process that he wishes to consult with an attor­ney before speaking there
can be no questioning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Likewise, if the individual is alone and indicates in any
manner that he does not wish to be interrogated, the po­lice may not question
him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The mere fact that he may have answered some questions or
volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive him of the right to
refrain from answering any further inquiries until he has consulted with an
attorney and thereafter consents to be questioned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As restated by Chief Justice Warren in the <u>Miranda</u> case,
the following procedure should be adhered to:</p>

<blockquote>"At the outset, if a person in custody is to be subjected to
interrogation, he must first be informed in clear and unequivocal terms that he
has the right to remain silent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For those unaware of the privilege, the warning is needed
simply to make them aware of it - the threshold requirement for an intelligent
decision as to its exercise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"More important, such a warning is an absolute pre-requisite
in overcoming the inherent pressures of the inter­rogation atmosphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Further, the warning will show the individual that his
interrogators are prepared to recognize his privilege should he choose to
exercise it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied
by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the
individual in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This warning is
needed in order to make him aware not only of the privi­lege, but also of the
consequences of forgoing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"An individual need not make a pre-interrogation request for a
lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While such request affirmatively
secures his right to have one, his failure to ask for a lawyer <span style="">does not constitute a waiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No effective waiver of the right to counsel
during interrogation can be recognized unless specifically made after the
warnings we here delineate have been given.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused who does not know his rights and therefore does not make a
request may be the person who most needs counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If an individual indicates that he wishes the assist­ance of
counsel before any interrogation occurs, the author­ities cannot rationally
ignore or deny his request on the basis that the individual does not have or
cannot afford a retained attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In order fully to apprise a person interrogated of the extent
of his rights under this system then, it is neces­sary to warn him not only
that he has the right to consult with an attorney, but also that if he is
indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is
clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the individual indicates in
any manner, at anytime prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain
silent, the interrogation must cease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the individual cannot obtain an attorney
and he indicates <span style="">that </span>he wants
one before speaking to police, they must respect his decision to remain
silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the interrogation continues without the presence of an
attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to
demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege
against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"An express statement that the individual is willing to make a
statement and does not want an attorney followed closely by a statement could
constitute a waiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The warnings required and the waiver necessary in accordance
with our opinion today are, in the absence of a fully effective equivalent,
prerequisites to the admissibility of any statement made by a defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the </span><u><span style="">Miranda</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">case, the Federal
Supreme Court made it clear that what is prohibited is the "<span class="GramE">incommunicado</span> interroga­tion of individuals in </span>a <span style="">police-dominated atmosphere, resulting in
self-incriminating statements without full warnings of consti­tutional
rights."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The State's right to prosecute
criminals may be a great right </span><span style="">but,
</span><span style="">as Lord Chancellor <span class="SpellE">Sankey</span> observed, it is not permissible "to do a great
right by doing a little wrong".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><u><span style="">Miranda</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">ruling does not mean
that the police should stop a person who enters a police station and states
that he wishes to confess to a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does not affect volunteered statements of guilt by persons not in police
custody.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the risk of repetitiousness, we reproduce here­under Chief
Justice Warren'<span style="">s </span>summary of the
procedural safeguards for persons in police custody where the interro­gation is
regarded as the commencement already of the trial or adversary system:</p>

<blockquote>"He (the accused) must be warned prior to any ques­tioning
that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against
him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney,
and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to
any questioning if he so desires.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout
the interrogation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After such warnings have been given, and such oppor­tunity
afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelli­gently waive these
rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But unless and until such warnings and waiver are
demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of
interrogation can be used against him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above procedure was
not followed by the police in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Duero's</span>
oral confession is inadmissible in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without that confession, the pro­secution's other </span><span style="">evidence </span><span style="">is not sufficient to </span><span style="">establish
<span class="SpellE">Duero's</span> guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the death penalty is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused is acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should be released immediately unless he
is being detained for another offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
