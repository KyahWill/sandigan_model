merely used as a tool by Atty. Ruiz<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>who
wanted to get back at the <span class="SpellE">Ucol's</span> because of a case

husband against Ruiz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was also
alleged to have made remarks that Atty. Ruiz instigated the complaint and fabricated
the charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">administrative case
was dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ruiz </span>decided to
file his own criminal complaint for libel against <span class="SpellE">Ucol</span>
based on the alleged libelous portion of <span class="SpellE">Ucol's</span>
answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, <span class="SpellE">Ucol</span> entered a plea
of not guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the proceedings in
the libel case, com­plainant Atty. Ruiz entered his appearance and partici­pated
as private prosecutor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the
lower court rendered judgment acquitting <span class="SpellE">Ucol</span> on the
ground that her guilt was not established beyond reasonable doubt. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>No pronouncement was made by the trial court
as to the civil liability of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of appealing the civil aspects of the case, Ruiz filed a
separate complaint for damages based on the same facts upon which the libel
case was founded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ucol</span> filed a motion to dismiss stating
that the action had prescribed and that the cause of action was barred by the
decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the criminal case
for libel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court granted the motion to dismiss on the ground of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, on appeal, the Court of
Appeals certified the case to us, the only issue being whether or not the civil
action for damages was already barred by the criminal case of libel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before going into the merit of this appeal, it is <span class="SpellE"><span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">noteworhty</span></span>
to mention that there are actually two cases now before <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">us </span>involving the contending parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Ucol</span> filed an "appeal by <i>certiorari</i>"
before this Court questioning the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">dissenting

<p class="BODY">Any ordinary student in law school should readily know that what
comprises <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>decision which can
be the subject of an appeal or a special <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">civil
</span>action is the majority opinion of the members of the court, but never
the dissenting opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, no
decision on appeal has as yet been rendered in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The act of the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
counsel in filing such a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>petition
defies logic or reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is totally in­explicable
how a member of the bar could be so careless or, if the act was deliberate,
could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">have </span>the courage to come
before this Court asking us to review a dissenting opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Counsel is warned that we do not find his
mistake in the slightest bit amusing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning now to the present appeal, plaintiff­-appellant Ruiz
contends that there can be no <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>
since nowhere in its decision did the trial court pass upon the civil aspect of
the criminal case nor did it make any express declaration that the fact on
which said case was predicated did not exist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He cites the pertinent provisions of Article 29 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Civil Code and Rule
III, Section 3 subsection (c) of the Rules of Court which respectively provide:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

may also mention Article 33 of the Civil Code which gives an offended party in

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In
acquitting <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Ucol</span>
of the libel charge, the trial court made these factual findings:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Clearly then, Atty. Ruiz filed the instant Criminal Case
against <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Ucol</span> as
retaliation for what he believed was an act of ingratitude to him on the part
of her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The precipitate haste
with <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">which the administrative complaint
was filed shows that he was the one personally interested in the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All that <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagaca</span> told him was double hearsay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The incident, if there was, happened between
the accused and <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> in the absence of </span><span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>; so that, all that <span class="SpellE">Ceferina</span>
allegedly told her, and she in turn told Atty. Ruiz, was undoubtedly double
deck hearsay; and Atty. Ruiz should therefore check the facts with <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span>, but he did not do that, and he did not even
present <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as a </span>witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For these
reasons, accused has every reason to believe that Atty. Ruiz was the <span class="GramE">author</span> who concocted the charges in the administrative
complaint and had his laundrywoman, complainant <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tagaca</span>, sign it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Agustina</span> has very little education and could
hardly speak English, yet the administrative complaint was written in polished
English, and who else but Atty. Ruiz could have authored those phrases in the
complaint:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'The retention of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Ucol</span> in this government service is inimical to the good
intentions of the Department to serve humanity and a disgrace and liability to
present administration.' As will be shown later <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">on, </span>it appears that it is this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">complaint </span>signed by <span class="SpellE">Agustina</span>, but
authored by Atty. Ruiz, that is libelous and not the respondent's answer; and
even, assuming that the administrative complaint may not have been impelled by
actual malice, the charge(s) were certainly reckless in the face of proven
facts and circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Court actions
are not established for parties to give bent to their prejudice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The poor and the humble are, as a general
rule, grate­ful to a fault, that intrigues and ingratitude are what they
abhor." <span class="GramE">(Amended Record on Appeal, pp. 8-10).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The findings in the criminal case, therefore, show a pattern of
harassment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, petitioner Ruiz had
something to do with the administrative complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, he filed a criminal case for libel
based on portions of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Ucol's</span> answer in the
administrative case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Third, he acted as
private prosecutor in the criminal case actively handling as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">lawyer </span>the
very case where he was the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And fourth, after the accused was acquitted on the basis of the facts
stated above, Atty. Ruiz pursued his anger at the <span class="SpellE">Ucols</span>
with implacability by filing a civil action for damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the trial judge, "court
actions are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span>established for
parties to give bent to their prejudice." This doubly true when the party
incessantly filing cases is a member of the bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

may still be determined in the criminal proceedings if the offended party does
not waive to have it adjudged, or does not reserve his right to institute a
separate civil action against the defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

bold">33 of the New Civil Code the injured party is not required to reserve her
right to institute the civil action, is not applicable to the present
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no showing in that case
that the offended party intervened in the prosecution of the offense, and the
amount of damages sought to be recovered was beyond the jurisdiction of the
criminal court so that a reservation of the civil action was useless or
unnecessary.) (<span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>,
