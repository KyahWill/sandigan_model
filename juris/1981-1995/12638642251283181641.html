his status as direct employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
principal, on the other hand, is made the indirect employer of the contractor's
employees for purposes of paying the employees their wages should the
contractor be unable to pay them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
joint and several liability facilitates, if not guarantees, payment of the
workers' performance of any work, task, job or project, thus giving the workers
ample protection as mandated by the 1987 Constitution [</span><b>See</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Article

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar, it is
beyond dispute that the security guards are the employees of EAGLE [<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">See</b> Article VII Sec. 2 of the Contract
for Security Services; G.R. No. 81447, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 34.]
That they were assigned to guard the premises of PTSI pursuant to the latter's
contract with EAGLE and that neither of these two entities paid their wage and
allowance increases under the subject wage </span>orders are also admitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">[<b>See</b> </span>Labor Arbiter's Decision,
p. 2; G.R. No. 81447, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 75.] Thus, the

appropriate [<b>See</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>Del
Rosario &amp; Sons Logging Enterprises, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 64204, May 31,
1985, 136 SCRA 669.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability of PTSI and
EAGLE, however, does not preclude the right of reimbursement from his co-debtor
by the one who paid [<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">See</b> Article
1217, Civil Code.] It is with respect to this right of reimbursement that
petitioners can find support in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
contractual stipulation and Wage Order provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Wage Orders are explicit that payment of the increases are
"to be borne" by the principal or client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"To be borne", however, does not
mean that the principal, PTSI in this case, would directly pay the security
guards the wage and allowance increases because there is no <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of contract between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The security
guardsâ contractual relationship is with their immediate employer, EAGLE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As an employer, EAGLE is tasked, among
others, with the payment of their wages [See Article, VII Sec. 3 of the
Contract for Security Services, <u>supra</u> and Bautista v. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, G.R. No. 52824, March 16, 1988, 158 SCRA 665.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there existed a contractual agreement between
PTSI and EAGLE wherein the former availed of the security services provided by
the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In return, the security
agency collects from its client payment for its security services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This payment covers the wages for the
security guards and also expenses for their supervision and training, the
guards' bonds, firearms with ammunitions, uniforms and other equipments,
accessories, tools, materials and supplies necessary for the maintenance of a
security force.</p>

<p class="BODY">Premises considered<span class="GramE">,</span> the security
guardsâ immediate recourse for the payment of the increases is with their
direct employer, EAGLE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in
order for the security agency to comply with the new wage and allowance rates
it has to pay the security guards, the Wage Orders made specific provision to
amend existing contracts for security services by allowing the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>adjustment of the consideration paid
by the principal to the security agency concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the Wage Orders require, therefore, is
the amendment of the contract as to the consideration to cover the service
contractor's payment of the increases mandated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the end, therefore, ultimate liability for the payment of the
increases rests with the principal.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the security guards should claim the
amount of the increases from EAGLE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under the Labor Code, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>case
the agency fails to pay them the amounts claimed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PTSI should be held <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
liable with EAGLE [Articles 106, 107 and 109.] Should EAGLE pay, it can claim
an adjustment from PTSI for an increase in consideration to cover the increases
payable to the security guards.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in the instant case, the contract for security services
had already expired without being amended consonant with the Wage Orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also apparent from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a reading o</span>f<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span>the record that EAGLE does not now demand from PTSI any
adjustment in the contract price and its main concern is freeing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">itself </span>from liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Given these peculiar circumstances, if PTSI
pays the security guards, it cannot claim reimbursement from EAGLE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But in case it is EAGLE that pays them, the
latter can claim reimbursement from PTSI in lieu of an adjustment, considering
that the contract had expired and had not been renewed.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PTSI also alleges that
it is exempt from payment under the subject Wage Orders because it is a public
sector employer while the Wage Orders cover only employers and employees in the
private sector G.R. No. 81447, Petition, p. 9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 10.] This is unmeritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

upon by PTSI is relevant only for purposes of coverage under the Employees'
Compensation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Labor Code <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">provides </span>that as used in Book Three,

(b), Labor Code.]</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is further contended
by PTSI that to uphold the ruling of the NLRC would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span>

legislations like the Blue Sunday Law [Asia Bed Factory v. National Bed and

different from the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are labor standard legislations enacted
to alleviate the plight of the workers whose wages barely meet the <span class="SpellE">spiralling</span> costs of their basic needs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The increase </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner EAGLE would
moreover ascribe grave abuse of discretion to both the Labor Arbiter and the
NLRC for the inclusion of certain security guards in the complaint.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, EAGLE contends that the names of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Dequina</span> and R.C. <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz should
have been dropped from the complaint as they had already resigned from its
employ and signed a quitclaim in favor of the security agency G.R. No. 81314,
Petition, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">p. </span>6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 7.]</p>

<p class="BODY">However, no grave abuse of discretion can be ascribed to the
labor arbiter for not dropping their names from the complaint it appearing that
the alleged resignation letters are not of record [Labor Arbiter's Decision, p.
6; G. R. No. 81314, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 18.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, EAGLE assails the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> inclusion
of the four (4) security guards whose names were dropped by the labor arbiter
in the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, these four
(4) security guards are part of the ten (10) additional complainants
denominated as "and others" in the complaint and who were identified
in their Manifestation dated <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, they
submitted individual computations in their "Reply to Separate Position
Papers Filed by Respondents".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the Court finds no grave abuse of discretion committed by
the NLRC in granting their appeal.</p>
