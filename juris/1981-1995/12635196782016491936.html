<p class="BODY">This case originated with the filing of a complaint by Ponciano
S. Reyes with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
docketed as Civil Case No. Q-6905, for the annulment of a deed of sale of two
parcels of land with their improvements, executed by his wife, Julia R. De
Reyes as vendor and the spouses <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> V. Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> R. De Mendoza, as vendees. <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
S. Reyes averred that said properties were conjugal properties of himself and
his wife and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">that </span>she had sold them
to petitioners "all by herself" and without his knowledge or consent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> V. Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> R. De Mendoza alleged in their answer that the
properties were <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> properties of Julia R. de
Reyes and that they had purchased the same in good faith and for adequate
consideration. In a separate answer, petitioner Julia R. De <span class="GramE">Reyes,</span>
supported the spouses <span class="SpellE">Mendozas</span>' contentions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dismissed the complaint and declared the properties in
question exclusive and <span class="SpellE">paraphenal</span> properties of
petitioner Julia R. De Reyes. It ruled that she could validly dispose of the
same without the consent of her husband and that the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mendozas</span></st1:place></st1:city> are innocent purchasers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption found in Article 160 of the Civil Code must also
be overcome by one who con­tends that the disputed property is <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>. Article 160 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 160. All property of the marriage is presumed to belong
to the conjugal <span class="GramE">partnership,</span> unless it be proved that
it pertains exclusively to the husband or to the wife."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The presumption is a strong one. As stated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Camia</u></span><u>
de Reyes v. Reyes de <span class="SpellE">Ilano</span></u> (63 Phil. 629, 639),
"it is sufficient to prove that the property was acquired during the
marriage in order that the same may be deemed conjugal property." And in <span class="SpellE"><u>Laluan</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Malpaya</span></u>
(65 SCRA 494, 504) we stated,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>"<span class="GramE">proof</span>
of acquisition of the property in dispute during the marriage suffices to
render the statutory presumption operative."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question chat the disputed property was acquired by
onerous title during the marriage. But were the funds used to buy the lot and
build the improvements at the expense of the common fund?</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the funds came from loans obtained by the
spouses from the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation. Under Article 161 of the
Civil Code, all debts and obligations contracted by the husband and the wife
for the benefit of the conjugal partnership liabilities of the partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in <u>Castillo, Jr. v. Pasco</u> (11 SCRA 102, 107):</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span>
The position thus taken by appellants is meritorious, for the reason that the

Jacinto and by Gabriel and <span class="SpellE">Purificacion</span> Gonzales, to
both spouses Marcelo Castillo and <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span> Pasco, as
joint borrow­ers. The loans thus became obligations of the conjugal partnership
of both debtor spouses and the money loaned is logically conjugal
property."<span style="letter-spacing:1.15pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Citing <span class="SpellE"><u>Palanca</u></span><u> v. Smith Bell
&amp; Co</u>. (9 Phil. 131) interpreting Par. 3, Article 1401 of the old Civil
Code, the Court in <u>Castillo v. Pasco</u> stated:<span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="letter-spacing:1.8pt"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<blockquote>"If money borrowed by the husband alone on the security of his
wife's property is <span class="GramE">conjugal</span> in character, <u>a
fortiori</u> should it be conjugal when borrowed by both spouses. The reason
obviously is that the loan becomes an obligation of the conjugal partnership
which is the one primarily bound for its repayment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To rebut the presumption and the evidence of <span style="letter-spacing:2.2pt">the </span>conjugal character of the property, the
petitioners have only the testimony of Julia de Reyes to offer. </p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Reyes testified that she bought the two parcels of land on
installment basis and that the first payment of a little less than P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> came from her personal funds. The receipt issued by <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, however, shows that the first installment on one
lot was only P69.96 and on the other lot, P102.00. Mrs. Reyes also testified
that she paid the entire purchase price and the construction of the buildings
from her personal funds and money borrowed from the Philippine Bank. The
mortgage contracts, however, show that the properties were paid out of the loan
from RFC.<span class="CharacterStyle2"><span style="letter-spacing:1.85pt"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, Mrs. Reyes' testimony about a loan from Mrs.
Rosa <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, the sale of a lot in <span class="SpellE">Cabiao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> given by her
mother, and the loan from PNB only emphasize the conjugal nature of the
disputed properties because she stated that these sums were also used to put up
their gravel and sand business, a poultry farm, and a banana plantation plus a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> transportation line al­though according to her,
every business venture handled by her husband failed. The two were establishing
businesses and buying properties together as husband and wife, in happier
times.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals ruled upon the testimony of Julia De Reyes
as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the municipal court stated that it had no jurisdiction to decide the <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> or conjugal nature of the properties, the <span class="SpellE">Gocheco</span> brothers filed Civil Case No. 24772 for revival of

by the <span class="SpellE">Mendozas</span> that the said pleading was shown to

<p class="BODY">May the Mendoza spouses be considered buyers in good faith?</p>

<p class="BODY">The proof that the petitioners in L-31618 are purchasers in good
faith comes from the testimony of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Mrs. </span><span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> Mendoza herself. Mrs. Mendoza<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> testified that Mrs. Julia R. De Reyes
assured her that the properties were <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>,
that her lawyer verified the titles being in the name of Mrs. Julia R. De
Reyes, and that she never dealt with Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
Reyes when she and her husband were still renting the properties they later pur­chased.
On cross-examination, Mrs. Mendoza admitted that she learned of the RFC
mortgage when the lots were about to be purchased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Property acquired during
a marriage is presumed to be <span class="GramE">conjugal</span> and the fact
that the land </span>is later registered in the name of only one of the spouses

<p class="BODY">If the fact that property acquired during marriage was registered
in the name of the husband alone does not affect its conjugal nature, neither
does registration in the name of the wife. Any person who buys land registered
in the married name of the wife is put on notice about its conjugal nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mortgage contracts (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
"A-1" and "B-1") executed by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> S. Reyes and Julia Reyes in favor of RFC were duly
registered in the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
and seasonably annotated on transfer certificates of title Nos. 8550 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"F") and 19998 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "G"), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">which </span><span class="GramE">were</span> issued in the name of Julia
Reyes "married to <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> Reyes". Their

1948 and October 11, 1952, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">respectively. </span>On December 10, 1952, the lots
and the building were leased by Julia, with the marital consent of <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to the
petitioners </span><span class="SpellE">Mendozas</span>. The contract of lease
was registered in the Registry of Deeds and was annotated in the transfer
certificates of title<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> on May 5, 1952.
At that time, the RFC mortgages were already noted at the back of the transfer
certificates of title. The petitioners, therefore, unquestionably charged with
notice of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">the exist</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ence and contents
of said mortgages, their joint execution by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
Reyes and Julia Reyes and the application of the loans to the payment to <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> of the purchase price of the lots in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the consent of <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span>
Reyes to the mere lease of the properties was demanded by the <span class="SpellE">Mendozas</span> allegedly for their own protection, yet when it
came to the deed of sale which entailed a greater transfer of rights such
consent was not required.</p>

<p class="BODY">The final argument refers to the alleged unjust enrichment by <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> Reyes if the deed of sale is nullified. The
petitioners admit that the benefit including that represented by one-half of
the purchase price, accrued not to the respondent but to his wife. Since Mr.
Reyes did not receive any part of the proceeds of the sale and his wife <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">has been aligning herself with the Mendoza
couple, there could be no unjust enrichment as alleged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
