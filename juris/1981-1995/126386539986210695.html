				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> which seeks to
annul and set aside:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) the September 1,
1987 resolution<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
of the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R. CV No. <span style="">03198 entitled “Baltazar, Pedro, Ursula and Domingo, </span><span style="">all </span><span style="">surnamed Pantig vs. Venancio Baltazar” granting the private
respondents’ </span>motion for <span style="">new
trial and </span><span style="">b) </span><span style="">the December 1, 1987 resolution of the Court
of Appeals denying the motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case as found by <span style="">the </span>Court of Appeals, are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">During his lifetime, Macario Baltazar, divided his properties by
way of inheritance, among his children and his grandchildren, the surviving
heirs <span style="">of his </span>deceased daughter
Anastacia Baltazar who died <span style="">in </span>1952,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BaItazar, Pedro, Ursula and
Domingo, all <span style="">surnamed Pantig.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave the properties known </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">Banga, Pagpito and Sukol, named after the sitios where the properties
were situated; that because the grandchildren were still minors, the properties
adjudicated to them known as Lot No. 1471 of the Sexmoan Cadastre, with an area
of 139,126 square meters were placed under the joint </span>management/administration
of Venancio Baltazar and Ma<span style="">x</span>ima
Baltazar and her husband, Justo Garcia (Rollo, <span style="">p.</span> 6<span style="">6).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>1924, upon
agreement of Maxima and Venancio, Lot No. 1471 was converted into a fishpond
and said <span style="">land w</span><span style="">as </span><span style="">covered by Tax Declaration No. 6081 in the </span>name of Macario
Baltazar (Rollo, <u><span style="">Ibid</span></u><span style="">.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When Pedro Pantig, son of the deceased Anastacia Baltazar, became
of age, he and his brothers and sisters demanded from their uncle, Venancio
Baltazar, the return of their properties to them, but their uncle merely told
them not to worry and instead gave them P200.00 semi-annually as their shares
in the produce <span style="">of t</span>he fishpond;
their last share of P400.00 was received <span style="">in
1969 (Rollo, </span><u><span style="">Ibid</span></u><span style="">.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 23, 1968, applicant Venancio Baltazar filed in Court <span style="">an </span>application for registration of
three parcels of land, designated as Lots Nos. 1471, 1747 and <span style="">1801 of the Sexmoan Cadastre, with an area of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">139,296
square meters, 20,592 square meters and 3,178 square meters, respectively, all
situated </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">Barangay San Antonio and Sta. Monica,
Pampanga (</span><span style="">Rollo, </span><span style="">Decision, p. 18).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the said application f<span style="">or registration, the </span>applicant alleged
that he acquired Lot No. 1747 and Lot <span style="">No.
1801 from Jose L. Lacsamana on December 7, 1953 and Lot No. 1471, partly by
inheritance from his late father Macario Baltazar </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">died in 1925 and that his possession thereof, together with that of his
predecessor-in-interest, has been open, peaceful, public, continuous and
adverse and in the concept of owner for more than thirty years (Rollo, </span><u><span style="">Ibid.</span></u><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The late Hon. Malcolm G. Sarmiento, then Presiding Judge of this
Branch (CFI), appointed the Branch Clerk of Court Irene T. Galura (now retired)
as Commissioner <span style="">to receive the evidence
for </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">applicant </span><span style="">and the applicant presented three (3) witnesses before the Commissioner
and thereafter submitted the application for decision (Rollo, <u>Ibid</u>.</span><span style="">).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">a </span>decision
rendered on August 29, 1969, the <span style="">court
confirmed the applicant’s title to the three </span><span style="">par</span>c<span style="">els of </span><span style="">land described in the application, including
the lot in question (Lot 1471) and ordered that the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">be decreed in </span><span style="">favor </span><span style="">of Venancio Baltazar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="3"><span style="">March 6, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">, an order for the issuance of </span>the <span style="">corresponding decree was issued </span>(Rollo,
<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 20, 1970, petitioners Pantig filed a petition for review
of judgment in the Regional Trial <span style="">Court,
Branch XLI, San Fernando, Pampanga, insofar as</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Lot 1471 </span>is
concerned, alleging that the same <span style="">is </span>their
property and that Venancio Baltazar has defrauded <span style="">them by intentionally omitting them in his application for registration
</span>of <span style="">the land and by stating in
the application that the said land belongs to him, notwithstanding his full
knowledge that </span>the same <span style="">lawfully
</span>belongs to the herein petitioners, despite the <span style="">fact that Venancio Baltazar was merely holding the property in trust </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">an uncle administrator of the </span>property (Rollo, <u>Ibid</u>., p.
18).</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the petition <span style="">for
</span>review, the same court, in its order of June 24, 1970, ordered the Land<span style=""> Registration Commissioner to hold in abeyance
the is</span>suance of a decree over Lot No. 1471 (Rollo, <u>Ibid</u>., p. 19)
but on December 15, 1972, dismissed the <span style="">petition
for review without prejudice on the part of petitioner to file an ordinary
action for reconveyance </span>(Rollo, <u><span style="">Ibid</span></u><span style="">.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 25, <span style="">1973, </span>petitioners
elevated the<span style=""> dismissal of their
petition to the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals) which
remanded the case to the court of origin, which was ordered </span>to <span style="">act on the petition for review in </span>accordance
with the <span style="">law </span><span style="">and the evidence, as presented in support of
the petition as well as that presented in opposition thereto </span><span style="">(Rollo, </span><span style="">Annex “D”, p. 30).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1984</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered in favor of the petitioners Pantig, the dispositive
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>‘3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon the finality of this decision,
respondent Venancio Baltazar is hereby ordered to surrender possession of Lot
1471 to the petitioners and to render within sixty (60) days thereof an

<blockquote>“With costs against applicant-respondent Venancio <span style="">Baltazar.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Intermediate Appellate Court (now <span style="">Court of Appeals), on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="3"><span style="">March 21,
 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, affirmed the </span><span style="">decision of the lower court, the dispositive

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE finding no reversible error <span style="">in the </span>judgment appealed from, the same is hereby AFFIRMED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1986</st1:date>,
the respondent filed a motion <span style="">for </span><span style="">reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="4"><span style="">April 16, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent filed a Supplemental Motion for </span><span style="">New </span><span style="">Trial under Section 9 o</span><span style="">f </span><span style="">Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 based on the
following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THAT NEWLY DISCOVERED EVIDENCES HAVE BEEN FOUND WHICH IF PRESENTED
WOULD PROBABLY ALTER THE DECISION IN THE INSTANT CASE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(ROLLO, P. 134).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had filed their respective pleadings and their
oral arguments heard, the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals)
promulgated a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="9">September
 1, 1987</st1:date>, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in the interest of justice, the motion for new trial is
hereby GRANTED to give an opportunity <span style="">for
</span>the movants to adduce their newly discovered evidences.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Let the records of this case be remanded to the trial court for
appropriate proceedings.” (Rollo, Annex “A”, p. 3).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To said resolutions, the petitioners filed a <span style="">motion </span>for reconsideration, <span style="">which </span>was denied by the Court of
Appeals in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="12">December
 1, 1987</st1:date> (Rollo, Annex “B”, pp. 58-59).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>Hence, the petition.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Second Division of <span style="">this
Court, in </span>its <span style="">resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="2"><span style="">February
 15, 1989</span></st1:date><span style=""> gave due
course to the petition and required both parties to file their </span>simultaneous
memoranda (Rollo, Petition, pp. 8-16; Resolution, p. 145).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Memorandum for petitioners (pp. 121-128) was filed <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1989</st1:date> while private respondent’s memorandum was
filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1989</st1:date>
(Rollo, pp. 129-146).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue in <span style="">this </span>case
is whether or <span style="">not </span>the private
respondent is entitled to a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of Rule 37 of the New Rules of Court enumerates the
grounds <span style="">for </span>new trial, among
others:</p>

<blockquote>“a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Newly discovered evidence, which he could
not, with reasonable diligence, <span style="">have </span>discovered,
and produced at the trial, and which if presented would probably <span style="">alter </span>the result.<span style="" times="" new="" roman=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>“c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x.”<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for new trial upon the ground of newly discovered
evidence, is properly granted where there is concurrence of the following
requisites, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) the evidence had
been discovered after trial; b) the evidence could <span style="">not </span>have been discovered and produced <span style="">during trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence; and c) the
evidence is material, and not merely corroborative, cumulative, or impeaching
and is of </span>such weight <span style="">that if
admitted, would probably alter the result (Tumang v. Court of Appeals, 172 SCRA
332 [1989]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In order that a particular piece of evidence may be properly
regarded as “newly discovered” for purposes of a grant of a new trial, what is
essential is not <span style="">so </span><span style="">much the time when the evidence offered </span><span style="">first </span><span style="">sprang into existence nor the time when it first came to the knowledge
of the party now submitting it; what is essential is, rather, that the offering
party had exercised reasonable diligence in seeking to locate such evidence
before or during trial but had nonetheless failed to secure it </span><span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the fact that the deed of sale, the contracts
of lease mortgage and the like, are allegedly newly discovered, are not supported
by the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they
could have been produced during the trial in the lower court, any time from
July 1970 up to April 4, 1984, inasmuch as they are known by Venancio Baltazar
and his heirs <span style="">or </span>his <span style="">counsel and are easily obtainable from the
parties </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the contract, from the notary </span><span style="">public </span><span style="">who notarized them or from the clerk of court where copies are
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">S</span>a<span style="">i</span>d documents
cannot, therefore, be considered as considered <span style="">as </span>newly discovered evidence but more <span style="">correctly ascribed as suppressed evidence.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonethele<span style="">ss,</span> aft<span style="">e</span>r a <span style="">c</span>ar<span style="">e</span>f<span style="">ul </span>study of the findings of the trial
court (Decision, pp. 18-27) which were <span style="">support</span>ed
<span style="">by substantial evidence and unanimously
affirmed by the Court of Appeals (Rollo, Decision, pp.</span><span style=""> 28-36)</span>, there appears no basis <span style="">for </span>the claim that the alleged newly
discovered evidence would alter the result of the said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES</b> <b>CONSIDERED</b>, the petition is hereby
GRANTED, the assailed resolutions dated September 1, 1987 and December 1, 1987
are hereby SET ASIDE, and the the decision of the Court of Appeals dated March
21, 1986 is hereby REINSTATED.</p>
