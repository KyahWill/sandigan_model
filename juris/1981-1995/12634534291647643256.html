				<BR><STRONG>RELOVA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Complaint dated April 25, 1967, for sum of money, more specifically, the sum 
of Forty-five Thousand Six Hundred Four Pesos and Seventy-six centavos (P45 
,604.76), which is the alleged balance owing from defendant-appellant to 
plaintiff- appellee.&nbsp; It was docketed as Civil Case No. 69548 before Branch XII 
of the Court of First Instance of Manila. 
<p>Summons and complaint were served on defendant-corporation, thru Aquilina 
Situbal, a house girl of Mr. Victor Nepomuceno, the General Manager of 
defendant-corporation. </p>
<p>Defendant-corporation, thru counsel Atty. Paulino Al. Aquino and by way of 
special appearance, filed on August 4, 1967 a Motion to Dismiss on ground of 
improper service of summons.&nbsp; Plaintiff filed its opposition to dismiss. </p>
<p>The lower court in its order dated August 5, 1967 did not dismiss the case; 
instead, it ordered "that a new summons be issued to be served in accordance 
with the provisions of Section 13, Rule 14 of the Revised Rules of Court x x x 
to be complied within a period of fifteen days from today, (or) otherwise this 
case would be dismissed." </p>
<p>As no valid summons was served within the period of fifteen (15) days as 
required in the order of August 5, 1967, defendant-corporation, through Atty. 
Paulino Al. Aquino, filed another Motion to Dismiss. &nbsp;This was opposed by 
plaintiff, alleging that summons was served on defendant-corporation on August 
17, 1967 thru "Mr. Rodolfo Marigmen, Purchasing Chief of Stock of defendant 
corporation." </p>
<p>Arguing that the second service of summons was also improper, 
defendant-corporation, thru counsel Atty. Paulino Al. Aquino and likewise by way 
of special appearance, filed a Supplemental Motion to Dismiss dated September 4, 
1967.&nbsp; On the other hand, plaintiff filed an ex- parte motion to declare 
defendant in default. </p>
<p>During the hearing of the two motions on September 23, 1967, 
defendant-corporation submitted an affidavit of Rodolfo Marigmen who stated that 
he was just a minor employee therein.&nbsp; Whereupon, the court denied plaintiff's 
motion to declare defendant in default.&nbsp; In the meantime, the lower court failed 
to resolve defendant's motion to dismiss dated September 4, 1967 on the ground 
of improper service of summons. </p>
<p>On December 28, 1967, defendant-corporation, thru same counsel, filed another 
Motion to Dismiss, similar to its unresolved motion dated September 4, 1967.&nbsp; 
Plaintiff opposed the motion and, on January 5, 1968, filed a motion to allow 
plaintiff to serve summons by publication. </p>
<p>The lower court, in an order dated January 6, 1968, directed 
defendant-corporation's counsel, Atty. Paulino Al. Aquino "to inform the court 
within five (5) days from today the whereabouts of the officers of the 
defendant-corporation so that proper service of summons may be made on them." 
</p>
<p>On January 9, 1968, Atty. Aquino filed his compliance, giving the names and 
addresses of the Officers and Directors of defendant-corporation.&nbsp; This was 
followed by an urgent motion and manifestation, dated February 8, 1968, filed by 
plaintiff praying that the secretary of defendant-corporation be ordered to 
appear before the lower court "to receive the summons." </p>
<p>On February 17, 1968, the court ordered "that summons be issued and served 
through the lawyers of the defendant-corporation, Messrs. Syquia and 
Associates." Pursuant to this order, plaintiff obtained an alias summons and 
with the assistance of Special Sheriff Enrique Escriba, served the summons and 
complaint on defendant-corporation, through its counsel Atty. Paulino Al. 
Aquino, an Assistant Attorney in the Syquia Law Offices. </p>
<p>Plaintiff, on May 30, 1968, filed a Motion to declare defendant in default 
and to allow plaintiff to present its evidence ex- parte.&nbsp; The lower court, in 
its order dated June 1, 1968, granted the same. </p>
<p>Plaintiff presented its evidence ex- parte before the Branch Clerk of Court 
who was appointed commissioner to receive the evidence.&nbsp; Thereafter, the court 
rendered a decision "sentencing the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum of 
P45 ,604.71 with interest thereon at the stipulated rate of 12% per annum from 
the time of the filing of this case until the full amount is paid; plus 
P1,000.00 as reasonable attorney's fees, it appearing that the defendant failed 
to satisfy plaintiff's plainly valid demands plus the costs." </p>
<p>The only issue in this appeal is whether or not the court acquired 
jurisdiction over the person of the defendant-private corporation when the 
summons and copy of the complaint were served on its retained counsel. </p>
<p>It is the position of herein defendant-appellant that the lower court did not 
acquire jurisdiction over it due to improper service of summons and, therefore, 
there was an error in declaring the latter in default and rendering judgment 
against it instead of dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction. </p>
<p>WE are not persuaded.&nbsp; Section 13, Rule 14 of the New Rules of Court, 
provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 13.&nbsp; Service upon private domestic corporation or partnership.&nbsp; - If 
the defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of the Philippines or a 
partnership duly registered, service may be made on the president, manager, 
secretary, cashier, agent, or any of its directors." </p></blockquote>
<p>It is admitted that in this case the summons and copy of the complaint were 
served upon Atty. Paulino Al. Aquino, an Assistant Attorney in the Syquia Law 
Offices and who, in three or four instances, had already appeared in court in 
connection with the Motions to Dismiss on the ground of improper service of 
summons.&nbsp; Section 13, Rule 14 of the Revised Rules of Court, provides that 
service of summons upon a domestic corporation may be made on its agent.&nbsp; In the 
case at bar, where defendant-corporation's counsel received the summons, he was 
acting for and in behalf of the defendant in connection with the Motions to 
Dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the person of the defendant due 
to improper service of summons.&nbsp; Perforce, he was the defendant's agent and 
under the aforecited rule, service upon him is sufficient. </p>
<p>In the case of Republic vs. Ker and Co., Ltd. 18 SCRA 207 (213), the 
defendant argued that the Court a quo did not acquire jurisdiction over its 
person inasmuch as summons was not served upon it but upon Messrs. Leido and 
Associates who do not come under any of the class of persons upon whom summons 
should be served as enumerated in Section 13, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; 
This Court held that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Messrs. Leido and Associates acted as counsel for Ker &amp; Co., Ltd. when 
this tax case was in its administrative stage.&nbsp; The same counsel represented Ker 
&amp; Co., Ltd., when it appealed said case to the Court of Tax Appeals and 
later to this Court.&nbsp; Subsequently, when the Deputy Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue, by letter dated March 15, 1962, demanded the payment of deficiency 
income tax in question, it was Messrs. Leido, Andrada, Perez &amp; Associates 
who replied in behalf of Ker &amp; Co., Ltd. in two letters, dated March 28, 
1962 and April 10, 1962, both after the complaint in this case was filed.&nbsp; At 
least therefore on April 2, 1962 when Messrs. Leido and Associates received the 
summons, they were still acting for and in behalf of Ker &amp; Co., Ltd. in 
connection with its tax liability involved in this case.&nbsp; Perforce, they were 
the taxpayer's agent when summons was served.&nbsp; Under Section 13 of Rule 7 (now 
Rule 14), aforequoted, service upon the agent of a corporation is sufficient." 
(Republic vs. Ker &amp; Co., Ltd., 18 SCRA 213) </p></blockquote>
<p>In line with the ruling of this Court in the aforementioned case, WE hold 
that there was valid service of summons in this case. </p>
<p><strong>ACCORDINGLY</strong>, the lower court's order dated June 1, 1966 
declaring defendant-corporation in default is upheld, and the prayer that the 
decision dated June 27, 1968 be set aside is hereby DENIED. </p>
<p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>Teehankee</em><em>, (Chairman), Makasiar, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, 
Vasquez, </em>and<em> Gutierrez, Jr., JJ.,</em>concur. </p></div>
