				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of
Appeals<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">*</span></span></a> of November 7, 1985, affirming the Order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">**</span></span></a> dated December 17, 19 79 of the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo. The facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The land in question is designated as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1, Psu-99817 originally covered by OCT No. 0-4 of the Registry of Deeds of
Iloilo in the name of Mariano R. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>. It comprises
14,240,768 sq. meters. It is now covered-by TCT No. T-71508 in the name of
Calagna-an Agro-Industrial Corporation - a family corporation of the late
Marinao R. Lacson.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforementioned OCT No. 0-4 was obtained by the late Mariano
R. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> pursuant to the judgment in Land
Registration Case No. 567 dated December 3, 1940.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 28, 1975, the Republic of the Philippines filed with
the Court of First Instance of Iloilo a complaint against the heirs of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Calagna</span>-an Agro-Industrial
Corporation, and the Register of Deeds of Iloilo (Civil Case No. 10439) to
nullify the decision of said court in Land Registration Case No. 567 dated
December 3, 1940; to annul OCT No. 0-4 issued to the late Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> pursuant to said judgment as well as the subsequent
transfer certificate of title in the name of defendant corporation and to
declare the reversion of the land in question and the improvements thereon to
the State. The Republic alleged among other things, that the land involved is
almost entirely timber-land and, as such the land registration court did not
acquire jurisdiction over the land; that the decision of December 3, 1940 had
been appealed to the Court of Appeals (the last World War broke out and the
records were destroyed) by the Director of Lands and Forestry; that the trial
court could not have validly issued an order directing the issuance of a decree
over the land in the absence of any reconstitution of the lost or destroyed
pleadings of LRC No. 567.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 16, 1978, the lower court rendered a decision dismissing
the Republic's complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic filed a motion for reconsideration and on December
17, 1979, the lower court issued an order setting aside the June 16, 1978
decision, the dispositive portion of the December 17, 1979 Order reading:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered setting aside the decision
dated June 16, 1978 and rendering decision in its stead:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1) declaring the plaintiff the owner of the portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1, Psu-99817, with an area of 971.65 hectares indicated on the map (Exhibit M),
the portion being timberland and, therefore, <span class="SpellE">undisposable</span>
land of the public domain;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) declaring null and void <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">ab</i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> <span class="SpellE">initio</span></i>
Original Certificate of Title No. 0-4 and Transfer Certificate of Title No.
T-71508 (Exhibit Q) as regards the said portion of 971.65 hectares;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) ordering the defendant, Register of Deeds of Iloilo, to cancel
Original Certificate of Title No. 0-4 and Transfer Certificate of Title No.
T-71508;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4) declaring the defendants possessors in bad faith of the portion
under litigation and not entitled to reimbursement of any and all improvements
they may have introduced; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>5) ordering the defendants, heirs of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Calagna</span>-an Agro-Industrial Corporation, to vacate
the portion under litigation and to deliver to the plaintiff the possession of
the said portion and all improvements thereon, without pronouncement as to
costs.” (pp. 75-76, <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rollo</i></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After denial of the motion for reconsideration, the petitioner
appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the Order in its decision of
November 7, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that respondent court erred:</p>

<blockquote>“a) In implicitly holding that the <st1:street><st1:address>Land
  Registration Court</st1:address></st1:street> has no jurisdiction in Land
Reg. Case No. 567 (Mariano R. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, applicant);</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) In not dismissing the reversion suit (Civil Case No. 10439)
since there was an appeal in the registration proceedings, and the judgment
therein has not been annulled;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) In holding that petitioners should have reconstituted the
records of Land Reg. Case No. 567, instead of placing the burden upon the
State; and<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">d) In not
holding that the State cannot 'ventilate anew the factual and legal issues
affecting the disposability of subject land after the same had been placed by
them in Land Registration Case No. 567' (pp. 81-82, <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rollo</i></span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the respondents when they said that:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The Court of First Instance of Iloilo did not acquire
jurisdiction over the land in question, the same being timberland.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The appeal of the government to Court of Appeals in the land
registration proceedings did not bar the institution of the cancellation suit
against the petitioners. The issuance of a decree over the land in dispute in
1946 and the corresponding certificate of title in 1947 rendered such an appeal
impractical, necessitating therefor a remedy other than the said appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Petitioners had the burden to reconstitute the records of the
land registration proceedings for after all they were the ones interested in
preserving their alleged right to the disputed land.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. The land registration proceedings does not constitute <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><u>res</u></i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u></i>.
Two of the essential requisites namely, that the former judgment must be final
and it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction of the subject
matter and parties are absent in this case. Be it noted that properties of the
public domain can never be the subject of land registration proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, this
petition is DISMISSED and the assailed decision is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
