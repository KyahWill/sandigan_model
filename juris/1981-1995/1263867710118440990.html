finding them guilty beyond reasonable doubt for the murder of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The above conviction was based principally on the testimony of an
alleged eyewitness, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span>, the testimony of
Dr. Jose Velasquez, and an alleged ante-mortem statement of the late Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case disclose that on August 3, 1986, the
victim was at the MGR Family Disco and Restaurant (MGR, for brevity), at <span class="SpellE">Surallah</span>, South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
celebrating his birthday over beer and refreshments with about fourteen nephews
and nieces,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
whereupon the two accused-appellants arrived, one after the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Joseph <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>
arrived at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="12">12:30</st1:time> or <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1986</st1:date>, and about ten minutes
later, Alex <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> appeared.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
It seems that the two had been old acquaintances who, up to then, had not seen
each other <span class="GramE">for</span> six months.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The two apparently exchanged pleasantries, shook hands, but separated
immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>
sat at a table where he met certain women with one of whom he danced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Biare</span> meanwhile sat
alone on another table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> also sat alone subsequently on a table away from
the women.</p>

<p class="BODY">The victim then approached <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>,
squeezed his mouth, and uttered challenging words:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Are you not afraid of the <span class="SpellE">Sisons</span>?"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="GramE">(In apparent reference to the <span class="SpellE">Sisons</span> of </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE">, a family with a long history of local and national political
authority and clout.)</span> He parried the victim's hand and alleged that he
saw a knife shining amidst blinking disco lights.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
He likewise alleged that the victim began lunging away at him with his knife,
which he was able to parry with his left hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span>, who was with the victim,
struck him (<span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>) on the left cheek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (<span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>) said
that he also suffered a cut at the left wrist.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The two later fought for possession of the knife but the victim managed to
punch him and so did a certain "<span class="SpellE">Neckneck</span>" <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He was later ganged upon, so he alleges, for which he suffered bruises.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was then a picture of pandemonium as men brawled and bottles
flew.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Biare</span>, all the while, remained seated.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the dust settled and the lights went on, <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>
lay crawling on the disco floor, bloodied and his head bowed.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>, <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>
had his hands raised in surrender.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Please help me, have mercy on me,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
he allegedly pleaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (<span class="SpellE">Biare</span>) allegedly offered to bring him to a hospital, but
the latter allegedly said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"No,
because the place is the area where the <span class="SpellE">Sisons</span> are,
we might be seen there.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

He later helped him on his (<span class="SpellE">Biare's</span>) motorcycle and
brought him home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also testified that
he also went right on home.</p>

<p class="BODY">What turned out, however, is that while <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>
nursed his injuries, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> had also in fact
been wounded, as a result also of a knifing, although both <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> denied harming him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Biare</span> claimed that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">three o'clock</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1986</st1:date>, a certain <span class="SpellE">Pepe</span> <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, apparently Lorenzo's relative, along with eight
armed men, saw him at his house and asked who stabbed Lorenzo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the first time, he said, that he
learned that the latter had in fact been injured too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six
 o'clock</st1:time> later, he saw him at the municipal hall, according to him,
to talk things over.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> supposedly saw Dr. Rolando
Arroyo that morning, who found the following injuries on his body:</p>

Fiscal Isaac Moran of the Provincial <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office

murder, qualified by treachery and evident premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The star witness for the prosecution, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span>,
testified that he was involved in that brawl early in the morning of <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1986</st1:date> at the MGR in <span class="SpellE">Surallah</span>, and that he was one of those who ganged up on <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
likewise testified that as he beat up <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>, the
latter slipped out a knife and so did <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly retreated, whereupon, saw <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> bury his knife on <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, the two left together on a motorcycle, and Alex was heard
to shout:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Diputa</span>

["(Expletives deleted), we will see each other tomorrow."]</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Velasquez, testifying for the people, added that the victim
had been stabbed by two different instruments, belonging to two different

<p class="BODY">The prosecution having rested, the defense adduced its
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense presented <span class="SpellE">Miraluna</span> Flores, a waitress at MGR, who testified that the
two accused did not enter the premises together, <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>
preceding <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> by ten minutes, and that they did
not share the same table. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>She declared
that <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> was accosted by one of the <span class="SpellE">Sisons</span> and a commotion soon ensued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Biare</span> allegedly
remained seated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the lights went
on, <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> lay on the floor, "filled with
blood."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> helped him up and the two fled.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gemma</span> <span class="SpellE">Labtic</span>
corroborated <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>, insofar as she saw <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> lying on the floor when the smoke cleared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that she saw men arrived with
knives, <span class="GramE">who</span>, however, scampered away when the lights
went on.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted at the outset, the trial court convicted both accused of
murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the court:</p>

<blockquote>The findings of facts stated in the Order granting the cancellation
of bail bond of accused Joseph <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> afore-quoted
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strength of the evidence of
the prosecution remained undiminished even with the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Miraluna</span> Flores and of accused <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears natural for accused Joseph <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> to beckon his co-accused, Alex <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>,
upon the latter's arrival for they had not seen each other the past six
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to merely shake hands then
part ways with Alex going to a vacant table leaving his friend co-accused alone
and refusing to drink beer together is unnatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It attempts to establish no conspiracy
between them took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
discredited for the only purpose shown by the two accused was that they were
not companions or were not together that evening particularly during that
commotion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For friends to meet after <span class="GramE">six-months</span> absence means a lot for togetherness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was why <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>
beckoned Alex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it could not be true
that Alex told <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> he was looking for somebody as
Alex did not go all over the place but stopped and danced with a woman then
seated alone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the accused <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> kept sitting on
his chair while all customers of MGR stood up during the commotion is also
unnatural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Self-preservation could have
moved him to stand to be ready to evade if the protagonist may reach his place,
or to defend himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would one permit
his friend molested without raising a voice of protest?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> only stood up when the lights were
on and he saw his friend Alex <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> crawling is
not believable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To rescue Alex at the
time that his alleged malefactors were still present and for them to leave
after <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> shouted that was enough and have mercy on
him is also doubtful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The malefactors
could vent their anger to (sic) <span class="GramE">him,</span> otherwise the
malefactors were afraid of <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And for what?</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Biare</span> was armed
said <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span> who backtracked after boxing Alex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, what made Tony <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span>
to leave the place of Alex was <span class="SpellE">Biare's</span> presence where
he was holding a knife just beside Alex.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span> that he boxed
Alex is confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> escorted
Alex after the incident, then both accused rode on a motorcycle is likewise
confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not rebutted is the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span> that
Alex shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Diputa</span>
<span class="SpellE">kamo</span>, <span class="SpellE">lenti</span> <span class="SpellE">kamo</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">magkita</span></span>-ay
<span class="SpellE">kita</span> <span class="SpellE">buas</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Biare's</span> presence with a knife was to
ascertain that no one of the several companions of the victim who celebrated
his birthday could render succor or save him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was to make certain the killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Bringing Alex out to safety made certain <span class="SpellE">Biare's</span>
<span class="SpellE">conspirational</span> acts with Alex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of one is the act of another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both are liable as principals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It taxes one's mind to understand why the victim would carry a
knife and threaten Alex by:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) squeezing
Alex's mouth; 2) swinging his right hand towards Alex; 3) stabbing Alex who was
able to hold the hand of the victim holding the knife; 4) the grappling and
wrestling with Alex when it was the birthday of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During one's birthday one is engrossed with
his friends and no doubt did never think or prepare for any trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim was surprised with the sudden
attack of Alex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim and his
friends were unnerved with the knife used by Alex and the presence of <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> holding a knife nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim pointed to both accused to have
stabbed him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Not credible is Alex (sic) self defense
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had no arm (sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was ganged up by the victim with a knife <span class="GramE">who</span> stabbed him and was hit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is denied by his medical certificate and the doctor's testimony
that he did not submit for treatment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the victim over him and the victim's companions with knives, could
Alex escape with his life; would Alex be not seriously injured?</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition, Alex said he had no quarrel with the victim; so with <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> who said he had no quarrel with the victim before
that fatal night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both said they had no
quarrel with Antonio <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why would the victim in his statements given
to the police and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span> implicate both of
them as the authors of the offense?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since no motive is shown, the Court finds <span class="SpellE">Llaneta's</span>
testimony credible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At a distance of three meters, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span>
saw the victim was stabbed while the victim was passing by the accused Alex
whom <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span> boxed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But he could do no more as <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> was raising
his knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Biare</span>
was only 1-1/2 meters away from <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span> who then
back-tracked (pp. 26, 27, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="7">July
 27, 1987</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When one passes
by another in public places one is not aware to put up a defense as one does
not entertain any thought that he would be attacked by those he passes by at
places like MGR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This situation
qualifies the crime to murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery
in the attack of the victim was present.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court is not inclined to believe that Alex lost consciousness
then <span class="GramE">crawled,</span> bathed with blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alex said his father washed his face and
eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not say he undressed his
bloody pants or his arms or his body waist up being bloodied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alex was not really hurt as is made to appear
by <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
an <span class="SpellE">eyemo</span> was used to treat him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He submitted to the doctor only for
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For treatment, no Alex
refused to be brought to a hospital as his injury was slight so he should be
only brought home, said <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then why would <span class="SpellE">Biare's</span>
story be believed that he shouted to have mercy on Alex?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And why did he not see the victim with the
stab wounds or with blood?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds, based on the evidence, that the trial judge erred,
and, therefore, his judgment must accordingly be modified.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court also finds the trial judge's conclusions, especially as
to the relationship between the two accused, the factor of conspiracy, and the
circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation, to be plainly,
conjectures and speculations, and they can not satisfy the legal requisite of
proof beyond reasonable doubt to justify a conviction for an offense, in this
case, murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court is indeed,
genuinely distressed, and has every reason to be so, because His Honor could
not have, by any stretch of logic made out, by simply piecing the evidence
together, his findings that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the two
accused-appellants went to MGR on August 3, 1986 in a well-planned conspiracy
to eliminate the deceased; (2) they pretended that they had just met there by
chance, but had all along plotted to kill the victim; (3) the
accused-appellant, Joseph <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>, deliberately
positioned himself so that "no one of the several companions of the victim
who celebrated his birthday could render succor or save him,"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
(4) the deceased could not have threatened the accused, Alex <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>, or accost him challengingly, because "[d]<span class="SpellE">uring</span> one's birthday, one is engrossed with his friends and
no doubt did never [sic] think or prepare for any trouble;"<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
and that (5) <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> could not have been the victim
of a mauling because "he did not submit [himself] for treatment."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court is at a loss because none of these inferences are apparent from the
evidence, the <span class="GramE">prosecutionâ€™s</span> or the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is apparent, on the other hand, is that
judging from His Honor's self-righteous outburst, as it were, His Honor had his
own subplot on the events, when as <span class="GramE">magistrate,</span> his
sole and paramount concern was to try facts and apply the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> story that they had
actually met by happenstance at the MGR on the night in question not only
stands <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> in the records, this Court
finds it, contrary to the opinion of the trial judge, not to be per se an
implausible or impeachable story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
is more, it can not be justifiably and validly contended that because the two,
after bumping into each other did not act like long-lost friends, it means that
they had met previously, of all things, in order to plot the killing of Lorenzo
<span class="SpellE">Sison</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
sheer inference that <span class="GramE">itself</span> rests on an
inference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge portrays the accused-appellants' "chance
meeting" as an effort "to establish no conspiracy between them took
place."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
What he, the trial judge, loses sight of is the fact that the accused were not
called upon to discredit the prosecution's theory of conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the prosecution's duty to establish
the existence of what the prosecution alleged to be conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge also expresses doubts whether or not the accused,
Joseph <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>, indeed just minded his own business
while the <span class="SpellE">Sisons</span> ganged up on his co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Would one permit his friend
molested," he inquired, "without raising a voice of protest?"<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
His rich imagination is fascinating, but that hardly belongs to a judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Biare</span> averred,
he did come to the aid of his co-accused, although after the damage had been
done and the latter lay battered on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the judge would make out, however, from the defense's version is
that either <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> or <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>
merely contrived the whole yarn, and that the melee never occurred at all
(because as he states, if there indeed was one, <span class="SpellE">Biare</span>
would have allegedly stood up for a friend in distress).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the very testimony of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span>, witness for the prosecution, is arrayed against
him, the latter having admitted "that he boxed [sic] Alex [<span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>]."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

and the fact that both accused left together can not be accepted by the Court
as a piece of evidence of conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
has been held that conspiracy, like the offense itself, must be shown to exist
beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>

Hence, the fact that the two accused may have happened to leave together, and
one of them left a closing warning, can not instantly support a finding of
conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution is, in
addition, hard put to adduce evidence demonstrating facts that the parties had <span class="SpellE">priorly</span> come to an agreement to commit the crime with which
they are charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the act of
agreeing need not be demonstrated, evidence of the fact of agreement must
nonetheless be convincingly shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> acts after the fact, by themselves, are
inadequate to show that previous agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court is "taxed" how the victim, as the
defense alleged, could have squeezed Alex <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> by
the mouth, taken a swing at him, and armed himself with a knife--when it was
supposedly his birthday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court is taxed
not only with the trial court's improper and <span class="SpellE">unjudicial</span>
recourse to non sequiturs, but because it is in such celebrations that trouble
is in fact commonplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Llaneta</span>, as we earlier indicated, admitted having thrown
punches at <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> did not check
into a hospital in view of his injuries can not erase the other fact that he
did sustain injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Rolando <span class="SpellE">Arrojo's</span> testimony, a testimony that has not been to this
day rebutted, illustrated that, among other wounds, <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>
suffered an "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]<span class="SpellE">ncised</span>
wound, gaping, with both edges sharp, 2.5 <span class="SpellE">cms</span>. <span class="GramE">in</span> length, superficial, located at the left forearm, lower
third, back portion."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
It was a wound that did not obviously require hospitalization, for which <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> did not precisely ask for one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>'
omission did not eliminate all possibility that he (<span class="SpellE">Padrones</span>)
too was a victim of a mauling and had suffered injuries <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the trial judge has shown no rational basis why he
should reject the defense's story completely and accept that of the prosecution
unquestioningly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tragedy here is
that two men, both in their early twenties, are facing long jail terms because
the trial judge had his own theory about the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes with legitimate concern the conviction in
question that has indeed been made to stand on the infirmity of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;

win its case on the strength of its evidence and not on the weakness of that of
the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>
