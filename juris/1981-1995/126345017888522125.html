of Appeals' Resolution, dated November 11, 1967, denying petitioner's Motion to
Set Aside Entry of Judgment in CA-G.R. No. 27311-R.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the records before us, we gather that respondent J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., a domestic corporation organized
and existing under the laws of the Philippines (hereinafter simply called
Corporation), is the registered owner of a parcel of land known as the Sta.
Mesa Heights Subdivision, situated in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 1267 (37686-Rizal) issued in its
name by the Registry of Deeds of said City.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Title over the said tract of land was originally registered under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
system as far back as <st1:date year="1914" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1914</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1959</st1:date>,
the Corporation instituted an action for recovery of possession against
petitioner in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
docketed as Civil Case No. Q-3697.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
alleged that on <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1957</st1:date>,
petitioner, through force, strategy and stealth, and without its consent,
entered into, occupied and subsequently constructed his house on a
200-square-meter-portion of the land at Barrio North, <span class="SpellE">Tatalon</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>,
covered by the title of the Corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in his Answer, claimed that he bought the land on <st1:date year="1956" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1956</st1:date> from <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> Campos, whose title thereto could be traced back
to <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, the
first known "owner" of the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1959" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1959</st1:date>,
the trial Court rendered judgment ordering petitioner or any person claiming
under him, to remove his house and other constructions from the property in
question; to surrender possession thereof to the Corporation; to pay P20.00 a
month from <st1:date year="1957" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1957</st1:date>
until possession is restored; and to pay the costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 27311-R).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="5">May
 11, 1967</st1:date>, that Court affirmed the Decision of the trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner received a copy of the same on <st1:date year="1967" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through counsel, he filed a Motion for
Reconsideration on June 14, 1967 by registered mail, but erroneously placed as
docket number thereof, CA-G.R. No. 26772-R (J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc., vs. <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Bayang</span>),
instead of CA-G.R. No. 27311-R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Motion was attached to the <span class="SpellE"><u>expediente</u></span> of the
former case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no Motion for
Reconsideration of record in CA-G.R. No. 27311-R, the judgment against
petitioner became final, an entry of judgment was made, and the records of the
case were remanded to the lower Court for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the Appellate Court, petitioner moved to set aside the
entry of judgment on the ground that, except for the mistake in docket number,
reconsideration was timely filed so that the Decision had not yet become
final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1967</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals denied the Motion
stating:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting on the urgent motion of counsel for defendant-appellant
praying, on the grounds therein stated, that the entry of judgment in this case
be set aside and that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> be ordered to set aside its
order, dated September 30, 1967 granting the execution of the judgment; the
Court RESOLVED to DENY the motion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The present Petition was filed by petitioner assigning the
following errors to respondent Court:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Honorable Court of Appeals erred in not
resolving that the date of mailing is the date of filing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the respondent Court of Appeals erred in
entering the judgment in CA-G.R. No. 27311-R as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the respondent Court erred in not setting
aside the entry of judgment in CA-G.R. No. 27311-R."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that the judgment of the Court of Appeals
did not become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> because his Motion
for Reconsideration was filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, the date of mailing being the date of filing; that said Court failed to
act on said Motion; and that the entry of judgment was erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">In refutation, the Corporation asserts that the placing of the
wrong docket number on petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was due to his
counsel's fault; that said pleading was merely intended for delay as the Motion
for Reconsideration in the <span class="SpellE">Bayang</span> case, which was allegedly
being prepared at the time the Motion in the present case was under way, was
filed a month before the <span class="SpellE">Llantero</span> case was decided;
that the Court of Appeals acted on the Motion for Reconsideration when it
denied the Motion to Set Aside the Entry of Judgment; and that the arguments
set forth in said Motion are the same arguments repeatedly overruled by this
Court and the Court of Appeals in several other cases involving the
Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of Civil Case No. Q-3697 were remanded to the Court
of origin by the Appellate Court for execution on <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1967</st1:date> and the <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>
disposed of.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> There is no showing whether
execution of judgment had been stayed by the trial Court or not pending the
resolution of this Petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, it is best that the Petition be resolved on the merits to
set the controversy conclusively at rest.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the Petition groundless.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an established rule that the date of mailing of a motion,
pleading or any other paper, as shown by the post office registry receipt, shall
be considered as the date of their filing in Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, this is not the issue at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's Motion, although seasonably presented from the foregoing
standpoint, bore an erroneous docket number.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason, it could not be attached to the <span class="SpellE"><u>expediente</u></span>
of the correct case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To all intents and
purposes, the Motion was legally inexistent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the Court of Appeals committed no error in remanding the case to
the Court of origin for execution of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's counsel's oversight can not be considered
excusable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As claimed by the
Corporation, petitioner's counsel, who was also the lawyer in the <span class="SpellE">Bayang</span> case, had prepared the Motion for Reconsideration in
the latter suit a month before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
Motions were not being prepared at approximately the same time, as contended,
such that a mistake could have been committed, and if it had been, it was
inexcusable for having been sheer negligence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is one case where petitioner has to bear the adverse consequences
of his counsel's act, for, it has been held, a client is bound by his lawyer's
inexcusable negligence.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
No abuse of discretion, therefore, can be laid at the door of respondent Court
when it declared its judgment final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner's claim to the property in question is based
on a document of sale of <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> rights executed
by <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> Campos in favor of his son <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Llantero</span>, and on the
Compromise Agreements in Civil Cases Nos. Q-135, Q-139 and Q-174.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score, respondent Court ruled that
the trial Court aptly rejected these evidences, as it had been clearly
established that the Corporation is the registered owner of the large tract of
land, of which the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> portion forms part,
since July 8, 1914, and that neither <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
Campos, nor her predecessor-in-interest <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alquiros</span>, had been authorized to convey the portion in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further held that the
Compromise Agreement upon which petitioner predicated his right, had already
been rescinded and set aside by this Court in Deudor, et al. vs. J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp;Co., Inc., 2 SCRA 129 (1961).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's arguments in his Motion for
Reconsideration were a mere reiteration of his evidence presented to the trial
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly then, the Motion for
Reconsideration, even if correctly numbered, was <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u>, filed
to gain time, and could not toll the running of the period of appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing considered, the entry of judgment made by
respondent Appellate Court must be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is hereby dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Costs against petitioner.</p>
