This is a Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari </em>of the Order of the
 defunct Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, Branch VI dated 
January 14, 1981, dismissing its Civil Case No. p-153, for lack of 
jurisdiction.
<p>
The pertinent antecedents are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> On July 27, 1978, petitioner as plaintiff, filed before the then 
Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, a complaint for Recognition of
 Easement with Preliminary Injunction and Damages. The complaint which 
was docketed in the aforesaid Court as Civil Case No. p-153 among others
 alleged, that plaintiff (now petitioner) and defendant Epifania Neri 
(one of the herein private respondents) are the owners of adjoining 
parcels of agricultural land situated in Cauayanan, Tinambac, Camarines 
Sur; that an irrigation canal traverses the land of defendant Neri 
through which irrigation water from the Slimod River passes and flows to
 the land of the petitioner for the latter's beneficial use; and that 
respondent Neri, owner of the land on which said irrigation canal exists
 and Senecio Ong, the cultivator of the said property, despite repeated 
demands refused to recognize the rights and title of the petitioner to 
the beneficial use of the water passing through the aforesaid irrigation
 canal and to have petitioner's rights and/or claims annotated on the 
Certificate of Title of respondent Neri….. Hence, the filing of the said
 complaint. </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    In their Answer, private respondents denied the existence of any 
right on the part of the petitioner to the use of the canal mentioned in
 the complaint nor any contract, much less any deed or encumbrance on 
their property and assert that they have not performed any act 
prejudicial to the petitioner that will warrant the filing of the 
complaint against them. By way of affirmative and special defenses, 
private respondents alleged that petitioner's complaint states no cause 
of action and that the Court has no jurisdiction over the same.
  </p>
<p>
Issues having been joined, trial was held. After petitioner has rested 
his case by a formal offer of his testimonial and documentary evidences,
 private respondents instead of presenting their evidence, filed a 
motion to dismiss. In the said motion, respondents contend that the 
instant case, involving as it does development, exploitation, 
conservation and utilization of water resources falls with­in the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the National Water Resources Council pursuant 
to P.D. NO. 424, Section 2(b) and Section 88 thereof. Acting on private 
respondents' motion, respondent Judge dismissed petitioner's complaint 
for lack of jurisdiction in an Order dated January 14, 1981. The 
pertinent portion of that Order reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x The basis of the motion to dismiss are the provisions of 
Presidential Decree No. 424 and the Water Code known as Presidential 
Decree No. 1067. In opposing the motion to dismiss, plaintiff contends 
that the present action does not involve water dispute and that since 
the present action was filed before the court prior to the effectivity 
of the Presidential Decree No. 424, it is the old law on the matter that
 should be applied. These contentions of the plaintiff are with­out 
merit. The complaint belies the plaintiff's contention. Allegations in 
the complaint are explicit regarding the claim of the right of plaintiff
 over the water passing through his land. The right over irri­gation 
water not having been shown as established or vested or that said vested
 right, if any, has not been alleged to be registered in accordance with
 the water code, the provisions of Presidential Decrees 424 and 1067 
shall govern. As stated by the Supreme Court in the case of Abe-Abe vs. 
Manta, No. L-4827, May 31, 1979, 90 SCRA 523, to wit: </p>
  <p> "It is incontestable that the petitioner's immediate recourse is 
to ventilate their grievance with the National Water Resources Council 
which, as already noted, is the administrative agency exclusively vested
 with original jurisdiction to settle water rights disputes under the 
water code under Presidential Decree No. 424. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The code assumes that it is more expeditious and pragmatic to entrust to
 an administrative agency the settlement of water rights disputes rather
 than require the claimants to go directly to the court where the 
proceedings are subject to unavoidable delays which are deterimental to 
the parties x x x
</p><p>
That jurisdiction of the Council under Section 2(b) of Presidential 
Decree No. 424 is reaffirmed in Sec. 88 of the Water Code and in Section
 3(d) thereof which provides that 'the utilization, exploitation, 
development, conservation and protection of water resources shall be 
subject to the control and regu­lation of the government through 
Council."
</p><p>
Failing to obtain a favorable reconsideration of the Order of dismissal,
 petitioner now comes before Us through the instant petition contending:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (1) That the case at bar is not to settle any water dispute between 
the parties but a complaint which calls purely for a determination of 
the right of the plaintiff to have an established right amounting to an 
easement annotated on the certificate of title of the defendant, hence 
the question is judicial which may be taken cognizance of by the 
respondent court;
  </p>
  <p>
    (2) That since the case was filed on July 26, 1972, which was before
 the effectivity of P.D. NO. 424, therefore even if defendant's 
contention is correct - that the case involved water rights dispute - 
the old law on water applies and not the present water code of the 
Philippines of 1976; otherwise, the Court shall lose jurisdiction by 
subsequent legislation contrary to the well-settled rule that once 
jurisdiction is acquired it cannot be lost;
  </p>
  <p>
    (3) That the herein defendant can no longer raise the question of 
plaintiff's right to the beneficial use of irrigation water since the 
right to use had already been determined, decided and laid to rest when 
the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications 
awarded petitioner Water Rights Grant after complying with all the legal
 requirements such as publication, payment of fees, survey, 
investigation, etc.; and
  </p>
  <p> (4) That the issue in the case at bar which was erro­neously 
overlooked by the respondent Judge does not in­volve a determination of 
the right of the parties to the utilization, conservation and protection
 of the parties' respective water rights, hence it does not fall within 
the competence nor jurisdiction of the National Water Resources Council.
 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In a Resolution promulgated on August 11, 1982, we required the 
respondents to comment on the petition. Private respondents' COMMENT was
 filed on March 2, 1984. Petitioner's REPLY thereto on the other hand 
was filed on May 10, 1984.
</p><p>
We considered the COMMENT as an Answer and gave due course to the petition.
</p><p>
Private respondents contend that the assailed order of dismissal was in 
order since a mere cursory reading of the complaint shows that 
petitioner claims for the right to use water coming from the Silmod 
River and prays that his right to the utilization thereof be respected 
and not be disturbed and/or obstructed by the respondents. On its face 
then, the dispute is on the use, conservation and protection of the 
right to water either by the petitioner or by the private respondents. 
The annotation of the alleged encumbrance on the title of the private 
respondent is merely the relief prayed for on the basis of the claim to 
the use and protection of water passing through the land of the 
respondents. And since the controversy hinges on the right to use and 
protect the water from the Silmod River that passes on the land of the 
private respondents to the petitioner's property, the proper authority 
to determine such a controversy is the National Water Resources Council 
which is vested with exclusive jurisdiction over such question pursuant 
to P.D. NOS. 424 and 1067.
</p><p>
We find the petition impressed with merit.
</p><p>
Private respondents' insistence that what is involved in the instant 
case is the right to use, exploit and convey water is controverted by 
the "STIPULATION OF FACTS" entered into between them and the petitioner 
in the court below which was approved in an Order dated February 20, 
1975, the pertinent portion of which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1. That there exists an irrigation canal for the use of the 
defendants diverting water coming from the Silmod River, Tinambac, 
Camarines Sur, passing on the ricelands of the latter to the plaintiff's
 land irrigating the land of the latter, although plaintiff claims it 
existed since 1952 up to the present, but disputed by the defendants. </p>
  <p>
    2.  <em>That the plaintiff has an approved water rights Grant issued
 by the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications</em>, which plaintiff claims it for beneficial use to irrigate their land from the Silmod River and defendants dispute said claim.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  That as of now, defendants have no approved Water Rights Grant 
issued by the proper authorities for the use of the water for irrigation
 purposes from the Silmod River. However, defendants have a pending 
application for Water Rights, the water of which shall pass thru a 
different irrigation canal.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.  That one of the defendants' predecessors-in-interest, Abundio 
Barallas had a written contract with the plaintiff, which defendants 
claim easement of aqueduct. Defendants are questioning the legality, 
enforceability and validity of such contract.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</p>
  <p> 6.  That defendants re­fused to surrender their Transfer 
Certificate of Title of her land for purposes of annotation of the 
contract, allegedly an easement of aqueduct, on the ground that she 
questions the validity, enforceability, legality and therefore they are 
not bound by the same."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
From the foregoing stipulations, private respondents admit that 
petitioner, then plaintiff, has an approved Water Rights Grant issued by
 the Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications. 
Private respondents, however, contend that the said grant does not 
pertain to the beneficial use of irrigation water from Silmod River. The
 records, however, do not show any other irrigation water going to 
petitioner's property passing thru respondents' lot aside from that 
coming from the Silmod River. Respondents' controversion of petitioner's
 right to irrigation water specifically from Silmod River is undoubtedly
 a lame denial.
</p><p>
Aside from this admission, the record clearly discloses an approved 
Water Rights Grant in favor of petitioner. Dr. Bienvenido V. Amistoso, 
which was approved on November 13, 1973 by the Acting Secretary of 
Public Works and Communications, David M. Consunji. (Exh. I) The grant 
was made three (3) years before the promulgation of P.D. 1067 on 
December 31, 1976, known as the Water Code of the Philippines, which 
revised and consolidated the laws governing ownership, appropriation, 
utilization, exploitation, development, conservation and protection of 
water resources thereby repealing among others, the provisions of the 
Spanish Law of Water of August 3, 1866, the Civil Code of Spain of 1889,
 and the Civil Code of the Philippines on ownership of water, easement 
relating to water and of public water and acquisitive prescription on 
the use of water which are inconsistent with the provisions of said Code
 (Art. 10, P.D. 1067).
</p><p>
The water rights grant partakes the nature of a document known as a <em>water permit</em> recognized under Article 13 of P.D. 1067, which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Article 13. Except as otherwise herein provided, no person, 
including government instrumentalities or government-owned or controlled
 corporations, shall appropriate water without a water right, which 
shall be evidenced by a document known as a <em>water permit</em>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<em>Water right is the privilege granted by the government</em> to appropriate and use water."
</p><p>
As to the validity of the WATER RIGHTS GRANT of Amistoso upon the 
promulgation of P.D. 1067 on December 31, 1976, the governing provision 
of law is found in the Transitory and Final Provisions of P.D. 1067. It 
falls under "acts and contracts under the regime of old laws". Article 
97 provides, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Article 97. Acts and contracts under the regime of old laws, if 
they are valid in accordance there­with, shall be respected, subject to 
the limitations established in this Code. Any modification or extension 
of these acts and contracts after the promulgation of this Code, shall 
be subject to the provisions hereof."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It may be observed that the WATER RIGHTS GRANT of Amistoso does not fall
 under "claims for a right to use water existing on or before December 
31, 1974" which under P.D. 1067 are required to be registered with the 
National Water Resources Council within two (2) years from promulgation 
of P.D. 1067, otherwise it is deemed waived and the use thereof deemed 
abandoned. It is no longer a mere "claim" inasmuch as there was already a
 GRANT by the Secretary of Public Works, Transportation and 
Communications (the official then authorized to issue said grant) on 
November 13, 1973 after complying with all the requirements then 
prescribed by law for such grant.
</p><p>
The grant contradicts the erroneous findings of the respondent Judge, 
and incontrovertibly entitles petitioner to the beneficial use of water 
from Silmod River. That right is now a vested one and may no longer be 
litigated anew so as to bring petitioner's case within the jurisdiction 
of the National Water Resources Council. To resurrect that issue - - 
right to the use of irrigation water from Silmod River - - will be 
violative of the rule on <em>res judicata</em> which also applies with 
equal vigor and effect to quasi judicial tribunal (Bril­lantes vs. 
Castro, 99 Phils. 497, Ipekdjian Merchandising, Inc. vs. Court of Tax 
Appeals, 9 SCRA 72, September 30, 1963).
</p><p>
As correctly postulated by the petitioner, the court <em>a quo</em> is 
not being asked to grant petitioner the right to use but to compel 
private respondents to recognize that right and have the same annotated 
on respondent Neri's Torrens Certificate of Title. Resort to judicial 
intervention becomes necessary because of the closure made by the 
respondents of the irri­gation canal thus depriving the petitioner to 
continue enjoying irrigation water coming from Silmod River through 
respondents' property. The interruption of the free flow of water caused
 by the refusal to re-open the closed irrigation canal constituted 
petitioner's cause of action in the court below, which decidedly do not 
fall within the domain of the authority of the National Water Resources 
Council.
</p><p>
Respondents, however, rely very heavily on the dictum laid down in the 
Abe-Abe vs. Manta, No. L-4827, May 31, 1979, 90 SCRA 524, wherein it was
 held that -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is incontestable that the petitioner's immediate recourse is 
to ventilate their grievance with the National Water Resources Council 
which, as already noted, is the administrative agency exclusively vested
 with original jurisdiction to settle water rights disputes under the 
water code and under Presidential Decree No. 424. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Code assumes that it is more expeditious and pragmatic to entrust to
 an administrative agency the settlement of water rights disputes rather
 than require the claimants to go directly to the court where the 
proceedings are subject to unavoidable delays which are detrimental to 
the parties x x x
</p><p>
That jurisdiction of the Council under Section 2(b) of Presidential 
Decree No. 424 is reaffirmed in Section 88 of the Water Code and in 
Section 3(d) thereof which provides that 'the utiliza­tion, 
exploitation, development, conservation and protection of water 
resources shall be subject to the control and regulation of the 
government through the Council."
</p><p>
The said pronouncement, however, finds no application to the instant 
case for in there, both petitioners and respondent have no established 
right emanating from any grant by any governmental agency to the use, 
appropriation and exploitation of water. In the case at bar, however, a 
grant indubitably exists in favor of the petitioner. It is the enjoyment
 of the right emanating from that grant that is in liti­gation. 
Violation of the grantee's right, who in this case is the petitioner, by
 the closure of the irrigation canal, does not bring the case anew 
within the jurisdiction of the National Water Resources Council.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the Order of the Honorable respondent Judge of January 14, 
1981, is hereby SET ASIDE. Private respondents are hereby ordered to 
RECOGNIZE petitioner's EASEMENT of water and to surrender to the 
Register of Deeds of Camarines Sur the owner's duplicate Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 14216 covering respondent Epifania Neri's 
property so that petitioner's right to the beneficial use of said 
irrigation canal and water passing through the same may be annotated 
thereon.
v
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero</em>, and <em>Escolin, JJ., </em>concur.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, J.</em>, concur in the result. Private respondents should REOPEN the irrigation canal which they closed.
</p><p>
<em>Abad Santos, J.</em>, see separate opinion.
</p><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="center">
<p align="center"><strong>SEPARATE OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
ABAD SANTOS, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
The petitioner's right to establish an easement of aqueduct over the 
lands of the private respondents appear to be indubitable in the light 
of the facts given in the main opinion. However, before the easement of 
aqueduct can be formally established certain requirements must be 
observed. I refer to the provisions of Articles 642 and 643 of the Civil
 Code. Among other things, the petitioner must show that the situation 
of the aqueduct is the most convenient and the least onerous to third 
persons and he should pay indemnity to the owners of the servient 
estates. The case should be remanded to the trial court which should 
adjudicate on these matters before the petitioner's easement of aqueduct
 is annotated on the certificates of title.
