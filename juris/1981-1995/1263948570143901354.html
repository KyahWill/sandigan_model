Sangrador, joined by her husband, Rodrigo Sangrador, Plaintiffs, versus Spouses Francisco Valderrama and Teresita Valderrama, Defendants.</i>"<br><br>The factual background of the case is narrated in the decision of the Court of Appeals as follows:<br><blockquote>"On April 11, 1983 the defendants-spouses Francisco and Teresita Valderrama obtained a P500,000 loan from Manuel Asencio payable on or before April 12, 1984, and secured by a real estate mortgage on their house and lot (actually 3 lots) in front of the Jaro Plaza in Iloilo City (Exh. 9).<br><br>"Foreseeing that they would not be able to pay the loan and redeem their property upon maturity of the loan, the defendants scouted around for money-lenders who would be willing to lend them money with which to pay off their mortgage to Asencio.<br><br>"Through the help of a loan broker, Wilson Jesena, they were able to obtain on April 6, 1984 a P1,000,000 loan from the plaintiff Teresita Sangrador, who is an aunt of Jesena, on the security of the same property which they redeemed from Asencio. The loan is evidenced by the following promissory note (Exh. B) dated April 6, 1984 providing for the payment of P1,400,000 to the creditor 'eight months after date'.<br><blockquote>'FOR VALUE RECEIVED, we jointly and severally promise to pay EVELYN J.

The corresponding adjustment in the value of the Philippine Peso shall be made in the event that at the time of the maturity of this obligation, the rate of exchange will have changed as a result of the supervening inflation.

B) and deed of mortgage. Like the trial court, We do not believe defendant Valderrama's allegation that he did not notice that the amount stated in the promissory note was P1,400,000, instead of only P1,000,000, until demands for payment were sent to him by the plaintiffs' counsel. But neither do We believe the plaintiff Evelyn Sangrador's allegation that besides the sum of P1,000,000 admittedly received by the defendants and evidenced by checks and receipts, she also gave them P400,000.00 in cash <i>without receipt.</i> This is a case, therefore, where both parties prevaricated.<br><br>"The documentary evidence preponderantly proves that the loan was only P1,000,000, not P1,400,000. The checks and receipts and the broker's computations found in Exhibit '1' show clearly that the loan was only P1,000,000. Even the broker's P50,000 commission was computed on the basis of 5% of P1 million. The circumstance that the alleged payment of P400,000 in cash to the debtors is not evidenced by a receipt, is conclusive proof that it was not a part of the loan. The loan was only P1 million.<br><br>"Obviously, the P400,000 that was added to the principal represents a hidden interest charge for the promissory note contains no express provision fixing the rate of interest on the loan."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></blockquote>Petitioners assail the foregoing findings and conclu­sions of the Court of Appeals, contending that the amount of the loan as clearly and expressly stated in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and the Promissory Note,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> is P1,400,000.00 and not P1,000,000.00 only.<br><br>Because the findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals differ on this crucial factual issue, we have carefully reviewed and examined the evidence. The finding of the Court of Appeals that the loan is in the amount of P1,000,000.00 only is supported by substantial evidence.<br><br>The Promissory Note (Exh. B) and the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage (Exh. A) executed by the respondents in favor of the petitioners indeed state that the loan is in the amount of P1,400,000.00. However, the other documents executed by the parties contemporaneously with said Promissory Note and Deed of Real Estate Mortgage clearly show that the actual loan, i.e. the amount received by respondents, was only P1,000,000.00. Thus, for the payment made by the petitioners for the account of the respondents to Manuel Asencio, thereby releasing the mortgage on the property, so that it could in turn be mortgaged to the petitioners, the respondents signed a receipt in favor of the petitioners in the amount of P625,000.00 (Exh. 2). The respondents executed another receipt in favor of the petitioners for the amount of P307,601.40 "representing full payment per promis­sory note dated 6 April 1984" (Exh. 4). The broker who arranged for the loan signed a receipt in favor of the respondents for the amount of P50,000.00 representing his commission in effecting the loan "for the amount of P1,000,000.00" (Exh. 3). The attorney who assisted in the transaction was paid attorney's fees in the amount of P4,000.00 (Exh. 8). The petitioners submitted a list of expenses chargeable to the respondents, totalling P13,398.69 covering transfer fees, expenses in the Register of Deeds and payments to the BIR (Exh. 5). All told, the loan of P1,000,000.00 obtained by the respondents from the petitioners was applied or used in the following manner at the time the loan was obtained:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="33%">P 625,000.00</td><td width="10%"><div align="center">- </div></td><td width="57%"> to pay Manuel Asencio (first creditor)</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>50,000.00</td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td> to pay Wilson Jesena (for broker's commission)</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>4,000.00 </td><td><div align="center">- </div></td><td>to pay Atty.

We find this contention to be quite incredible, to say the least. It is contrary to ordinary human experience. Normally, in delivering a hefty sum like P400,000.00 in cash, one would require some sort of receipt or acknowledgment from the recipient.<br><br>Moreover, if petitioners were careful enough to require from the respondents the separate receipts above-mentioned, there was no reason why they would not require another receipt from the respondents for said amount of P400,000.00. And if, as petitioners now allege, they did not anymore require a receipt for the P400,000.00 allegedly delivered by them in cash to the respondents because the loan amount stated in the promissory note and the real estate mortgage already included said amount of P400,000.00, then, by the same reasoning, there was no need for requiring the other separate receipts abovementioned - as the amounts they referred to were already a part of the loan amount stated in the promissory note and real estate mortgage - and yet, said separate receipts were required by petitioners of the respondents.<br><br>In short, we agree with the finding of the Court of Appeals that the disputed amount of P400,000.00 was a <i>hidden interest</i> that the petitioners had required the respondents to pay at the maturity of the loan, but said amount of P400,000.00 was not received by or delivered to the respondents. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the promis­sory note and the deed of real estate mortgage (Exhs. B and A), strangely enough, do not contain any express stipulation on interest, or rate of interest, when the loan involved therein is in the substantial amount of allegedly P1,400,000.00.<br><br>Petitioners may conceivably argue that, granting that the disputed amount of P400,000.00 is interest on the loan of P1,000,000.00, yet, in line with this Court's decision in Liam Law vs. Oriental Sawmill Co., et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> there is no longer any ceiling on interest or interest rates on loans. This may be so in a situation where the parties openly and expressly agree on a specific rate of interest to accrue on the loan but, as the Court of Appeals in its decision under review correctly pointed out, in the case at bar, no interest rate is expressly stipulated in the promissory note and deed of real estate mortgage. Circular No. 905 of the Central Bank dated 10 December 1982 provides:<br><blockquote>"Section 1. <i>The rate of interest,</i> including commissions, premiums, fees and other charges on a loan or forbearance of any money, goods, or credits, regardless of maturity and whether secured or unsecured, <i>that may be charged or collected by any person, whether natural or juridical, shall not be subject to any ceiling</i> prescribed under or pursuant to the Usury law, as amended.<br><br>"Section 2. <i>The rate of interest</i> for the loan or forbearance of any money, goods or credits and the rate allowed <i>in judgments, in the absence of express contract as to such rate of interest,</i> shall continue to be twelve per cent (12%) <i>per annum.</i>" (Underlining supplied)</blockquote>The rate of interest for loans or forbearance of money, in the absence of express contract as to such rate of interest, shall continue therefore to be twelve per cent (12%) <i>per annum.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the loan of P1,000,000.00 in the instant case should earn a twelve per cent (12%) interest <i>per annum</i> computed from 6 April 1984 when the loan was obtained by the respondents from the petitioners until paid.<br><br>Petitioners also impugn the Court of Appeals in nullifying the escalation clause in the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage and Promissory Note. Under such escalation clause, sustained by the trial court, the amount of P569,718.61 was awarded to herein petitioners by way of adjustment of the loan of P1,400,000.00 after the eight (8) month period of loan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The Deed of Real Estate Mortgage provides, among others, as follows:<br><blockquote>"14. <i>That in the event that an extra­ordinary inflation of the Philippine peso should supervene,</i> it is hereby stipulated that the value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis of payment pursuant to Art. 1250 of the New Civil Code of the Philippines. For this purpose, MORTGAGORS hereby recognize the official exchange rate of the Philippine Peso to the US Dollar at 14.002 to one. <i>The corresponding adjustment in the value of the Philippine Peso shall be made should at the time of the maturity of this obligation, the rate of exchange will have changed as a result of the supervening inflation.</i> It is further agreed that the official rate of exchange as set by the Central Bank for private transactions shall be the basis of this adjustment." (Italics supplied).</blockquote>A cursory reading of the aforequoted provision of the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage (similar stipulation is contained in the Promissory Note) shows that the escalation clause takes effect "in the event that an extraordinary inflation of the Philippine Peso should supervene," between the date the loan was granted and the date of its maturity, in which case, the value of the (peso) currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation shall be the basis of payment. To give meaning to the "value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the obligation," the parties agreed that on 6 April 1984 (date of loan), the exchange rate of the peso to the US dollar was 14.002 to one.<br><br>Consequently, under the aforesaid escalation clause, "(t)he corresponding adjustment in the value of the Philip­pine Peso" at the maturity of the obligation crucially depends upon the supervening of an extraordinary inflation in the sense contemplated in Article 1250 of the Civil Code of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In <i>Filipino Pipe and Foundry Corporation vs. National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> this Court held:<br><blockquote>“Extraordinary inflation exists when ‘there is a decrease or increase in the purcha­sing power of the Philippine currency which is unusual or beyond the common fluctuation in the value of said currency, and such decrease or increase could not have been reasonably foreseen or was manifestly beyond the contemplation of the parties at the time of the establishment of the obligation. (Tolentino Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code Vol. IV, p. 284.)<br><br>An example of extraordinary inflation is the following description of what happened to the deutschmark in 1920:<br><blockquote>'More recently, in the 1920's Germany experience a case of hyper­inflation. In early 1921, the value of the German mark was 4.2 to the U.S. dollar. By May of the same year, it had stumbled to 62 to the U.S. dollar. And as prices went up rapidly, so that by October 1923, it had reached 4.2 trillion to the U.S. dollar!' (Bernardo M. Villegas &amp; Victor R. Abola, Economics, An Introduction [Third Edition]).</blockquote>As reported, ‘prices were going up every week, then every day, then every hour. Women were paid several times a day so that they could rush out and exchange their money for something of value before what little purchasing power was left dissolved in their hands. Some workers tried to beat the constantly rising prices by throwing their money out of the windows to their waiting wives, who would rush to unload the nearly worthless paper. A postage stamp cost millions of marks and a loaf of bread, billions.' (Sidney Rutberg, 'The Money Baloon' New York; Simon and Schuster, 1975, p. 19, cited in 'Economics, An Introduction' by Villegas &amp; Abola, 3rd Ed.)<br><blockquote>'While appellant's voluminous records and statistics proved that there has been a decline in the purchasing power of the Philippine peso, this downward fall of the currency cannot be considered 'extraordinary.' It is simply a universal trend that has not spared our country."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></blockquote></blockquote>Since petitioners failed to prove the supervening of extraordinary inflation between 6 April 1984 and 7 December 1984 - no proofs were presented on how much, for instance, the price index of goods and services had risen during the intervening period - an extraordinary inflation cannot be assumed; consequently, there is no reason or basis, legal or factual, for adjusting the value of the Philippine Peso in the settlement of respondents' obligation.<br><br>Finally, the Court of Appeals did not commit any error in reducing the award of attorney's fees to P50,000.00.
