The failure to accord respect to the constitutional rights of freedom of
 peaceable assembly and free speech is the grievance alleged by 
petitioners, students of the Gregorio Araneta University Foundation, in 
this <em>certiorari</em>, prohibition and <em>mandamus </em>proceeding. 
 The principal respondents are Anastacio D. Ramento, Director of the 
National Capital Region of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports
 and the Gregorio Araneta University Foundation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  The nullification of the decision of respondent Ramento affirming the 
action taken by respon­dent Gregorio Araneta University Foundation 
finding petitioners guilty of illegal assembly and suspending them is 
sought in this petition.
<p>
The facts are not open to dispute.  Petitioners were officers of the 
Supreme Student Council of respondent University.  They sought and were 
granted by the school authorities a permit to hold a meeting from 8:00 
A.M. to 12:00 P.M. on August 27, 1982.  Pursuant to such permit, along 
with other students, they held a general assembly at the Veterinary 
Medicine and Animal Science basketball court (VMAS), the place indicated
 in such permit, not in the basketball court as therein stated but at 
the second floor lobby.  At such gathering they manifested in vehement 
and vigorous language their opposition to the proposed merger of the 
Institute of Animal Science with the Institute of Agriculture.  At 10:30
 A.M., the same day, they marched toward the Life Science Building and 
continued their rally.  It was outside the area covered by their permit.
  They continued their demonstration, giving utterance to language 
severe­ly critical of the University authorities and using mega­phones 
in the process.  There was, as a result, disturbance of the classes 
being held.  Also, the non-academic employees, within hearing distance, 
stopped their work because of the noise created.  They were asked to 
explain on the same day why they should not be held liable for holding 
an illegal assembly.  Then on September 9, 1982, they were informed 
through a memorandum that they were under preventive suspension for 
their failure to explain the holding of an illegal assembly in front of 
the Life Science Building.  The validity thereof was challenged by 
petitioners both before the Court of First Instance of Rizal in a 
petition for <em>mandamus </em>with damages against private respondents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  and before the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports.  On October
 20, 1982, respondent Ramento, as Director of the National Capital 
Region, found petitioners guilty of the charge of having violated par. 
146(c) of the Manual for Private Schools more specifically their holding
 of an illegal assembly which was characterized by the violation of the 
permit granted resulting in the disturbance of classes and oral 
defamation.  The penalty was suspension for one academic year.  Hence 
this petition.
</p><p>
On November 16, 1982, this Court issued the following resolution:  
"Acting on the urgent ex-parte motion for the immediate issuance of a 
temporary mandatory order filed by counsel for petitioners, dated 
November 12, 1982, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING 
ORDER enjoining all respondents or any person or persons acting in their
 place or stead from enforcing the order of the Ministry of Education 
and Culture dated October 20, 1982 finding the petitioners guilty of the
 charges against them and suspending them for one (1) academic year with
 a stern warning that a commission of the same or another offense will 
be dealt with utmost severity, effective as of this date and continuing 
until otherwise ordered by this Court, thus allowing them to enroll, if 
so minded."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
Both public and private respondents submitted their comments.  Private 
respondents prayed for the dismissal of the petition "for lack of 
factual and legal basis and likewise [prayed] for the lifting of the 
temporary restraining order dated November 16, 1982."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  Public respondent Ramento, on the other hand, through the Office of 
the Solicitor General, prayed for the dismissal of the petition based on
 the following conclusion:  "Consequently, it is respectfully submitted 
that respondent Director of the MECS did not commit any error, much less
 abused his discretion, when he affirmed the decision of respondent 
University finding petitioners guilty of violations of the provisions of
 the Manual of Regu­lations for Private Schools and the Revised 
Student's Code of Discipline and ordering their suspension for one (1) 
academic school year.  However, since said suspension has not been 
enforced except only briefly, thereby enabling petitioners Leonero, Jr.,
 Lucas and Malabanan to finish their courses, and allowing petitioners 
Lee and Jalos to continue their school­ing, if they so desire, this 
proceeding is now moot and academic."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
With the submission of such comments considered as the answers of public
 and private respondents, the case was ready for decision.
</p><p>
This petition may be considered moot and academic if viewed solely from 
the fact that by virtue of the temporary restraining order issued by 
this Court petitioners were allowed to enroll in the ensuing semester, 
with three of them doing so and with the other two equally entitled to 
do so.  Moreover, there is the added circumstance of more than a year 
having passed since October 20, 1982 when respondent Ramento issued the 
challenged decision suspending them for one year.  Nonetheless, with its
 validity having been put in issue, for being violative of the 
constitutional rights of freedom of peaceable assembly and free speech, 
there is need to pass squarely on the question raised.
</p><p>
This Court accordingly rules that respect for the constitutional rights 
of peaceable assembly and free speech calls for the setting aside of the
 decision of respondent Ramento, the penalty imposed being unduly 
severe.  It is true that petitioners held the rally at a place other 
than that specified in the permit and continued it longer than the time 
allowed.  Undeniably too, they did disturb the classes and caused the 
work of the non-academic personnel to be left undone.  Such undesirable 
consequence could have been avoided by their holding the assembly in the
 basketball court as indicated in the permit.  Nonetheless, suspending 
them for one year is out of proportion to their misdeed.  The petition 
must be granted and the decision of respondent Ramento nullified, a much
 lesser penalty being appropriate.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  As is quite clear from the opinion in Reyes v. Bagatsing,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 the invocation of the right to freedom of peaceable assembly carries 
with it the implication that the right to free speech has likewise been 
disregarded.  Both are embraced in the concept of freedom of expression,
 which is identified with the liberty to discuss publicly and 
truthfully, any matter of public interest without censorship or 
punishment and which "is not to be limited, much less denied, except on a
 showing * * * of a clear and present danger of a substantive evil that 
the state has a right to prevent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  In the above case, a permit was sought to hold a peaceful march 
and rally from the Luneta public park to the gates of the United States 
Embassy, hardly two blocks away, where in an open space of public 
property, a short program would be held.  Necessarily then, the question
 of the use of a public park and of the streets leading to the United 
States Embassy was before this Court.  We held that streets and parks 
have immemorially been held in trust for the use of the public and have 
been used for purposes of assembly to communicate thoughts between 
citizens and to discuss public issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 3.   The situation here is different.  The assembly was to be held
 not in a public place but in private premises, property of respondent 
University.  There is in the Reyes opinion as part of the summary this 
relevant excerpt: "The applicants for a permit to hold an assembly 
should inform the licensing authority of the date, the public place <em>where</em> and the time <em>when</em>
 it will take place.  If it were a private place, only the consent of 
the owner or the one entitled to its legal possession is required."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 Petitioners did seek such consent.  It was granted.  According to the 
petition: "On August 27, 1982, by virtue of a permit granted to them by 
the school administration, the Supreme Student Council where your 
petitioners are among the officers, held a General Assembly at the VMAS 
basketball court of the respondent university."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 There was an express admission in the Comment of private respon­dent 
University as to a permit having been granted for petitioners to hold a 
student assembly.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The 
specific question to be resolved then is whether on the facts as 
disclosed resulting in the discipli­nary action and the penalty imposed,
 there was an infringement of the right to peaceable assembly and its 
cognate right of free speech. </p>
  <p>
    4.   Petitioners invoke their rights to peaceable assembly and free 
speech.  They are entitled to do so.  They enjoy like the rest of the 
citizens the freedom to express their views and communicate their 
thoughts to those disposed to listen in gatherings such as was held in 
this case.  They do not, to borrow from the opinion of Justice Fortas in
 Tinker v. Des Moines Community School District,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> "shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 While, therefore, the authority of educational institutions over the 
conduct of students must be recognized, it cannot go so far as to be 
violative of constitutional safeguards.  On a more specific level, there
 is persuasive force to this formulation in the Fortas opinion: "The 
principal use to which the schools are dedicated is to accommodate 
students during prescribed hours for the purpose of certain types of 
activities.  Among those activities is personal intercommunication among
 the students.  This is not only an inevitable part of the process of 
attending school; it is also an important part of the educational 
process.  A student's rights, therefore, do not embrace merely the 
classroom hours.  When he is in the cafeteria, or on the playing field, 
or on the campus during the authorized hours, he may express his 
opinions, even on controversial subjects like the conflict in Vietnam, 
if he does so without ‘materially and substantially interfer[ing] with 
the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the 
school’ and without colliding with the rights of others.  * * * But 
conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any 
reason-whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior-materially
 disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the 
rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional 
guarantee of freedom of speech."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    5.   As tested by such a standard, what is the verdict on the 
complaint of petitioners that there was a disregard of their 
constitutional rights to peaceable assembly and free speech.  It must be
 in their favor, but subject to qualification, in view of their 
continuing their demonstration in a place other than that specified in 
the permit for a longer period and their making use of megaphones 
therein, resulting in the disruption of classes and the stoppage of work
 by the non-academic personnel in the vicinity of such assembly.
  </p>
  <p> 6.   Objection is made by private respondents to the tenor of the 
speeches by the student leaders.  That there would be a vigorous 
presentation of views opposed to the proposed merger of the Institute of
 Animal Science with the Institute of Agriculture was to be expected.  
There was no concealment of the fact that they were against such a move 
as it confronted them with a serious problem ("<em>isang malaking suliranin</em>.")<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> They believed that such a merger would result in the increase in tuition fees, an additional headache for their parents ("<em>isa na naman sakit sa ulo ng ating mga magulang</em>.").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
 If in the course of such demonstration, with an enthusiastic audience 
goading them on, utterances, extremely critical, at times even 
vitriolic, were let loose, that is quite understandable.  Student 
leaders are hardly the timid, diffident types.  They are likely to be 
assertive and dogmatic.  They would be ineffective if during a rally 
they speak in the guarded and judicious language of the academe.  At any
 rate, even a sympathetic audience is not disposed to accord full 
credence to their fiery exhortations.  They take into account the 
excitement of the occasion, the propensity of speakers to exaggerate, 
the exuberance of youth.  They may give the speakers the benefit of 
their applause, but with the activity taking place in the school 
premises and during the daytime, no clear and present danger of public 
disorder is discernible.  This is without prejudice to the taking of 
disciplinary action for conduct, which, to borrow from Tinker, 
"materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or 
invasion of the rights of others."
  </p>
  <p>
    7.   Nor is this a novel approach to the issue raised by petitioners
 that they were denied the right to peaceable assembly.  In a 1907 
decision, United States v. Apurado,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 the facts disclosed that shortly before the municipal council of San 
Carlos, Occidental Negros, started its session, some five hundred 
residents of the municipality assembled near the municipal building, 
and, upon the opening of the session, a substantial number of such 
persons barged into the council chamber, demand­ing that the municipal 
treasurer, the municipal secretary, and the chief of police be 
dismissed, submitting at the same time the proposed substitutes.  The 
municipal council gave its conformity.  Such individuals were wholly 
unarmed except that a few carried canes; the crowd was fairly orderly 
and well-behaved except in so far as their pressing into the council 
chamber during a session of that body could be called disorder and 
misbehavior.  It turned out that the movement had its origin in 
religious differences.  The defendant Filomeno Apurado and many other 
participants were indicted and convicted of sedition in that they 
allegedly prevented the municipal government from freely exercising its 
duties.  On appeal, the Supreme Court reversed.  Justice Carson, who 
penned the opinion, correctly pointed out that "if the prosecution be 
permitted to seize upon every instance of such disorderly conduct by 
individual members of a crowd as an excuse to characterize the assembly 
as a seditious and tumultuous rising against the authorities, then the 
right to assemble and to petition for redress of grievances would become
 a delusion and a snare and the attempt to exercise it on the most 
righteous occasion and in the most peaceable manner would expose all 
those who took part therein to the severest form of punishment, if the 
purposes which they sought to attain did not happen to be pleasing to 
the prosecuting authorities."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
 The principle to be followed is enunciated thus: "If instances of 
disorderly conduct occur on such occasions, the guilty individuals 
should be sought out and punished therefor, but the utmost discretion 
must be exercised in drawing the line between <em>disorderly </em>and <em>seditious</em> conduct and between an essentially peaceable assembly and a tumultuous uprising."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
  A careful reading of this decision is in order before private 
respondents attach, as they did in their comments, a subversive 
character to the rally held by the students under the leadership of 
petitioners.
  </p>
  <p> 8.   It does not follow, however, that petitioners can be totally 
absolved for the events that transpired.  Admittedly, there was a 
violation of the terms of the permit.  The rally was held at a place 
other than that specified, in the second floor lobby, rather than the 
basketball court, of the VMAS building of the University.  Moreover, it 
was continued longer than the period allowed.  According to the decision
 of respondent Ramento, the "concerted activity [referring to such 
assembly] went on until 5:30 p.m."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
  Private respondents could thus take disciplinary action.  On those 
facts, however, an admonition, even a censure - certainly not a 
suspension - could be the appropriate penalty.  Private respondents 
could and did take umbrage at the fact that in view of such infraction -
 considering the places where and the time when the demonstration took 
place - there was a disruption of the classes and stoppage of work of 
the non-academic personnel.  They would not be unjustified then if they 
did take a much more serious view of the matter.  Even then a one-year 
period of suspension is much too severe.  While the discretion of both 
respondent University and respondent Ramento is recognized, the rule of 
reason, the dictate of fairness calls for a much lesser penalty.  If the
 concept of proportionality between the offense committed and the 
sanction imposed is not followed, an element of arbitrariness intrudes. 
 That would give rise to a due process question.  To avoid this 
constitutional objection, it is the holding of this Court that a 
one-week suspension would be punishment enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    9.   One last matter.  The objection was raised that petitioners 
failed to exhaust administrative remedies.  That is true, but hardly 
decisive.  Here, a purely legal question is presented.  Such being the 
case, especially so where a decision on a question of law is 
imperatively called for, and time being of the essence, this Court has 
invariably viewed the issue as ripe for adjudication.  What cannot be 
too sufficiently stressed is that the constitutional rights to peaceable
 assembly and free speech are invoked by petitioners.  Moreover, there 
was, and very likely there will continue to be in the future, militancy 
and assertiveness of students on issues that they consider of great 
importance, whether concerning their welfare or the general public.  
That they have a right to do as citizens entitled to all the protection 
in the Bill of Rights.
  </p>
  <p>
    10.   It would be most appropriate then, as was done in the case of Reyes v. Bagatsing,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 for this Court to lay down the principles for the guidance of school 
authorities and students alike.  The rights to peaceable assembly and 
free speech are guaranteed students of educational insti­tutions.  
Necessarily, their exercise to discuss matters affecting their welfare 
or involving public interest is not to be subjected to pre­vious 
restraint or subsequent punishment unless there be a showing of a clear 
and present danger to a substantive evil that the state has a right to 
present.  As a corollary, the utmost leeway and scope is accorded the 
content of the placards displayed or utterances made.  The peaceable 
character of an assembly could be lost, how­ever, by an advocacy of 
disorder under the name of dissent, whatever grievances that may be 
aired being susceptible to correction through the ways of the law.  If 
the assembly is to be held in school premises, permit must be sought 
from its school authorities, who are devoid of the power to deny such 
request arbitrarily or unreasonably.  In granting such permit, there may
 be conditions as to the time and place of the assembly to avoid 
disruption of classes or stoppage of work of the non-academic personnel.
  Even if, however, there be violations of its terms, the penalty 
incurred should not be disproportionate to the offense. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is granted.  The decision dated October 20, 1982
 of respondent Ramento imposing a one-year suspension is nullified and 
set aside.  The temporary restraining order issued by this Court in the 
resolution of November 18, 1982 is made permanent.  As of that date, 
petitioners had been suspended for more than a week.  In that sense, the
 one-week penalty had been served.  No costs.
