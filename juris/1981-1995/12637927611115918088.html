"A", also Exhibit "1" for defendant).</p>

<blockquote>Apart from the stipulations in the printed portion of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> deed of mortgage, there appears a rider typed
at the bottom of the reverse side of the document under the lists of the proper­ties
mortgaged which reads, as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in">'AND IT IS FURTHER AGREED that in the event
the Sales Patent on the lot applied for by the Mortgagors as herein stated is
released or issued by the Bureau of Lands, the Mortgagors hereby authorize the
Register of Deeds to hold the Registration of same until this Mortgage is
cancelled, or to anno­tate this encumbrance on the Title upon authority from
the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, which title with annotation,
shall be released in favor of the herein Mortgage.'</p>

<blockquote>From the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> stipulation, it is
obvious that the mortgagee (defendant Prudential Bank) was at the outset aware
of the fact that the mortgagors (plain­tiffs) have already filed a
Miscellaneous Sales Application over the lot, <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
rights over which, were mortgaged to it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exhibit "A" (Real Estate Mortgage) was registered under
the Provisions of Act 3344 with the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>
on November 23, 1971.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 2, 1973, plaintiffs secured an additional loan from
defendant Pruden­tial Bank in the Sum of P20,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To secure payment of this additional loan,
plaintiffs executed in favor of the said defendant another deed of Real Estate
Mortgage over the same properties pre­viously mortgaged in Exhibit
"A". (Exhibit "B"; also Exhibit "2" for
defendant).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This second deed of real
Estate Mortgage was likewise registered with the Registry of Deeds, this time
in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City, on May 2, 1973.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 24, 1973, the Secretary of Agriculture issued
Miscellaneous Sales Patent No. 4776 over the parcel of land, <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> rights over which were mortgaged to defendant
Prudential Bank, in favor of plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of the aforesaid Patent, and upon its transcrip­tion in the
Registration Book of the Province of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
Original Certificate of Title No. P-2554 was issued in the name of Plaintiff
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Magcale</span>, by the Ex­-<span class="SpellE">Oficio</span>
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, on May 15, 1972.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For failure of plaintiffs to pay their obligation to defendant Bank
after it became due, and upon application of said defendant, the deeds of Real
Estate Mortgage (Exhibits "A" and "B") were <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> foreclosed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequent to the foreclosure was the sale of the properties therein
mortgaged to defend­ant as the highest bidder in a public auction sale
conducted by the defendant City Sheriff on April 12, 1978 (Exhibit
"E").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The auction sale
aforesaid was held despite written request from plain­tiffs through counsel,
dated March 29, 1978, for the defendant City Sheriff to desist from going with
the scheduled public auction sale (Exhibit "D")." (Decision,
Civil Case No. 2443-0, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 29-31).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court, in a Decision dated November 3, 1978 declared
the deeds of Real Estate Mortgage as null and void (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 35).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1978, petitioner filed a Motion for

January 5, 1979 (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 54-62), and in an Order dated January 10,
1979 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 63), the Motion for Reconsideration was denied for lack
of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant petition (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 5-28).</p>

<p class="BODY">The First Division of this Court, in a Resolution dated March 9,

order was complied with the Resolution dated May 18, 1979, (<u>Ibid</u>., p.

OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Memorandum for
Petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 122).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue in this case is whether or not a valid real
estate mortgage can be constituted on the building erected on the land
belonging to another.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer is in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the enumeration of properties under Article 415 of the Civil
Code of the Philippines, this Court ruled that, "it is obvious that the
inclusion of 'building' separate and distinct from the land, in said provision
of law can only mean that a building is by itself an immovable
property".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Lopez vs. <span class="SpellE">Orosa</span>, Jr., et al., L-10817-18, Feb. 28, 1958; Associated
Inc. and Surety Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Iya</span>, et al.,
L-10837-38, May 30, 1958).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while it is true that a mortgage of land necessarily
includes, in the absence of stipulation of the improvements thereon, buildings,
still a building by itself may be mortgaged apart from the land on which it has
been built.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a mortgage would be
still a real estate mortgage for the build­ing would still be considered immovable
property even if dealt with separately and apart from the land (Leung Yee vs.
Strong Machinery Co., 37 Phil. 644).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the same manner, this Court has also established that <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
rights over said properties before title is vested on the grantee, may be
validly transferred or conveyed as in a deed of mortgage (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de Bautista vs. Marcos, 3 SCRA 438 [1961]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming back to the case at bar, the records show, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> that the original mortgage deed on the 2-storey
semi-concrete residential building with ware­house and on the right of
occupancy on the lot where the building was erected, was executed on November
19, 1971 and registered under the provisions of Act 3344 with the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> on November 23, 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Miscellaneous Sales Patent No. 4776 on the
land was issued on April 24, 1872, on the basis of which OCT No. 2554 was
issued in the name of private respondent Fernando <span class="SpellE">Magcale</span>
on May 15, 1972.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore without
question that the original mortgage was executed before the issuance of the
final patent and before the government was divested of its title to the land,
an event which takes effect only on the issuance of the sales patent and its
subsequent regis­tration in the Office of the Register of Deeds (<span class="SpellE">Visa­yan</span> Realty Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Meer</span>, 96
Phil. 515; Director of Lands vs. De Leon, 110 Phil. 28; Director of Lands vs. <span class="SpellE">Jurado</span>, L-14702, May 23, 1961; Pena, "Law on Natural
Resources, p. 49).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the foregoing
considerations, it is evident that the mortgage executed by private respondent
on his own building which was erected on the land belonging to the government
is to all intents and purposes a valid mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to restrictions expressly mentioned on the face of
respondents' OCT No. P-2554, it will be noted that Sections 121, 122 and 124 of
the Public Land Act, refer to land already acquired under the Public Land Act,
or any improvement thereon and therefore have no application to the assailed
mortgage in the case at bar which was executed before such eventuality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like­wise, Section 2 of Republic Act No. 730,
also a restriction appearing on the face of private respondent's title has
likewise no application in the instant case, despite its reference to
encumbrance or alienation before the patent is issued because it refers speci­fically
to encumbrance or alienation on the land itself and does not mention anything
regarding the improvements existing thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it is a different matter, as regards the second mortgage
executed over the same properties on May 2, 1973 for an additional loan of
P20,000.00 which was registered with the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City on the same date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Relative thereto, it is evi­dent that such
mortgage executed after the issuance of the sales patent and of the Original
Certificate of Title, falls squarely under the prohibitions stated in Sections
121, 122 and 124 of the Public Land Act and Section 2 of Republic Act 730, and
is therefore null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner points out that private respondents, after physically
possessing the title for five years, voluntarily surrendered the same to the
bank in 1977 in order that the mortgage may be annotated, without requiring the
bank to get the prior approval of the Ministry of Natural Resources beforehand,
thereby implicitly authorizing Prudential Bank to cause the annotation of said
mortgage on their title.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the Court, in recently ruling on viola­tions of Section
124 which refers to Sections 118, 120, 122 and 123 of Commonwealth Act 141, has
held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Nonetheless, we apply our earlier rulings because we believe that as in <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> may
not be in­voked to defeat the policy of the State neither may the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> give a validating effect to a void con­tract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is generally consider­ed that as
between parties to a contract, validity cannot be given to it by <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> if it is prohibited by law or is against public
policy (19 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 802).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not within the competence of any
citizen to barter away what public policy by law seeks to preserve (Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Puyat</span> &amp; Sons, Inc. vs. De <span class="SpellE">los</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Alino</span>, <u>supra</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Arsenal vs. IAC, 143 SCRA 54 [1986]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This pronouncement covers only the previous transaction already
alluded to and does not pass upon an new contract between the parties (<u>Ibid</u>.),
as in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should not preclude
new contracts that may be entered into between petitioner bank and private
respondents that are in accordance with the requirements of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, private respondents themselves
declare that they are not denying the legitimacy of their debts and appear to
be open to new negotiations under the law (Comment; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 95-96).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any new transaction,
however, would be subject to whatever steps the Government may take for the
reversion of the land in its favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES</b> <b>CONSIDERED</b>, the decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
City is hereby MODIFIED, declaring that the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage for
P70,000.00 is valid but ruling that the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage for an
