An earlier decision, Reyes v. Commission on Elections<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  is decisive of this controversy.  Petitioner and public respondent Commission on Elections were the same parties in that <em>certiorari </em>and <em>mandamus </em>proceeding.  This Court granted the writ of <em>certiorari </em>nullifying
 and setting aside the resolution of respondent Commission disqualifying
 petitioner to become a candidate and cancelling his certificate of 
candidacy for the position of municipal mayor of Bongabon, Oriental 
Mindoro.  As it was issued, however, on February 7, 1980 although the 
petition for disqualification was filed on January 25, 1980, he was 
voted for the position of municipal mayor in the election held on 
January 30 and was certified as having obtained more votes than his 
opponent, Jose A. Enriquez.  The February 7 resolution of the Commission
 on Elections led to the Board of Canvassers declaring Enriquez as 
mayor-elect of Bongabon.  Such proclamation was likewise nullified and 
set aside by this Court.  This Court in the same decision granted the 
writ of <em>mandamus </em>ordering respondent Board of Canvassers of 
Bongabon to proclaim in accordance with the canvass already terminated 
petitioner Reyes as mayor-elect.  The basis for the decision was the 
absence of procedural due process, petitioner not having been heard on 
the question of his being disqualified for having changed his party 
within the six-month period contrary to a constitutional provision.  
Characterizing the ban on a change of party affiliation as "both 
innovative and mandatory,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
 this Court likewise ordered:  "Thereafter, the case is referred to the 
respondent Commission on Elections so that it could proceed to pass on 
the question of the disqualification of petitioner Renato U. Reyes after
 a hearing to be conducted in accordance with the cardinal require­ments
 of procedural due process."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
<p>
Accordingly, respondent Commission set anew for hearing the 
disqualification case against petitioner.  Thereafter, he filed a motion
 to dismiss alleging lack of jurisdiction of respondent Commission on 
the ground that it had previously given due course to his certificate of
 candidacy and that he was thereafter voted for, with a majority of the 
votes being cast in his favor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  Another ground mentioned is that there is an election protest against 
the petitioner, one of the issues raised being the change of his 
political party affiliation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  In the Order denying such motion to dismiss, respondent Commission 
stated:  "Things were held in abeyance until May 19, 1980 upon notice of
 the Decision dated May 15, 1980 of the Supreme Court in the above-cited
 case, wherein it was directed, among others, that the cancellation of 
the certificate of candidacy of Reyes and the proclamation of Enriquez 
as mayor-elect were nullified; the proclamation of Reyes as mayor-elect 
was ordered; and the case was returned to the Commission for a hearing 
on the question of the disqualification of Reyes."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
It is then quite clear why as set forth at the beginning of this opinion, the decision in the first Reyes case is controlling.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  The doctrine of "the law of the case" identified as the 
opinion delivered in the former appeal is an insurmountable obstacle to 
this petition being granted. "More specifically," according to People v.
 Pinuila,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> "it means that 
whatever is once irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule 
of decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be 
the law of the case, whether correct on general principles or not, so 
long as the facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be 
the facts of the case before the Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  To the same effect is this holding in Kabigting v. Director of Prisons,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 the opinion coming from the then Justice, later Chief Justice, now 
Speaker Makalintal: "It need not be stated that the Supreme Court, being
 the Court of last resort, is the final arbiter of all legal questions 
properly brought before it and that its decision in any given case 
constitutes the law of that particular case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  Nowhere is there a more emphatic statement of such a principle than in the <em>ponencia </em>of Justice J.B.L. Reyes in People v. Olarte.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Thus: "Suffice it to say that our ruling in Case L-13027, rendered on the first appeal, constitutes <em>the law of the case,</em> and even if erroneous, it may no longer be disturbed or modified since it has become final long ago."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  The all-embracing scope of such a principle was duly noted in the latest case in point, Festin v. Faderanga<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
 in these words: "What is express as well as what is implied in a 
decision is included, to be implemented faithfully, no circumvention or 
evasion being allowed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  Petitioner, however, seeks to escape from the imperative 
character of such a principle.  His reliance is on what was said in 
Arcenas v. Commission on Elections:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 "It is now the prevailing doctrine that after an election duly held and
 a proclamation thereafter made, a pre-proclamation controversy should 
no longer be viable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  Such reliance is misplaced.  Arcenas and the cases cited therein<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 dealt with petitions filed with this Court, not previously decided.  
This is not the situation here.  This is the second time for petitioner 
to come to this Court.  He was successful the first time he sought 
relief.  The decision in his favor ordered precisely what should be done
 by respondent Commission.  Now that it is performing such a task 
hearing the evidence to satisfy the demands of procedural due process on
 the question of whether or not, he should be disqualified, petitioner 
files a new action to stop it from going ahead.  It is hardly in 
consonance with equity to indulge him in his change of mind.  That is an
 affront to reason.  It is offensive to fairness, which is the essence 
of due process.  Considering the difference in the environmental 
circumstances between this case and Arcenas, petitioner cannot be heard 
to argue that there was a modification of the doctrine announced in the 
first Reyes decision.  Even if there were, however, petitioner is still 
not entitled to the remedy now sought.  Justice J.B.L. Reyes in the same
 Olarte opinion cannot be any more categorical: "A subsequent 
reinterpretation of the law may be applied to new cases but certainly 
not to an old one finally and conclusively determined."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  The other ground alleged by petitioner for the dismissal of the 
proceedings in respondent.  Commission is that there is another action 
pending in Court for the same cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 It is alleged in his petition: "In March 1980, Jose A. Enriquez, the 
losing candidate, filed with the Court of First Instance of Oriental 
Mindoro an election protest against the election of petitioner, docketed
 as Election Case No. R-8, which to date is still pending."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
 Clearly, such a ground is unavailing.  Petitioner pleaded and succeeded
 in his first case to get a favorable decision on May 15, 1980.  That 
was two months after the filing of the election protest against him.  He
 was quite content with the result.  He knew then that the matter was 
referred back to respondent Commission.  He did not seek any change or 
modification.  What other con­clusion can there be then except full 
awareness and recog­nition on his part that according to law, respondent
 Commission is precisely the agency to receive evidence on the question 
of whether or not he ought to be dis­qualified.  Now he would assert 
lack of jurisdiction on the ground of another action pending in Court 
for the same cause.  In the first place, the principle of the law of the
 case is, as set forth previously, an insurmountable obstacle.  Even in 
the absence of such a principle, petition still is doomed to fail.  The 
Election Code mandates:  "The Commission shall be the sole judge of all 
pre-proclamation controversies and any of its deci­sions, orders, and 
rulings shall be final and executory."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>

DISSENTING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
ABAD SANTOS, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
The judgment in <em>Reyes vs. Commission on Elections</em>, G.R. No. 52699, May 15, 1980, 97 SCRA 500, 510 states:
</p><p>
"WHEREFORE, the writ of <em>certiorari </em>is granted and the 
resolution of respondent Com­mission on Elections of February 7, 1980 
declaring petitioner Renato U. Reyes and the proclamation of respondent 
Board of Canvassers declaring Jose A. Enriquez as Mayor-elect of 
Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro, are hereby nullified, set aside and 
declared to be without force and effect.  The writ of <em>mandamus </em>is
 granted and respondent Board of Canvassers of Bongabong, Oriental 
Mindoro, is commanded to proclaim, in accordance with the canvass 
already terminated, petitioner Renato U. Reyes as Mayor-elect.  
Thereafter, the case is referred to the respondent Commission on 
Elections so that it could proceed to pass on the question of the 
disqualification of petitioner Renato U. Reyes after a hearing to be 
conducted in accordance with the cardinal requirements of procedural due
 process."
</p><p>
I gave my assent to the judgment but after thinking more about it, I am 
now prepared to withdraw my assent to the last sentence thereof which 
refers to the Commission on Elections the question of the 
disqualification of Reyes with the injunction that procedural due 
process should be followed.  My reasons are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  The status of political parties during the regime of martial 
law and thereafter up to January 30, 1980, when elections for local 
offices were held was so uncertain and nebulous that one could not 
really say whether or not there was "turncoatism" by any candidate.  The
 vague­ness of the situation made the concept of "turncoatism" 
constitutionally infirm. </p>
  <p>
    2.  Reyes obtained more votes than Enriquez, his rival.  Considering
 that provisions of the Election Code are mandatory before but directory
 after the election, the only suit to which Reyes should be exposed is 
that of an election protest.  An inquiry whether he was disqualified 
because of turncoatism should no longer be viable.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the light of the foregoing, I vote to grant the petition.
</p><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="center">
<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
AQUINO, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
In G. R. No. 52699, <em>May 15, 1980,</em> Reyes vs. Comelec, 97 SCRA 
500, this Court directed the Comelec to nullify the proclamation of Jose
 A. Enriquez as mayor of Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro and, instead, to 
proclaim Renato U. Reyes and to hold a hearing on the pending 
disqualification case against Reyes filed by Ernesto Liwanag, identified
 as Comelec Case PP No. 374.
</p><p>
When the case was returned to the Comelec, Reyes, instead of proceeding 
with the disqualification case against him, moved to dismiss it on the 
ground that there was pending in the Court of First Instance an election
 protest filed by Enriquez against Reyes in March, 1980 and docketed as 
Election Case No. R-8.
</p><p>
The Comelec denied Reyes' motion to dismiss.  Reyes filed on <em>March 11, 1981 </em>in this Court the instant case, G. R. No. 56385, insisting that the Comelec should dismiss the disqualification case.
</p><p>
The petition is without merit because, as pointed out by the Chief 
Justice, the ruling in the 1980 case is the law of the case.  The 
disqualification case is a pre-proclamation controversy.  It can 
co-exist with the electoral protest case because the issues are 
different.
</p><p>
As the matter involves the 1980 elections, there is a pressing urgency for the early resolution of the two cases.
</p><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="center">
<p class="style2" align="center">
DISSENTING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
TEEHANKEE, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
As stated in my separate opinion in the earlier decision in <em>Reyes vs. Commission on Elections</em> (97 SCRA 500, 511-516):
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I have previously urged that all such pre-election cases seeking 
to disqualify the winner on the ground of alleged turncoatism should be 
ordered dismissed after the elections, subject to the filing of an 
appropriate quo warranto action or election protest against the winner 
in the appropriate forum (the Comelec for provincial and city officials 
and the proper Court of First Instance for municipal officials).  This 
coincides with the President's own view as he was reported in the 
February 27, 1980 newspapers 'to have ordered the lawyers of the KBL 
[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan] to withdraw all disqualification charges to 
allow already proclaimed opposition candidates involved in such cases to
 assume office,' reserv­ing the right to file an election protest 
(although such Presidential orders seem to have been ignored since I am 
not aware of any of the numerous disqualification cases before us that 
have been so withdrawn)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For the reasons and considerations set forth in my said opinion, as well
 as in the separate dissenting opinion filed by Mr. Justice Abad Santos,
 I am constrained to dissent from the majority judgment that would allow
 the continuance - at this late stage - of the disqualification case 
against petitioner "as a pre-proclamation controversy," when petitioner 
has all this time been proclaimed and assumed office as the duly elected
 mayor of Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro.  To continue with the 
pre-proclamation controversy is to go against the reality that his 
opponent, the losing candidate Jose A. Enriquez, had since March 1980, 
within the reglementary period, filed an election protest against the 
election of petitioner, which to date is still pending and unacted upon -
 and which by all standards is the proper recourse of said losing 
candidate.  (See majority opinion at pp. 3-6).
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, I vote to grant the petition.
