the Order (pp. 38-40, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) of <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer-Calleja</span>, Director of
Bureau of Labor Relations in BLR Case No. <span class="GramE">A-10-259-86 which

election with the Regional Office No.111 of the Department of Labor and
Employment in San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition alleged that MAGKAISA-ADLO is a
legitimate labor organization duly registered with the Ministry of Labor and
Employment; that there are more or less fifty-four (54) rank and file employees
in SAJELCO; that almost 62% of the employees sought to be represented have
supported the filing of the petition; that there has been no valid
certification election held in SAJELCO during the twelve (12) month period
prior to the filing of the petition and that there is no other union in the
bargaining unit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In its answer (pp. 19-21,

the Cooperative may have, and that such "some" of said alleged
supporters, in their capacity as member-consumers, enjoy two personalities in
that as employees and/or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">members of the
General Assembly, and therefore cannot fairly and prudently represent such
opposing personalities that merge into one juridical or natural person, </span>and
these special and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unique status or personalities
of the supposed supporters cannot qualify to be represented by the petitioner,
without doing injustice, in equity and </span>unfair status <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>advantage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

becoming employees;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No valid and lawful
representation can be obtained by petitioner in behalf of the supposed
supporters, who are also member-consumers, that are bound by the Articles of
Incorporation, By-laws of the respondent Cooperative and pertinent Decrees and
laws, to support and defend the basic policies of the government on Electric
Cooperatives;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
possible legal way by which to dismantle the personalities of some of the
supporters of the petitioner, as employees, from their status as
consumer-members, who, are, under the By-laws, part and parcels of the General
or Special Assembly that finally decides any dispute, and no reasonable or
valid scale of justice could be invoked to divide a person who, in conscience,
is also the other fellow against whom a remedy is sought for in allowing this
to happen is tantamount to slaughtering a man to his own ends;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

13.0pt">from this Court enjoining the holding thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, Atty. Soto was of the opinion that
in view of the direct certification election conducted, the </span>petition
brought before this Court by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">SAJELCO has
</span>become moot and academic (p. 48, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attached to his letter is a copy of the
minutes of the certification election held on <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1987</st1:date> showing that of forty three (43) employees

its comment dated </span><st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">October 30, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> wherein it took a stand contrary to that of
respondent Director.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To support its
stand, the Solicitor General argued firstly, that the union-members who seek to
be represented by the union are the very members of the cooperative, thereby
resulting in a fusion of two personalities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it will be inconsistent for the union-members to bargain with
themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, he said that
article 243 of the Labor Code requires that before one can form, join or assist
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">labor union, he must first be employed and to be an employee one must
be under hire and must have no involvement in the ownership of the firm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A labor union is formed for purposes of
collective bargaining.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The duty to
bargain exists only between employer and employees and not between an employer
and his co-owners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, he also said
that under the National Electrification Decree (P.D. No. 269, August 6, 1973)
members of an electric cooperative such as petitioner, besides contributing
financially to its establishments and maintenance, participate in its
management.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the latter aspect, they
possess the powers and prerogatives of managerial employees who are not
eligible to join, assist or form any labor organization (pp. 4-6 of Comment;
pp. 43-45, </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Solicitor General (p. 47, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the notices sent to him were
returned and stamped "moved to an unknown address." But respondent
Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations filed a comment on the aforesaid
comment of the Solicitor General reiterating his stand that members of private
respondent union fall under the general provision of Article 244 of the Code on
who are qualified to form, join or assist in the formation of unions as they
are neither managerial employees nor persons belonging to subversive
organizations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="25" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">May 25,

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The only issue presented
for resolution in this petition is whether or not the employees-members of an

<blockquote>"An employee therefore of such a cooperative who is a member
and co-owner thereof cannot invoke the right to collective bargaining for
certainly an owner cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bargain with
himself </span>or his co<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">-owners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the opinion of </span><st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">August 14, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> of the Solicitor General he correctly opined

have no right to form or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">join </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">labor organizations for purposes of

workers to organization, collective bargaining, negotiations and others as are
enshrined in the Constitution and existing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">laws of the country."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, San Jose City Electric Service Cooperative,
Inc. (SAJELCO) claims that its employees are also members of the
cooperative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cited Section 17(18) of its
By-laws which declares that:</p>

<blockquote>"The Board shall also create positions for subordinate
employees and fix their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">duties and
remunerations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><u>Only</u> <u>member-consumers</u>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The above-cited
provision, however, mentions two types of employees, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the members-consumers and the members of
their immediate families.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As regards
employees of SAJELCO who are members-consumers, the rule is settled that they
are not qualified to form, join or assist labor organizations for purposes of
collective bargaining.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason for
withholding from employees of a cooperative who are members-co-owners the right
to collective bargaining is clear:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>an
owner cannot bargain with himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
employees who are not members-consumers may form, join or assist labor
organizations for purposes of collective bargaining notwithstanding the fact
that employees of SAJELCO who are not members-consumers were employed ONLY
because they are members of the immediate family of members-consumers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that they are not themselves
members-consumers, and as such, they are entitled to exercise the rights of all
workers to organization, collective bargaining, negotiations and others as are
enshrined in Section 8, Article III and Section 3, Article XIII of the 1987
Constitution, Labor Code of the Philippines and other related laws (Cooperative
