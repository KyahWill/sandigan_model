Appeals pursuant to Section 13, Rule 124 of the Rules of Court after it had
reviewed the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 115,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">the Court of Appeals certified to Us the
instant case for final determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as found by the trial court and the Court
of Appeals, are as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The evidence revealed that the victim Freddie Flores <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">was </span>the son of Leonida Flores; that
the accused and the victim were friends; that Leonida Flores had known the
accused for seven years; that on December 2, 1986, about 10 in the evening the
accused, accompanied by Atoy Silvestre and one alias Dodong dropped by the
place at 199 Kalayaan Compound in Malibay, Pasay and invited the victim for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>stroll,
at the Plaza in Malibay.  Leonida Flores
did not know where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">they </span>would
go; she did not easily give her consent to the invitation.  That shortly, after her son left with the
accused and his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">companions, </span>Leonida
Flores asked her nephew, Gerardo Unawa, to follow Freddie Flores.  Evelyn Flores whom her mother had also
asked, left and followed Freddie Flores to the Plaza.  That it did not take long after she left, Evelyn returned to the
house and informed her mother, that something bad happened to her Freddie
Flores.  She saw at the Plaza Gerardo
Unawa holding her brother lying on the ground with head injuries.  At the Plaza Leonida Flores found her son,
lying on the ground and bleeding.  They
rushed him to the Philippine General Hospital in a taxi where he was treated.  At the Hospital Leoni­da Flores, was able to
talk with Freddie.  When she asked him
who hit him on the head.  Freddie Flores
told her that it was Leonardo Claudio.  That she asked her son how he feels and the victim answered; that (he] <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">may not survive.  Evelyn Flores was present and she heard Freddie Flores told [sic]
that to her mother.  Freddie Flores died
on December 9, .1986 (Exh. A).  That as
per the Autopsy Report rendered by Dr. Maximo Reyes, who conducted the Autopsy,
the victim suffered:</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="3Q">'Lungs, heavy, voluminous, soggy and violaceous, mottled in

<p class="3Q">'Stomach, 1/4 filled with brownish fluid mate­rials.'</p>

<p class="2Q">"The evidence also disclosed that Gerardo Unawa, who followed
the victim to the Plaza, saw Leonardo Claudio the accused hit Freddie Flores on
the head [with] a lead pipe from behind; that at the time Atoy Silvestre was
talking with Freddie Flores when he was hit with the lead pipe, measuring 3/4
inch thick and about half meter long.  Gerardo Unawa was 10 - 15 meters away at the time when he shouted to the
accused, Nardo, he run together with his companions Atoy Silvestre and alias
Dodong (TSN, Oct. 20/87).  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(Records, pp. 164-165)." (p. 68, Rollo:

<p class="BODY">The following information for Murder was filed against
defendant-appellant Leonardo Claudio in the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City,
Branch 115:</p>

<p class="2Q">"That on or about the 2nd day of December, 1986, in Pasay
City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, Leonardo Claudio, with intent to kill and by
means of treachery, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously,
suddenly, unexpectedly and without warning, and to insure that there would not
be any risk to himself, attack, assault and hit Freddie Flores with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>pipe said
accused was then provided with, inflicting upon said Freddie Flores <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">fatal injuries </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">When arraigned on July 23, 1987, appellant entered a plea of not
guilty.  Trial ensued thereafter, and on
December 29, 1988, the trial court rendered judgment convicting the
accused.  The dispositive portion of the
decision reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"All the premises considered and finding the accused guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, the Court sentences Accused
LEONARDO CLAUDIO to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Temporal maximum to
Reclusion Perpetua (the death penalty having been abolished in the 1987
Constitution).  Consid­ering the absence
of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the imposable penalty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in its medium
period or </span>from 18 years, 8 months and 1 day to 20 years.  For pur­poses of the Indeterminate Sentence
Law, the penalty next lower to that prescribed for the offense is pri<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sion mayor in its maximum period to reclusion
temporal in its medium period or from 10 years and 1 day to 17 years and 4
months, to indemnify the heirs of Eddie Flores for his death the amount of
P20.000.00 and to reimburse them for hospitaliza­tion and burial expenses of
P7,469.46 and to pay the cost of the proceedings." (pp. 167-168, Records.)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused appealed to the Court of Appeals alleging that the
trial court erred:</p>

<p class="2Q">1.  in giving full and
total credence to the testimonies of prosecution witnesses;</p>

<p class="2Q">2.  in failing to
appreciate the evidence in favor of the ac­cused-appellant; and</p>

<p class="2Q">3.  in convicting the
accused appellant when his guilt has not been duly proved beyond reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found no cogent reason to disturb the
judgment of the trial court, but it in­creased the penalty meted to the accused
from <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> <u>temporal</u> </span>to <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> <u>perpetua</u>, </span>and likewise increased his civil liability
from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00.  However,
pursuant to Section 13 of Rule 124, it did not enter judgment but certified <u>sua</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">sponte</span></u> the case to us for
final determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bereft of merit is appellant's contention that the trial court
erred in giving full credit to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses who
were relatives of the victim: Leonida Flores being his mother, Evelyn Flores,
his sister, and Gerardo Unawa, a first cousin.  We have already ruled in the case of People vs. Mision, 194 SCRA 432,
that the relationship of the witnesses to the victim <u>per</u> <u>se</u> does
not affect their credibility.  Relatives
are not necessarily partial to each other.  Some relatives fight among themselves.  The factual observation of the Court of Appeals that even if the
prosecution witnesses were relatives of the victim, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>no credible evidence of bias and
prejudice on their part, is conclusive on us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant correctly argues that the testimonies of Leonida and
Evelyn that Freddie told them that it was the appellant who hit him with an
iron pipe should not have been considered by the trial court as part of the <u>res</u>
<u>qestae</u>, because the statement was made one day after the incident.  It was, however, a dying declaration for it was
made by the victim under consciousness of impending death, as he did in fact
die.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals appropriately did not give any credit to the
appellant's alibi, an alibi being the weakest of all defenses.  More so, when it is pitted against the testimony
of the eye-witness.  Gerardo Unawa, who
positively identified the appellant as the person who struck the back of the
victim's head with a lead <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">pipe, </span>and
the deceased's dying declaration to his mother and sister that it was Nardo
(appellant) who attacked him.  Leonida
and Evelyn had absolutely no reason to falsely implicate the accused for, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as far </span>as they knew, he and Freddie
were friends.  The clear and positive
identification of the accused by the prosecution wit­nesses is, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as a </span>general rule, entitled to more
weight than the accused's alibi (People vs. Arenas.  198 SCRA</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals correctly convicted the accused of murder
for the killing was attended by treachery.  The victim was attacked from behind without warning while he was engaged
in conversation with Atoy Silverstre.  The Court properly increased the imposable penalty for the crime:</p>

<p class="2Q">"But while we are four square with the findings of the trial
court, including its appreciation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
qualifying circumstance of treachery </span>we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">disagree however with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> when it sen</span>tenced
appellant to suffer the penalty of imprisonment of only ten (10) years and one
(1) day to seven<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">teen (17) years and
four (4) months.  In line with the
ruling of the Supreme Court in <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Munoz,</u> 170 SCRA
107, the penalty </span>should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>.  Indeed, and as
correctly observed by the Solicitor General: 'Under Article 248, Re­vised Penal
Code, the prescribed penalty for Murder is <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal,</u> in
</span>its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">maximum period to death,
which is 17 years, 4 months and </span>1 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">day
to death.  There being no aggravating or
mitigating circum­stances, the prescribed penalty should be imposed in its
medium period, which is <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.  </span>The imposable penalty being <u>reclu­sion</u>
<u>perpetua,</u> the provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law do not
apply.  (People's Brief. p. 14.)</p>

<p class="2Q">"Similarly, the award<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of
P30.000.00 by way of civil indemnity should be. as is hereby increased to
P50,000.00 conformably with the prevailing ruling of the Supreme Court on the
