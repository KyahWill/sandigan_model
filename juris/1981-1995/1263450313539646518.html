as the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time of his demise, <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> left a
parcel of land (home­stead land) containing 131,705 square meters covered by
Origi­nal Certificate of Title No. P-16 in his name, issued by virtue of
Homestead Patent No. <span class="GramE">V-1728.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a deed of sale executed by the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>
on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1962</st1:date>, the
homestead land was sold to the spouses Jose <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
(hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> took

O.C.T. No. <span class="GramE">P-16 and the issuance of T.C.T. No.</span> <span class="GramE">T-11135 in their names.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1963, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> constituted a
first mortgage over the homestead land, together with two other parcels of land
covered by T.C.T. Nos. 11085 and 11626 in their names, in favor of the Bank of
the Philippine Islands, (BPI) <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Branch, for a
loan of P40,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another mortgage was
constitu­ted over the said properties in 1964 in favor of Philippine Banking
Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
failed to pay their mortgage indebtedness to the BPI upon maturity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the judicial foreclosure sale that
followed, conducted by the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1967</st1:date>, BPI was the sole and
highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff's

of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on February 4, 1967, the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>
filed an action<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> against the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> for
the repurchase of the homestead land under Section 119 of the Public Land Act
(CA 141), with a prayer for damages and accounting of fruits on the ground that
they had tried to repurchase said land <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
for several times already but that the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
would not heed their request, thus constraining the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>
to file a court action for the repurchase thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BPI and Philippine Banking Corporation were
included in the action as formal party defendants, being the first and second
mortgagees, respectively, of the homestead land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="6">June
 1, 1967</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed a motion
for exten­sion of ten (10) days "from and after June 1st" to file
their answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was granted by
the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="6">June <span style="">14, </span>1967</st1:date>, the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> filed a petition to declare the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
in default for failure to file an ans­wer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On that same day, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed a
Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> the repurchase case on the ground
that the complaint states no cause of action, but said motion was denied by the
lower court on the ground that the same was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
were declared in default and the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> were
allowed to present their evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1967</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed their answer interposing the
defense that the complaint states no cause of action because from the face of
T.C.T. No. T-11135 alone, only the original patentee, <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span>,
is given the right to repur­chase the homestead land and not the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> and because the complaint does not allege that there
was a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> offer to repurchase or a valid tender of payment,
as well as an alle­gation that the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>
intended to pay not only the pur­chase price but all the other expenses of the
sale which in­cludes the necessary and useful expenses made on the thing sold,
as required under Article 1616 of the new Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a manifestation filed by the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>,
the lower court issued an Order dated December 8, 1967 declaring the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> as "having no standing" in the
proceedings therein, to which the latter filed a motion for its reconsi­deration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion, as well as their second Motion
for Reconsideration, was denied by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1969</st1:date>,
the lower court rendered a decision allowing the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>
to repurchase the homestead land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
payment by the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> of the amount of P16<span class="GramE">,000</span> representing the repurchase price to the BPI, the
latter exe­cuted a deed of conveyance over the homestead land on <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion, the lower court issued a writ of
posses­sion in favor of the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> on <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1969</st1:date>, which was served by
the City Sheriff upon the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> on <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="9">Septem­ber 8, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the possession of the homestead
land was delivered to the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> on <st1:date year="1969" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1969</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed a petition for relief from the
Decision dated <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1969</st1:date>
on the ground of excusable mistake in the counting of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period for the filing of an answer, with a prayer that the Order de­claring
them in default be lifted and that they be allowed to present their defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1969</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed a Motion to <span class="GramE">Quash</span>
the writ of possession alleging as principal grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
the absence of service on their counsel of a copy of the writ of possession, as
well as the decision of the lower court declaring the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>
entitled to repurchase the homestead land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> filed an opposition to this
Motion and prayed for the investigation of an alleged tampering of records of
the case particularly the page containing the proofs of the service of a copy
of the writ of possession as well as of the decision of the lower court to the <span class="SpellE">Tolenti­nos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1969</st1:date>, the lower court
denied the Motion to Quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for
reconsideration was likewise denied by the lower court on <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1970</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed before the res­pondent Court of
Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari</i> (CA-G.R. <span style="">No. SP-46321) against the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>,
wherein the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> raised the propriety of the
issuance of the Writ of Possession alleging that it was issued improvidently
because the decision of the lower court declaring them in default was not
served </span>upon them and, therefore, the judgment has not become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
petition was denied by the respondent court in a decision rendered on <st1:date year="1971" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1971</st1:date> on the ground that
the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> were actually and duly served with a
copy of the questioned decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1973</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an Order denying for lack of merit the petition for relief
from judgment filed therein by the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise denied a motion for re­consideration
filed subsequently by the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> in its Order of <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
appealed to the respondent Court of Appeals the above 2 Orders of the lower
court, docketed therein as CA-G.R. No. 54004-R, claiming that the lower court
erred and abused its discretion in not lifting its Order of default and in not
ordering resumption of trial for the reception of their evidence; and, in finally
ordering execution of the default judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="3">March
 2, 1970</st1:date>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> went to see Mr. Ramon Lopez, Branch Manager of
BPI <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Branch, carrying a letter of even date,
offering to redeem the homestead property for P16<span class="GramE">,000</span>
covered by a check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed
that she can no longer redeem the same for the reason that it was already
conveyed to the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> pursuant to the decision
dated March 27, 1969, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> left the office of the
manager, bringing with her the letter which she later on sent to Mr. Lopez by
registered mail, <span class="SpellE">inclosed</span> <span style="">in another letter dated March 3, 1970, reiterating her desire to redeem
the homestead land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Lopez sent said
letters to the <span class="SpellE">BPI's</span> legal counsel with specific
request to inform the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> that they can still
redeem the two other properties covered by T.C.T. Nos. 11085 and 11626 before
the expiration of the redemption period upon payment of the amount of P75<span class="GramE">,995.07</span> - the balance remaining after deducting the amount
of P16,000 paid by the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> for the homestead
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of complying
with <span class="SpellE">BPI's</span> advice, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
con­signed with the Office of the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
a crossed PNB check for P91<span class="GramE">,995.07</span> drawn against the
PNB <span class="SpellE">Kidapawan</span> Branch, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="3"><span style="">March 31, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">,
allegedly for the redemption of the 3 lots, including the homestead land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, however, upon advice of
their counsel, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> issued a stop-payment order
against the said crossed check purportedly to protect her rights and to prevent
</span>BPI <span style="">cashing said check with­out
returning all the properties which </span>BPI <span style="">had foreclosed and purchased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Simultaneously with the

T.C.T. Nos. 11135, 11085 and 11626, which were foreclosed by and sold to BPI,
with a prayer for damages, imputing bad faith on </span>BPI <span style="">in allegedly refusing to allow them to redeem
all three lots and praying that </span>BPI <span style="">be ordered to allow the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> to re­deem
their properties, to accept the payment consigned by them with the City
Sheriff's Office of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, and to </span><span style="">pay </span><span style="">moral and exemplary damages in the sum of P95,000 plus attorney's fees
and costs of suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BPI seasonably filed
an answer with counter­claim, denying the material averments of the complaint,
the truth being that the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> did not have an
intention to redeem their said properties but only the homestead land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BPI counterclaimed for exemplary damages in
the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> and attorney's fees in the sum of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="4"><span style="">April

consolidation of the two appealed cases, CA-G.R. Nos. 53907-R (Civil Case No.

resolved, after considering the comment of the BPI and the opposition of the De

While "default orders are judicially frowned upon, <span class="SpellE">Quirante</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Verano</span> (L-30207, February 27, 1971, 37 SCRA 801)
explicitly admonishes that such 'is true only in meritor­ious cases, that is,
where the failure to file answer on time was due to fraud, accident, mistake,
or excusable negligence and when the existence of a good and substantial
defense has been shown.' No showing was made in the case at bar, that the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>' failure to file their answer on time was due to
any of these grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention and

The Court of Appeals ruled further that "compounding the <span style="">errors, </span>is the failure of the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> and/or their counsel to appear on <span style="">January 12, 1968, the date set for hearing of
their petition for relief, the reason given by counsel that he was out-of-town

meritorious defense relied by the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
consisting of the alleged ex­piration of the five-year period for the
repurchase of the homestead lot under Commonwealth Act No. 141 is clearly
belied by the records of the case which show that the offer to repur­chase the
homestead land made by the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span> was well
within the 5-year period required by law; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>'

not well-taken because this issue has already been settled in CA-G.R. No.
SP-46321 rendered on November 15, 1971, where it was found, after an

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u>In</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Redemption</u> <u>Case</u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in dismissing the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>'
appeal, the respondent court reasoned that although there is no quarrel that
the <span class="SpellE">To­lentinos</span> had 12 months within which to redeem
the properties sold at the Sheriff's sale counted from the time it was regis­tered
on April 2, 1969, the problem, however, lies in the manner of the tender of
payment made by them, granting they made one, "since consignation by
crossed check does not satisfy the requirements set forth in Article 1249 of
the New Civil Code governing the payment of debts in money, which 'shall be
made <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>currency</u> <u>stipulated</u>, and if it is not
possible to deli­ver such currency, then <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>currency</u> <u>which</u>
<u>is</u> <u>legal</u> <u>tender</u> in the Philippines.' Admittedly, a check,
even if good when offered, does not satisfy the requirements of a legal tender,
and for that very reason, BPI was not legally bound to accept such tender of
payment." Hence, no error was committed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in dismissing the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>' complaint for re­demption
with damages.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in dismissing <span class="SpellE">BPI's</span>
appeal, the respondent Court stated that "no bad faith should be
attributed to the <span class="SpellE">Tolen­tinos</span> for filing the instant
case for redemption, in the ab­sence of a proven motive to harass the BPI
considering that in so filing these cases, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
acted in the belief that they are exercising certain rights under the law, and
considering further that they, too, had to spend in prosecut­ing their claims,
no matter how unfounded they may have proven to be."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 24, 1978, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> filed a Motion for Reconsideration</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in the Court of Appeals of the decision
rendered in CA-G.R. No. 53907-R on the ground that "the right </span>to
redeem is not an obligation or debt but rather a privilege, hence, the
provisions of Article 1249 N.C.C. governing payment of debts in money" do
not apply in this case; and, of the de­cision rendered in CA-G.R. No. 54004-R
on the ground that the respondent court erred in not considering that the trial
court abused its discretion in declaring the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
in default, and that the period within which the De la <span class="SpellE">Cruzes</span>
can repur­chase the homestead land had already expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Motion for Reconsideration was denied by
the respondent court for lack of merit in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition for review from the forego­ing
consolidated Decision and Resolution raising the following issues:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT ARTICLE 1249 OF THE NEW
CIVIL CODE APPLIES IN THE CASE AT BAR;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE TENDER OF PAYMENT AND
CONSIGNATION MADE BY THE TOLENTINOS BEFORE THE CITY SHERIFF OF <st1:city><st1:place>DAVAO</st1:place></st1:city>
WERE VALID; and</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT AGAINST THE
TOLENTINOS IN CIVIL CASE NO. 5432 (CA-G.R. No. 54004-R) HAS BECOME FINAL AND
EXECUTORY.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is worthwhile to remember that Article 1249 of the new Civil
Code deals with a mode of extinction of an obligation and expressly provides
for the medium in the "payment of debts." Thus, it provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"The payment of debts in money shall be made in the currency
stipulated, and if it is not possible to deliver such currency, then in the
currency which is legal tender in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The delivery of promissory notes payable to order, or bills
of exchange or other mercantile documents shall produce the effect of payment
only when they have been cashed, or when through the fault of the creditor they
have been impaired.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, the action derived from the original
obligation shall be held in abeyance."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are of the considered view that the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
Article should not be applied in the instant case, hereinafter explained,
together with the exposition on the resolution of the second issue raised in
this petition, the first two issues raised hing­ing ultimately on whether the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> may redeem the pro­perties in suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> are not
indebted to BPI their mortgage indebtedness having been extinguished with the
foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After said <span style="">foreclosure and sale, what remains is the right vested by law in favor
of the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> to redeem the properties within the
prescribed period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right of
redemption is an absolute privilege, the exercise of which is entirely
dependent upon the will and discretion of the <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, thus, no legal obligation to
exercise the right of redemption.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Said right, can in no sense, be considered
an obligation, for the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> are under no
compulsion to exercise the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should
they choose not to exercise it, nobody can compel them to do so nor will such </span><span style="">choice </span><span style="">give rise to a cause of action in favor of the purchaser at the auction
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the rela­tionship between
said purchaser and the <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span> is not even that
of creditor and debtor.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, if the <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span>
choose to exer­cise their right of redemption, it is the policy of the law to
aid rather than to defeat the right of redemption.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It stands to reason therefore, that redemptions should be looked upon with
favor and where no injury is to <span class="GramE">follow,</span> a liberal
construction will be given to our redemption laws as well as to the exercise of
the right of redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant
case, the ends of justice would be better served by affording the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span> the opportunity to redeem the properties in
question other than the homestead land, in line with the policy aforesaid, to
which <span class="GramE">We</span> adhere fully notwithstanding the reason
advanced by the Court of Appeals in its Resolution, denying a reconsideration
of its decision, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"We agree that the act of redeeming of a property mortgaged is
not an obligation but a privilege, in the sense that the mortgagor may or may
not redeem his pro­perty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That of course
is a privilege.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may choose to give up
the property and have the mortgage foreclosed, or redeem the property with the
obligation of course to pay the loan or indebtedness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But where he elects to redeem the property
and he has to pay the loan for which the mortgage was constituted, then Art.
1249 of the Civil Code applies because it involves now the 'payment of debts.'
It is only the act of redeeming or not that is considered a privilege, but not
the act of paying the obligation once the mortgagor has elected to redeem the
property, in which case the check issued or drawn shall produce the effect of
payment only when it has been cashed."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under existing jurisprudence, what the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>
should pay, is not the amount of the "loan for which the mort­gage was
constituted" as stated by the Court of Appeals, but the auction purchase
price plus 1% interest per month on the said amount up to the time of
redemption, together with the <span style="">taxes or
assessment paid by the purchaser after the purchase, if any.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And in this connection, a formal offer to
redeem, accompanied by a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> tender of the redemption
price, although proper, is not essential where, as in the instant case, the
right to redeem is exercised thru the filing of ju­dicial action, which as
noted earlier was made simultaneously with the deposit of the redemption price
with the Sheriff, within the period of redemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The formal offer to redeem, accompanied by a <u>bona</u>
<u>fide</u> tender of the redemption price within the period of redemption prescribed
by law, is only essential to preserve the right of redemption for future en­forcement
even beyond such period of redemption.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The filing of the action itself, within the period of redemption, is
equivalent to a formal offer to redeem.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Should the court allow redemption, the <span class="SpellE">redemptioners</span> should then pay the amount al­ready adverted
to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, when the action
to redeem was filed, a simul­taneous deposit of the redemption money was
tendered to the Sheriff and under the last sentence of Section 31, Rule 39 of
the Rules of <span class="GramE">Court,</span> it is expressly provided that the
tender of the redemption money may be made to the Sheriff who made the sale.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> And the redemption is not rendered invalid
by the fact that the said officer accepted a check for the amount necessary to
make the redemption instead of requiring payment in money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It goes without saying that if he had seen
fit to do so, the officer could have required payment to be made in law­ful
money, and he undoubtedly, in accepting a check, placed himself in a position
where he could be liable to the purchaser at the public auction if any damage
had been suffered by the latter as a result of the medium in which payment was
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this cannot affect the
validity of the payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The check as a
medium of payment in commercial transactions is too firmly es­tablished by
usage to permit of any doubt upon this point at the present day.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> No importance may thus be attached to the
circumstance that a stop-pa</span>y<span style="">ment
order was issued against said check the day following the deposit, for the same
will not militate against the right of the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
to redeem, in the same manner that a withdrawal of the redemption money being
deposited cannot be deemed to have forfeited the right to re­deem, such
redemption being optional and not compulsory.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Withal, it is not clearly shown that said
stop-payment order was made in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But while we uphold the right of redempt­ion of the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>,
the same does not apply to the homestead land, for the reason that shall be
indicated in the discussion of the third issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is a matter beyond
dispute that <span class="GramE">We</span> can review deci­sions of the Court of
Appeals only on errors of law, its find­ings of fact being generally
conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BPI argued that the </span>default
judgment in Civil Case No. 5432 (CA-G.R. No. 54004-R) had already become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; that the lower court found, after an
investigation was conducted on the matter, that petitioners were duly served
with the default judgment; that this finding was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals in CA­-G.R. No. SP-46321 rendered on November 15, 1971, which decision
had already been final and, therefore, the question of whether or not
petitioners were duly served with a copy of said judg­ment should now be
considered closed, said question being factual.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As may be expected, the <span class="SpellE">Tolentinos</span>
maintain that said question is one of law; that they did not in fact receive a
copy of the default judgment; and that the only reason for the finding of the
lower court that there was a valid service of default judgment was the sole
testimony of <span class="SpellE">BPI's</span> counsel, who cannot even recall
the date when the alleged service was made, and there is no evidence as to the
mode of such service.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving their diametrically opposed propositions, it should
be remembered that for a question to be one of law, it must involve no
examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the litigants
or any of them.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The query here presented, necessarily invites calibration of the evidence to
determine whether or not there was really such service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, the question must be deemed to be
factual in character and content, and as correctly pointed out by <span class="GramE">BPI,</span> the jurisprudence on the matter is that findings of
facts of the lower court are accorded the highest degree of respect.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not the function of this Court to analyze or weight the evi­dence all
over again, its jurisdiction being limited to review­ing errors of law that
might have been committed by the lower court.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">And as already intimated earlier, appreciation of evi­dence is
within the domain of the respondent Court of Appeals because its findings of
facts, as a general rule, are not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by the
Supreme Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
This has been the oft-repeated and well-established rule which has been
reiterated in a long line of cases enumerated in Chan v. Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>

this case, to justify a departure from the said rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, the petitioners not having
appealed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, the decision had already attained
the character of finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question
of service cannot now be reopened or raised again in <span class="GramE">this proceedings</span>
