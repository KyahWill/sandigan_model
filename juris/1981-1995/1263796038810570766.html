<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alinsugay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Purita</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, Paz <span class="SpellE">Gandiongco</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> were appointed 
laborers in various offices of the provincial government of 
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span>Cebu</span></span></st1:place><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>After the 
then governor, Rene <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>, had signed their 
appointments, the same were submitted to the local office of the Civil Service 
Commission for attestation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> provincial auditor advised the provincial treasurer 
that the appointments of the four petitioners and forty-four <span class="GramE">others</span> whose positions belonged to the unclassified civil 
service, should be approved by the provincial board pursuant to Section 2081 of 
the Administrative Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 528, otherwise, their 
salaries would not be allowed in audit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 
7).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The provincial treasurer then indorsed the provincial 
auditor's advice to the governor.<span>&nbsp; </span>He also sent a letter to the 
provincial </span>board requesting "approval or disapproval" of the appointments 
of the <span>forty-eight laborers (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">RR &amp; <span>8).</span></span></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Said letter was one of the matters discussed in the provincial 
board's regular session.<span>&nbsp; </span>The minutes of that session reveal that 
the provincial vice-governor and the two present board members <span style="font-style: italic;">exp</span><em>ressed the opinion</em> that they were 
for the approval of the appointments while the governor stated that he wanted to 
"abstain" (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">UU &amp; 
VV).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the governor received a communication from the Civil 
Service Commission advising him that all appointments in the unclassified or 
non-competitive positions in the provincial service including that of the 
provincial board secretary, must be approved by the provincial board to be valid 
and effective.<span>&nbsp; </span>The governor was therefore constrained to submit 
the appointments to the provincial board (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>., 
September 28, 1972, p. 16).<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the action on the 
appointments was delayed because the provincial board did not meet as the <span class="GramE">governor</span> was more concerned with the coming local elections 
(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>., <em>supra</em>, p. 21).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>After the elections, the governor decided to submit the 
appointments of the forty-eight laborers to the new provincial board.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Some of the appointments were approved but others, including those of the 
petitioners, were disapproved (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 10 to 
13-A).<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners sought the governor's reconsideration of the 
provincial board's resolution but the same was denied.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alinsugay</span> and his co-petitioners herein 
then filed a petition for <i>mandamus</i> and damages against the governor, the 
vice-governor, <span class="GramE">the</span> members of the provincial board, the 
provincial treasurer and the provincial auditor.<span>&nbsp; </span>They prayed that 
the respondents be ordered to "continue all petitioners in their employment", to 
include them in the provincial <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> or any 
supplemental budget, and to appropriate the necessary funds to cover all the 
salaries due them.<span>&nbsp; </span>They also prayed that the members of the 
provincial board be ordered to pay jointly and severally each of the petitioners 
P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> as moral damages and P2,000 as attorney's fees 
plus exemplary, actual and consequential damages (Record in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-11016, pp. 4 &amp; 5).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">In its decision, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> dismissed the petition for lack of merit.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It ruled that, to be complete and valid, the appointments should have 
been made in accordance with Section 2081 of the Revised Administrative Code 
which provides that appointments in the unclassified civil service should be 
submitted to and approved by the provincial board.<span>&nbsp; </span>It also held 
that the approval of the provincial budget and <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span> by the provincial board did not mean the approval 
of the appointments; that the appointments were not completed through their 
attestation by the Civil Service Commission; that the provincial board's 
disapproval of their appointments was lawful; and that mere acquisition of a 
civil service eligibility by the petitioners did not make their status permanent 
(CFI Decision, pp. 44-49; Record, pp. 624-629).</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the 
lower court's decision.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their motion for reconsideration having 
been denied, petitioners filed the instant petition for review on 
<i>certiorari</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They submit to this Court the issues of:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(a) whether or not they could still be dismissed as laborers 
notwithstanding the approval of their appointments by the Civil Service 
Commission and their having collected salaries under audited payrolls, and (b) 
whether or not private respondents are liable for moral damages for the alleged 
illegal dismissal of the petitioners (Petition, pp. 4-5; <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 16-17).</p>
<p class="BODY">We gave due course to the petition.<span>&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, 
the petitioners filed an urgent <em>ex-parte</em> motion praying for the 
consolidation of this case with G.R. No. <span>L-47472, </span><em>Valentino 
Taboy, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.</em><u>,</u> on the ground that "the 
facts involved, issues raised and laws applicable in the instant case are 
<span>the same or similar" to those in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-47472 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 113).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The 
</span>motion for consolidation was granted in the resolution of September 24, 
1979 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 121).</p>
<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding that resolution, on July 24, 1981, a decision was 
promulgated in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-47472 (105 SCRA 758).</span><span>&nbsp; 
</span>In said case and in affirming the Court of Appeals' decision, this Court 
ruled that "it matters not that the appointments of the petitioners had been 
attested by the Commissioner of Civil Service and that they had served for 
several years because the appointments having been made without the approval of 
the Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, they were not valid 
appointments" (<em>idem</em>, on page 761).</p>
<p class="BODY">There is no compelling reason to depart from that ruling most 
especially because the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case and this case 
arose from the same factual milieu.<span>&nbsp; </span>We should also add that the 
private respondents, who, as members of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 
provincial board, disapproved the petitioners' appointments, may not be held 
liable for such act.<span>&nbsp; </span>As correctly observed by the lower court, by 
force of logic, the power and authority conferred by law on a body to approve 
appointments, carries with it the corresponding power to disapprove.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In the absence of proof of malice on the part of private respondents, 
they cannot be held liable for their official act.</p>
<p class="BODY">We also share the view of the Court of Appeals that there is no 
reason to perpetuate or continue the mistake, if there was, in the payment of 
salaries of the petitioners (CA Decision, p. 12; <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 46), considering that petitioners do not 
have a legal right over their positions.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby 
affirmed.<span>&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE"><strong>SO 
ORDERED</strong>.</span></p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, (Chairman), Gutierrez, Jr., <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Bidin</span>, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Cortes, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span>
