P12,000 to the heirs of the victim, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>,
plus the costs of the suit (Criminal Case No. 1118).</p>

<p class="BODY">As gathered by the prosecution, the facts of the case are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Jesus <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> was the administrator of
the 28-hectare land located along the seashore of <span class="SpellE">Malolong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, belonging to his aunt, Maria <span class="SpellE">Perdices</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He lived
in nearby <span class="SpellE">Loquilos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manukan</span>,
also in <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was engaged in fishing ("<span class="SpellE">sen­soro</span>") as was <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>, who used to stay in <span class="SpellE">Perdices</span>'
land before he was driven out of it for failure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to pay rentals (TSN, November 14, 1974, pp. 25-26; August 23, 1974, pp.
4-5).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The stiff business competition between <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> developed into something akin to bad blood
between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One time, <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> tried to borrow fif­teen empty fish boxes from <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> but the latter re­fused to lend him any.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On another occasion, <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>
asked <span class="SpellE">Gandola's</span> father, Angel, to admonish <span class="SpellE">Etot</span> (<span class="SpellE">Gan­dola's</span> nickname) not to
spread the rumor that <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> had stolen a cow (TSN, <u>supra</u>,
p. 26).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, there was a time when <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> fired his rifle at <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>
whom he caught disturbing with a fish net the school of fish which had been
spotted by <span class="SpellE">Gandola's</span> fisherman (TSN, August 23, 1974,
pp. 11-12).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sometime in May, 1967,
Pastor <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span>, who took charge of <span class="SpellE">Jusep's</span> fishing business, went to <span class="SpellE">Hilongos</span>,
</span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Leyte</span></span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> under the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

fishing laborers or "<span class="SpellE">buseros</span>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually, he was on an errand for <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> to look for a hit man to do away with <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pastor contacted
his cousin, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span>, and brought him to <span class="SpellE">Manukan</span> where Alfredo met <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>
for the first time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter went with
Pastor to <span class="SpellE">Manukan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">When Pastor introduced
them to each other, <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> asked Alfredo if he was the
same person that Pastor had told him about and Alfredo replied that he was
indeed the one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>
then told Alfredo to shoot <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> in consideration
of the amount of P</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">2,000.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">He
promised to give Alfredo said amount after he had shot <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>
(TSN, August 15, 1974, pp. 14, 28 &amp; 32).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Jusep</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and Alfredo frequently talked to one another
because the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> house was very near that of
Pastor where Alfredo stayed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
Alfredo asked <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> where he would meet <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> answered that he
should go to that part of <span class="SpellE">Manukan</span> where there was a
big house and he would not miss <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> who was a big
fellow (TSN, </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">p. 15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first time Alfredo
saw <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> was when they were on the seashore and <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> pointed out <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> who was
then standing </span>on a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bamboo
raft.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second time was </span>when <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> made him ride a jeep which passed by <span class="SpellE">Gandola's</span> house (TSN, <u>supra</u>, pp. 57-58).</p>

<p class="BODY">When Alfredo asked for a gun, <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>
told him to wait awhile because the .45 caliber gun had not yet arrived (TSN, <u>supra</u>,
p. 16).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the morning of <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1967</st1:date>, while Alfredo was in
the kitchen of Pastor's house, <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He presented Alfredo with a .32 caliber
revolver and told him to use it in shooting <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> said,
"You always tack that revolver on your waist because there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">will </span>be a movie in the afternoon and that
fellow might come and you finish him ('<span class="SpellE">butangi</span>')
there" (TSN, <u>supra</u>, p. 17).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, as instructed by <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>, Alfredo did not
leave Pastor's house that afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> came back, he informed Alfredo that
<span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> was not watching the movie.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, he told Alfredo, "You better go to
his house because he is not around" (TSN, <u>supra</u>, p. 18).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> and Alfredo then hiked along the
sea­shore to the house of <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived there, they stayed by the
coconut tree near the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They waited
for people to come out of the house as it was then <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">time </span>for cooking supper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When they noticed that the people in the house were about to take
supper, <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> directed Alfredo to go under the house
while he stayed a little distance <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> (TSN, <u>supra</u>,
pp. 19-23).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The floor of <span class="SpellE">Gandola's</span> house was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">2½ </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to 3 feet from the
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo went to that part of the
ground underneath the house just below where <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>
was seated eating his supper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could
easily see the persons inside the house because the floor was made of bamboo
slats placed one-fourth of an inch apart (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E;
Record, p. 164; TSN, </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>, his wife <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span>, two of their three children, a baby-sitter and
some "<span class="SpellE">buseros</span>" were taking their
supper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>
was seated at one end of a bench beside his daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unexpectedly, they heard an explosion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> stood up,
looked towards the national road and then towards the sea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, he held his side and said,
"Gin, I was shot" (TSN, August 23, 1974, p. 7).</p>

<p class="BODY">Alfredo shot <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> by holding the gun
perpendicularly and aiming at the left side of <span class="SpellE">Gan­dola's</span>
abdomen just below his ribs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having hit
his mark at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the first shot, </span>Alfredo
aimed for another shot but due to the smoke emitted by the gun after the blast,
he got out from under <span class="SpellE">Gandola's</span> house, went to where <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> was, and together they proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Jusep's</span> house (TSN, August 15, 1974, pp. 24-25).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After learning that <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> had been shot, one of the "<span class="SpellE">buseros</span>"
tried to put out the light </span>from the <span class="SpellE">Petromax</span>
lamp but <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> quickly pumped air into the lamp to
brighten the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing her husband
wounded, she took <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">a </span>flashlight
and went down the house hoping that she could still <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">see </span>the assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
she saw nobody downstairs, she went up the house and saw her husband leaning on
the bench.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>
told her to inform his father about the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> acquiesced
and hurried towards <span class="SpellE">Linay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manukan</span>
to her father-in-law's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Along the
way, she met someone to whom she entrusted the task of informing <span class="SpellE">Gandola's</span> father about the shooting incident (TSN, August
23, 1974, pp. 7-8).</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> returned to their house, <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> told her to inform his father that it was <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> who had
"looked for" his killer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As </span>he spoke, <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>
acted as if nothing had happened to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He then asked <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> to hail a vehicle so
that he could be brought to a hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He repeated his instruction to <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> to
tell his father that it was <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> who had looked for a person to kill him (TSN, supra,
p. 8).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> waited for a vehicle to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">pass </span>by but none came.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, the person she had told to go to her
father-in-law arrived <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>a jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the way to

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>
once more told <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> that <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> was the one who had looked for his killer and
that, should he be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unlucky and die, <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> should take over their fishing business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When they arrived at the hospital at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> that evening, <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>
was x-rayed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While he was being wheeled
to the operating room, <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> reiterated to <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> that it was <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> who had looked for his killer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span> stayed
outside the operating room while her husband was being operated on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00
 o'clock</st1:time> the following morning, she was informed that <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> was dead (TSN, <u>supra</u>, p. 9).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>, who was 36 years old at the
time of his death, underwent an exploratory <span class="SpellE">laparotomy</span>
with <span class="SpellE">gastrorraphy</span> and <span class="SpellE">splenectomy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bullet which entered his left lower
chest, lateral aspect, pene­trated his abdomen and thoracic cavities, perfora­ted
his stomach and lacerated his spleen thus causing massive intra-abdominal
hemorrhage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. M; Record, p. 171).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The immediate cause of his death was severe
anemia due to massive hemorrhage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K; Record, p.
169).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, coming from <span class="SpellE">Gandola's</span>
place, Alfredo and <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> encountered two persons
(TSN, August 15, 1974, p. 25).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of
them, Andres <span class="SpellE">Gundes</span> (<span class="SpellE">Geondres</span>),
was defecating near his house about a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
hundred meters from <span class="SpellE">Gandola's</span> house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He heard the </span>explosion and, shortly
thereafter, saw two men walking towards him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Gundes</span> aimed his flashlight at them and
recognized them as <span class="SpellE">Pidong</span> <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> (TSN,
August 22, 1974, p. 4).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gundes</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">had known <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> for several years and therefore he could not be

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In his </span>brief,
appellant avers that the lower court erred in:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(a) admitting the informa­tion against him without the proper
preliminary investigation; thus, infringing <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arcelita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>, Angel <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> and

discrediting his alibi and the oral and documentary evidence in support thereof;

on him the death penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's allegation of deprivation of due process of law
resulting from the filing of the information without a proper preliminary
investigation is baseless.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to his allegation, the record shows that Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Balisado</span> did in fact conduct a preliminary
investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although on the basis of
said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">preliminary investigation, </span>he
recommended the dismissal of the charge against appellant, his dismissal
resolution was reversed by the Department of Justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Strictly speaking, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">no </span>appeal
was interposed from said dismissal resolution as the case was re­ferred to the
Department of Justice even before <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">said
resolution was issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, when the
Secretary of Justice later reversed the dismissal resolution, he exercised his
power "to alter, modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer
had done in the performance of his duties and substitute the judgment of the
former for that of the latter" (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. </span>de <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Jacob vs. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, G.

1975, 67 SCRA 47).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another preliminary
investigation would have been superfluous because the Secretary of Justice
based his order to file the information on his review of the evidence presented
during the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">preliminary investigation
conducted by Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Bali<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">sado</span></span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, it should be noted that under the 1985 Rules on
Criminal Procedure, in cases where the Minister (now Secretary) of Justice
reverses the resolution of the provincial or city fiscal or chief state prosecutor,
"he shall direct the fiscal concerned to file the corresponding
information <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">with</span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">out conducting another </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">preliminary </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in</span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

or to dismiss or move for dismissal of the complaint or information"
(Section 4, Rule 112).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the merits of the
case, We are convinced that the prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt

executed those statements because he was afraid that the NBI agents </span>would
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">manhandle him </span>is entirely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">untrue as he himself admitted that physical

</span>In fact, he tried to correct the damage his sworn state­ments had done
to his avowed friend, <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>, by <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">pre</span>senting the story that he was
Alfredo's co-author of the crime and that it was he </span>who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accompanied Alfredo when the latter performed
the dastardly act, forgetting all the while that in two of his sworn
statements, he had stated that he was in the market selling fish when <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> was murdered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We hold that the
testimony of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span> alone is sufficient to
prove appellant's direct involvement in the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Arce­lita</span>
and Angel <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span> merely fortify the fact that it was
appellant's idea to liquidate <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>, and the
testimonies of the other witnesses, especially those regarding appellant's
presence at the scene of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">crime
prove beyond reasonable doubt that appellant is as guilty as the convicted <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span> cousins for the murder of <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The credibility of
triggerman Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span> as </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">witness has remained intact notwith­standing
the attempts of the defense to demolish it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Concededly, the testimony of a co-conspirator or a co-accused should be
treated with caution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the same
may be admitted and considered should there be no convincing proof that his
credi­bility is impaired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In this case, the defense
failed to show any reason why Alfredo's testimony should not be given weight
and credence. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>What it considered as a
taint to his credibility is the fact that it took him more than two years to
reveal the com­plicity of appellant in the murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the delay is not without an explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">During the trial of
Criminal Case No. 4826, Alfredo and Pastor were both defended by a counsel
provided by appellant (TSN, August 15, 1974, pp. 37-38).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">It
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was but natural that said

14.0pt">that during cross-examination, they might implicate their benefactor,
appellant herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, until the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">information </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">for murder was filed against <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>, there w</span>as
no occasion for Alfredo to appear in court to tell the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Coupled with that
is the fact that even after his conviction, Alfredo was still entertaining the
hope that <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> would make good his promise to give
him P2,000<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>That hope dis­suaded him from
implicating <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span> in his sworn state­ment before the
NBI agents (TSN, supra, pp. 49-50, 63).</p>

<p class="BODY">In said sworn statement, Alfredo allegedly admitted that he was alone
when he shot <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant now contends that said sworn statement was
"suppressed" by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This contention is unfounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said sworn statement was an exhibit in Criminal Case No. 4826 the record
of which had been lost (TSN, <u>s</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">upra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span>pp. 5-6; Record, pp. 16 &amp;
116).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the appellant was really
convinced that it was vital to his defense, then he should have exerted extra
efforts in procuring it so that it could be presented in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's professed non-involvement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">in </span>the crime is belied by his frequent visits to the <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span> cousins while they were detained in the provincial
jail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the warden, appellant
was particularly interested in the actual date of the <span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span>’
transfer to the San Ramon Penal Colony as he wanted to give them money or
"<span class="SpellE">pabalon</span>" (TSN, November 14, 1974, p.

affidavit claiming sole authorship of the murder and ownership of the fatal
weapon (TSN, August 15, 1974, pp. 40-41; July 18, 1975, pp. 48-49; September 4,

appellant could have returned to <span class="SpellE">Manukan</span> to oversee
the execution of his devious plan to kill <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>, is
not remote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As observed by the trial
court, considering that the distance between <span class="SpellE">Manukan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City is only 38 kilometers and that
between the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> peninsula and <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City it takes only three to four hours ride on a <span class="SpellE">pumpboat</span>, it is not impossible </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

in his sworn statement, stated that before <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00

 1, 1967</st1:date>, he met Alfredo and the appellant along the seashore of <span class="SpellE">Manukan</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His re­fusal on the witness stand to identify
the person he saw running on the seashore with <span class="SpellE">Pidong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cotillas</span> is explained by his own admission that
appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>his friend (TSN,

generic aggravating circumstance as treachery is sufficient to qualify the
killing as murder (People vs. Diaz, L-24002, January 21, 1974, 55 SCRA
178).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crime was attended by evident
premeditation because after appellant and the <span class="SpellE">Co­tillas</span>
cousins had planned the manner by which they would kill <span class="SpellE">Gandola</span>,
they allowed a sufficient interval of time to elapse wherein they could have
dispassionately considered the consequences of their act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although Alfredo did not actually receive the P2,000 promised him
by the appellant, the price, promise or reward is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
