at 2:00 p.m. of 22 January 1989 in Playa del Sol, South Poblacion, Naga,
Cebu.  The victim is Ruth Abay Ubas, a
married woman with two children, who is a schizophrenic.  Her husband, Monico Ubas, initiated the
prosecution by filing a sworn complaint for rape with the Municipal Trial Court

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 13 March 1989, after
conducting clarificatory examination and finding sufficient evidence that the
crime charged was probably committed by accused Elmer Canillo, Danilo Canillo,
Alejandro Largo, and thirteen or more others who were not sufficiently

the court granted in its order of 18 January 1990 on the grounds that (1) since
under Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code, the husband of Ruth Ubas could not

made the basis for the filing by the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor of the

<p class="BODY">Complainant Ruth Ubas, who is married to Monico Ubas and with
whom she has two children, suffers from chronic schizophrenia.  She was first admitted at the Department of
Psychiatry of the Southern Islands Medical Center in Cebu City on 2 April
1980.  One Dr. Garot, who attended to
her, found her to be suffering from post partum psychosis.  She had several consultations in the said
Center until 1985.  The records of the
said consultations from 1980 to 1985 revealed that her condition deteriorated from
a previous level of functioning (post partum psychosis) to "schizophrenia,
undifferentiated type, chronic."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> On
13 September 1985, Ruth consulted Dr. Pacita Libi Co, a Doctor of Medicine
specializing in Psychiatry who was then connected with the Chong Hua Hospital
in Cebu City.  Regarding Ruth's
condition, Dr. Libi Co testified:</p>

<blockquote>"The diagnosis of this case was schizophrenia, disorder
paranoid type.  Now, a person who is
suffering from schizophrenia is chronically ill and they are psychotic in the
sense that they don't have the full exercise of their will and also they have
very poor judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Ruth was under her psychiatric care until
28 December 1988, and within that period Ruth underwent a number of
consultations with her.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In May 1989, after the commission of the rape against her, Ruth
again went to the Southern Islands Medical Center for consultations.  This time, Dr. Renato Obra attended to her
and she remained his patient until 20 February 1991.  On the latter date, she was already manageable, attentive, and
cooperative, but not yet completely recovered from her mental illness.  He prescribed anti-psychotic drugs for her.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the morning of 22 January 1989, before Monico Ubas left his
residence at Naalad, Naga, Cebu, for his work at the Atlas Consolidated Mining
and Development Corporation in Toledo City, he entrusted Ruth Ubas to her
cousin and instructed the latter not to leave Ruth alone because of her mental
illness.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
However, after Monico had left, Ruth also left.  She took <span style="">a </span>pedicab
and went to the beach at Playa del Sol, South Poblacion, Naga, Cebu.  Upon her arrival there at around 11:00 a.m.,
she changed into her shorts and blouse, left her bag with an old woman, and
proceeded to wade into the water.  There
she met accused Danilo Canillo, Alejandro Largo, Rogelio Largo, Edgar Aliganga,
Ceferino Llamedo, and others who were members of the Grayrocks basketball team,
and who were celebrating their victory in a tournament.  They befriended her.  Danilo Canillo remarked, "Who is this
beautiful girl with beautiful legs?" She introduced herself to them and
they also introduced themselves.  Then
they told her, "Day, let's have sexual intercourse," to which she
replied in the negative because she is <span style="">"a
</span>married woman." While in the water, Danilo Canillo removed her
shorts and panty.  Then the others
spread her legs and said, "You accede to our request, Day, because we are
Philippine Constabulary and this fellow Andy is our superior officer, he will
be the first to have sexual intercourse with you." She got
frightened.  They got what they
wanted.  Accused Alejandro Largo, Danilo
Canillo, Rogelio Largo, Edgar Aliganga, and Gerry Cañalita had sexual
intercourse with her, one after the other, in that order.  Ceferino Llamedo was at the time
"beside the sea near the tuba placed inside the gallon." Thereafter,
one of the accused suggested that she be given food after which they "will
have another intercourse with her at the place where the <i>roma </i>plants
grow." Alejandro Largo gave her "<i>puso</i>,"<i> </i>"<i>humba</i>,"<i>
</i>and a softdrink.  After she had
eaten and drank, Alejandro Largo and Danilo Canillo escorted her to the place
where there were roma plants.  They were
accompanied by Gerry Cañalita, Mikoy Candol, Cris, Jose Herediano, Arnel
Aliganga, and others.  At that place,
Alejandro Largo took off his shirt and used it as a mat on the sand were she
was made to lie down.  Then he had
sexual intercourse with her.  Danilo
came next and was followed by the others.  Mikoy Candol then inserted his penis into Ruth's mouth and asked her,
"Are you not a prostitute, Day? Are you not inflicted with a transmissible
disease, Day?" Not contented with what they had done, they threw sand on
her private parts.  She took a
bath.  Then she was brought to a place
near the St. Jude Funeral Homes and told that <span style="">if </span>she revealed the incident to anybody she would be
killed.  Afterwards, she was brought to
a hut where accused Alejandro Largo and Danilo Canillo once more had sexual
intercourse with her.  Afterwards, they
gave her P1.00 for her fare home.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At about 11:00 a.m. of 23 January 1989, Ruth was admitted at the Minglanilla
District Hospital in Minglanilla, Cebu, and treated by Dr. Jose Villanueva for
bruises inflicted by her husband.  Upon
being informed that she had been sexually <span style="">assaulted,
Dr. Villanueva also examined her private parts.  He found "whitish material or substance at the entrance of
the vaginal canal" and at the pubic hair,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which </span>was <span style="">found positive for spermatozoa.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> He stated that the presence of this
substance in the vaginal canal meant that there was penetration of </span>a
male <span style="">sexual organ and its quantity, in
solidified form, indicated the possibility that it could have come from more
than one person.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The presentation of Ruth Ubas as a witness for the prosecution
was initially opposed by the defense on the ground that being of unsound mind
as testified to by Dr. Obra and Dr. Libi Co, she was not competent to testify.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court decided, however, to allow the prosecution to ask her
qualifying questions, and upon motion of the defense, to allow the latter to
likewise do the same to determine if she was competent to testify,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
which they did,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
with the exception of the counsel for the accused-appellants who stated that he
was "just waiting if she is qualified or not to testify in court."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
After the qualifying questions were asked by the defense, the court allowed the
prosecution to further ask Ruth about the facts surrounding the commission of
the crime charged, which she described in detail.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court then ruled that Ruth was qualified to testify.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
The attorneys for the accused did not challenge the ruling; instead, each of
them subjected her to rigorous cross­-examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused, corroborated by their witnesses,
presented different versions of the incident of 22 January 1989.  Only those of the accused-appellants need be
considered in this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Rogelio Largo, the younger brother of Alejandro
Largo and a member of the Grayrocks basketball team, testified that their team
was awarded a cash prize when they won a game on 16 January 1989.  On 22 January 1989, he, together with Wennie
Canoy, Rey Navales, Gonnie Largo, Ploy Entice, Edgar Aliganga, Gerry Cañalita,
Jose Herediano, Cris Obenita, Danilo Canillo, Elmer Canillo, Ceferino Llamedo,
and Peter Largo, celebrated in his house located at Poblacion, Naga, Cebu.  They ate fish which was bought with part of
the cash prize.  After eating, his
companions left for the beach.  He did
not go with them but stayed in the house that afternoon.  However, at about 5:00 p.m., he went to
Playa del Sol to buy fish.  Since the
price was somewhat high, he did not buy any and just went home.  He came to know Ruth Ubas and her husband
only when he was detained in jail.  He
cannot think of any reason why he was charged with rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Alejandro Largo asserted that he is not a
member of the Grayrocks basketball team.  He cannot play basketball because he has a broken left leg due to a
vehicular accident in 1981.  While he
was at home in the morning of 22 January 1989, Crisanto Obenita, the leader of
the basketball team, arrived and asked him to buy tuba and deliver it to Playa
del Sol where there would be a celebration of the team's victory in the
tournament.  He delivered the tuba to
Crisanto at the beach <span style="">and </span>there
saw  Rey Navales, Jose Herediano, Edgar
Aliganga, Wennie Canoy, Ploy Entice, Peter Largo, Arnel Aliganga, Richard
Aliganga, Warlito Sayson, Danilo Canillo, Elmer Canillo, Ceferino Llamedo,
Mikoy Candol, and a certain Eugenio.  He
did not see his younger brother Rogelio in the group.  He ate fish at the seashore and thereafter went with Protacio
Sayson to the cockpit where he gambled.  He went home when it was almost dark.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alejandro Largo further testified that he knew Ruth Ubas because
she used to ride in his pedicab, but he did not have sexual intercourse with
her on 22 January 1989.  On that date,
he was nowhere near the St. Jude Funeral Homes and he saw no small hut near
it.  There is a PC detachment ten
fathoms away from the St. Jude Funeral Homes.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first and second assigned errors, the
accused-appellants contend that they never knew Ruth Abay Ubas was insane or
mentally ill and that it was incumbent upon the prosecution to show by clear
and convincing evidence that they knew her to be insane at the time of the
incident and for sometime prior thereto.  Nor was there evidence showing that she had appeared to the public as a
"foolish" woman.  Since they
did not know her to be insane and she knew them to be tricycle drivers, it was
illogical for them to make her believe that they were PC soldiers.  There was, as well, no basis to the
conclusion that they took advantage of her mental condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the third assigned error, the accused-appellants assert
that Ruth did not testify that they were the ones who threatened her with death
if she did not agree to have sexual intercourse with them.  They aver that Ruth testified that the
threat was made by others.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, on the fourth
assigned error, the accused-appellants maintain that the evidence has not
established their guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that the trial court
overlooked vital facts which could have altered its decision had they been
taken into consideration, <i>viz</i>., (1) the uncorroborated testimony of Ruth
Ubas; (2) her smiling several times in the course of her testimony; (3) the
delay in the filing of her sworn complaint which indicated her hesitation to

<blockquote>a) <span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence for the prosecution failed to
establish that they had carnal knowledge of Ruth Ubas;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>c)  Even if there was rape based on carnal
knowledge of a woman who was suffering from mental ailment, and therefore
deprived of reason, no conviction will lie without proof that they knew of such
ailment before and at the time the sexual act <span style="">was </span>done.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Our review of the evidence convinces us with moral certainty that
Ruth Ubas was sexually abused, not while she was in the waters at Playa del Sol
and by all the accused, as claimed by her, which we believe to be improbable,
but at the place where there were <i><span style="">roma
</span></i>plants and then in a hut near the St. Jude Funeral Homes.  At the place where there were <i><span style="">roma </span></i>plants, accused-appellant
Alejandro Largo used his shirt <span style="">as a mat
</span>on which Ruth was made to lie down and was raped by him and then by
Danilo Canillo.  At the hut, Ruth was
again raped by accused-appellants Alejandro Largo and Danilo Canillo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ravishment of Ruth is confirmed by the detection by Dr.
Villanueva of the presence of a whitish substance in Ruth's vaginal canal and
pubic hair, which was positive for spermatozoa and which could have come from
more than one person.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We <span style="">agree, </span>however,
with the contention of the accused-appellants that the evidence is insufficient
to prove force and intimidation.  Ruth's
answers on cross-examinations by the attorneys for the accused disclose that
although she was alone, she swam toward where the accused were, frolicked with
them in the water, enjoyed their company in partaking of <span style="">"<i>puso</i>," "<i>humba</i>,"<i>
</i></span>and a softdrink.  After she
had sexual intercourse with Alejandro Largo and Danilo Canillo at the place
where there were <i><span style="">roma </span></i>plants,
she took a bath again.  Minutes later,
she went with Alejandro and Danilo to a hut near St. Jude Funeral Homes where
they had, once more, sexual intercourse with her.  Then, they gave her P1.00<span style="">
</span>for her fare home which she accepted.  She appeared to have enjoyed these sexual adventures.  When she was confronted by her husband,
Monico, after he was informed by his neighbors and friends that she left the
house, took a bath at the beach, and was ravished by many persons, Ruth denied
having been ravished and refused to disclose the names of her defilers.  As a consequence, Monico put his "wrath
on the body" of Ruth "by hitting her with a chair."<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On this matter then, we disagree with the conclusions of the trial
court that there was intimidation which deprived Ruth of reason.  Obviously, the trial court had mixed up the
first and second paragraphs of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing notwithstanding, on 22 January 1989, Ruth Ubas was
raped for as many times as there were acts of sexual intercourse with her.  She was suffering from a chronic mental
disorder and, therefore, incapable of giving effective consent to sexual
intercourse.  In short, for purposes of
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, she was deprived of reason.  The rationale behind paragraph 2 of Article
335 (when the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious) is that
such a woman has no will.  Such lack of
will may exist not only when the victim is unconscious or totally deprived of
reason, but also when she is suffering from some mental deficiency impairing
her reason or free will.<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a> In <i><span style="">People vs</span></i><span style="">.<i> Manlapaz</i>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>'In this species of rape neither force upon the part of a man nor

incapable of legally consenting, resistance is not expected any more than it is
in the case of one who has been drugged to unconsciousness, or robbed of
judgment by intoxicants.  Nor will an
apparent consent in such a case avail any more than in the case of a child who
may actually consent, but who by law is conclusively held incapable of legal
consent.  Whether the woman possessed
mental capacity sufficient to give legal consent must, saving in exceptional
cases, remain <span style="">a </span>question of fact <span style="">x x </span>x.  It need but be said that legal consent presupposes an intelligence

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, it was convincingly established by the

chronic," until 1985.  When she was
under treatment by Dr. Pacita Libi Co from September 1985 to 28 December 1989,
or three weeks before the incident in question, Ruth was suffering from
"schizophrenia disorder, paranoid type." According to Dr. Libi Co,
persons suffering from schizophrenia are "chronically ill" <span style="">and </span>"psychotic" because

schizophrenia is found under the chapter on <u><span style="">Psychotic</span></u><span style=""> <u>Disorders</u>
</span>and the following discussion thereunder is enlightening:</p>

<blockquote>"Symptomatically, the schizophrenic reactions are recognizable
through odd and bizarre behavior apparent in aloofness, suspiciousness, or
periods of impulsive destructiveness and immature and exaggerated emotionality,
often ambivalently directed and considered inappropriate by the observer.  The interpersonal perceptions are distorted
in the more serious states by delusional and hallucinatory material.  In the most disorganized forms of
schizophrenic living, withdrawal into a fantasy life takes place and is
associated with serious disorder of thought and profound habit deteriorations
in which the usual social customs and personal care are disregarded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is generally considered that the schizophrenic is incapable of
effectively harmonizing his drives and inhibitions through mature adaptations
and defenses.  He has failed to develop
a satisfying concept of his body and a clear or stable self-concept.  He is often unclear in his goals, or his
aspirations are so demanding or inflexible that they exceed his talents,
persistence, and drive to mastery.  Thus
he is deficient in his capacity to assess clearly the realities of the
world.  Interactions with others are characterized
by immature processes of communication, thought, and adaptation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In psychoanalytic terms, the schizophrenics represent those who
have failed, due to either somatic or psychogenic forces, to evolve the ego,
integrative processes or strengths necessary to resolve flexibly conflicts
between their (id) drives and over-demanding super-ego attitudes and
aspirations.  They are thus defective in
the capacity to adapt to the social demands confronting them and to their own
drives and they thereby lack a harmonious self-concept and ego ideal with clear
goals and motivations."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have no doubt that because of her chronic mental or psychotic
disorder, Ruth Ubas was deprived of reason or intelligence so as to render her
legally incapable of consenting to or opposing the carnal acts in
question.  Since she was <u>deprived</u>
<u>of</u> <u>reason</u>, any carnal knowledge of her on 22 January 1989 by any
of the accused-appellants would amount to rape under the second paragraph of
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our analysis and evaluation of the evidence convinces us beyond a
doubt that accused-appellant Alejandro Largo consummated two acts of sexual
intercourse with Ruth Ubas, first, at the place were there were <i>roma </i>plants,
and second, at the hut near the St. Jude Funeral Homes at Playa del Sol, South
Poblacion, Naga, Cebu, on <span style="">22 </span>January
1989.  In both instances, Danilo Canillo
also had sexual intercourse with her.  We are also convinced that there was conspiracy between
accused-appellant Alejandro Largo and Danilo Canillo.  They escorted her to the venue of the first encounter and then
brought her to the nipa hut for the second.  In both instances, they, one after the other and in the presence of each
other, sexually assaulted her.  Evidently, they had a common bestial and ignoble purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is conspiracy when two or more persons come to an agreement
concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a>
Conspiracy to exist does not require an agreement for an appreciable period
prior to the commission of the crime.  From a legal standpoint, there is conspiracy if at the time of the commission
of the offense the accused had the same purpose and were united in its
execution.<a style="" href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup></span></span></a>
Direct proof of previous agreement to commit a crime is not necessary.  It may be deduced from the mode and manner
in which the offense was perpetrated, or inferred from the acts of the accused
themselves when such acts point to a joint purpose and design, concerted
action, and community of intent.<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a>
Conspiracy in this case having been established insofar as accused-appellant
Alejandro Largo is concerned, the act of one co-conspirator is the act of the
other co-conspirator.<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a> In
short, Alejandro Largo is a principal in the two rapes he directly committed
and a co-principal in each of the two rapes directly committed by Danilo
Canillo.  Fortunately for him, however, the
amended complaint charges him and the others with the crime of rape in only
"three (3) counts," and per the prosecution's evidence, Alejandro had
carnal knowledge of Ruth, first, at the waters of Playa del Sol; second, at the
place with <i><span style="">roma </span></i>plants;
and, third, at the hut near the St. Jude Funeral Homes.  In short, although the amended complaint
speaks of conspiracy among the accused, only three rapes were charged and the
evidence in support of these was confined to the three rapes committed in the
three places mentioned.  As earlier
observed, however, the commission of the first rape seems improbable.  Accordingly, Alejandro Largo can only be
held liable for the two proven acts of sexual intercourse which he had with
Ruth Ubas.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no sufficient evidence against accused Rogelio
Largo.  His acquittal is thus in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants contend that even if Ruth Ubas were insane
and they had sexual intercourse with her, they cannot be held liable for rape
without proof that they knew beforehand of her insanity.  This contention cannot be upheld.  First, it is belied by Alejandro Largo's
admission on cross-examination that he knew of Ruth Ubas' mental condition.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  And you will agree with me, Mr. Largo, that at the time when you had no
passenger, you would talk about some characters of your passenger such that you
knew that Ruth Ubas is mentally ill, is not that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A  Yes, I learned that
through the neighbors because it was known that Ruth Ubas is mentally defective
(buangon)."<a style="" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Second, we are of the opinion that the
accused's knowledge of the victim's mental condition is not <span style="">an </span>essential element of the crime of
rape under Article 335(2).  Had the
legislature intended that knowledge of the victim's mental condition (or of any
other fact) would be an essential element of rape under Article 335(2), it
would have expressly provided so, <span style="">as </span>it
has so provided with respect to other felonies in the Revised Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></span></span></a>
That the legislature did not do so reveals its intent to dispense with the
element of <i><span style="">scienter </span></i>under
Article 335(2).</p>

<p class="BODY">While there are American cases<a style="" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></span></span></a>
which support the proposition that the <span style="">accused's
</span>knowledge of the victim's mental defect is necessary for conviction, a reading
thereof would reveal that these cases often do so by virtue of a statute so
providing.  On the other hand in <i><span style="">State vs</span></i><span style="">.<i> Meyer</i>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>the court ruled that there are
certain types of statutory crimes in the commission of which the perpetrator
acts at his peril, and that if knowledge is not made a prerequisite by the
statute defining the crime, its absence is not a defense, nor is it an element
to be proved by the State.<a style="" href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing disquisitions, the trial court's
conclusion on Alejandro Largo's guilt must be sustained, but not because, as
earlier discussed, of any threat and intimidation which deprived her of reason,
but because she was suffering from schizophrenia, paranoid type, which deprived
her of reason.  Further, he should be
held liable not just for one but for two rapes.  He succumbed, at least twice, to his bestial i<span style="">nstinct and desire to satisfy his animal lust
by preying upon a married woman with two children who was suffering from a
chronic mental disorder which rendered her incapable of effectively giving
consent to or opposing the carnal acts.  He became a two-legged beast which civilized society must not allow to
roam.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
