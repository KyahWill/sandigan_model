set aside the Court of Appeals' decision dated <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1986</st1:date> in CA-G.R. CV No. 03269 which affirmed
the decision of the trial court in favor of the private respondents in an
action to recover the petitioners' time deposits in the respondent Family
Savings Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since 1980, the petitioner, Victoria <span class="SpellE">Yau</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chu</span>, had been purchasing cement on credit from CAMS
Trading Enterprises, Inc. (hereafter "Cams Trading" for
brevity).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To guaranty payment for her cement
withdrawals, she executed in favor of Cams Trading <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">deeds of assignment of her time deposits in the total sum of P320<span class="GramE">,000</span> in the Family Savings Bank (hereafter the Bank).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except for the serial numbers and the dates
of the time deposit certificates, the deeds of assignment, which were prepared
by her own lawyer, uniformly provided <span class="GramE">-</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

admitting that her outstanding account with Cams Trading was P404<span class="GramE">,500</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After verbally
advising </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Chu</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> of the assignee's request to <span class="SpellE">encash</span> her time deposit certificates and obtaining her
verbal conformity thereto, the Bank agreed to <span class="SpellE">encash</span>
the certificates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It delivered to Cams
Trading the sum of P283<span class="GramE">,737.75</span> only, as one time
deposit certificate (No. 0048120954) lacked the prope</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">r</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
signatures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed of the
encashment, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> demanded from the Bank and Cams
Trading that her time deposit be restored.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When neither complied, she filed a complaint to recover the sum of P283<span class="GramE">,737.75</span> from them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The case was docketed in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
Metro Manila (then CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>
Branch XIX), as Civil Case No. 38861.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We find no merit in the
petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court of Appeals
found that the deeds of assignment were contracts of pledge, but, as the
collateral was also money or an exchange of "peso for peso," the <span class="GramE">provision</span> in Article 2112 of the Civil Code for the sale of
the thing pledged at public auction to convert it into money to satisfy the <span class="SpellE">pledgor's</span> obligation, did not have to be followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All that had to be done to convert the <span class="SpellE">pledgor's</span> time deposit certificates into cash was to
present them to the bank for encashment after due notice to the debtor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The encashment of the
deposit certificates was not a <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>commissorio</u></span> which is prohibited under Art. 2088 of
the Civil Code, A <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>commissorio</u></span>
is a provision for the <u>automatic</u> appropriation of the pledged or
mortgaged property </span>by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
creditor in payment of the loan upon its maturity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prohibition against <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span>
</span><span class="SpellE"><u>commissorio</u></span> is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">intended to protect the </span>obligor, <span class="SpellE">pledgor</span>,
or mortgagor against being overreached by his creditor who holds a pledge or
mortgage over property whose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">value is </span>much
more than the debt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">in </span>this case, the security for the
debt is also money deposited in a bank, the amount of which is even less than
the debt, it was not illegal for the creditor to <span class="SpellE">encash</span>
the time deposit certificates to pay the debtors' overdue obligation, with the
latter's consent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Whether the debt had
already been paid as now alleged by the debtor, is </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">factual question which the Court of Appeals
found not to have been proven for the evidence which the debtor sought to
present on appeal, were receipts for payments made <u>prior to </u></span><st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="7"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July
 18, 1980</span></u></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Since the petitioner signed on <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1980</st1:date> a letter admitting her
indebtedness to be in the sum of P404<span class="GramE">,500</span>, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">there </span>is no proof of payment made by
her thereafter to reduce or extinguish her debt, the application of her time
deposits, which she had assigned to the creditor to secure the payment of her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">debt, was proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals did not commit a
reversible error in holding that it </span>was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
