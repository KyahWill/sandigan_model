contemplation of law (G.R. No. 59880, George Arguelles (<span class="SpellE">Hda</span>.

the petitioners </span>were given their day in court.</p>

that pursuant to the order issued by Judge <span class="SpellE">Suico</span> in
Civil Case No. 9088, they were under legal compulsion to pay directly to China
Bank and that by paying to China Bank, they are deemed to have paid the private
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the petitioners
allege that they </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">have </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">technically complied with the terms of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Such contention is
untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even without a discussion of
whether or not the petitioners were under </span>legal compulsion to pay directly
their rentals to China Bank or that subrogation (Article 1303, Civil Code), as
contended by the petitioners took place by reason of the RTC order, these
defenses would remain unavailing to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The records disclose that
despite the order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Suico</span> directing the
petitioners to pay directly to China Bank, there is no evidence on record that
any rental payments were ever made to the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent judge even summoned the bank manager who testified to
such non-payment in a hearing on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">July 16, </span>1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the very least, it was incumbent upon the
petitioners to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">present receipts </span>that
they have been paying their rents for the use of the barbecue stalls.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the petitioners failed in this
respect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The RTC order by itself is not
a valid excuse nor can it be considered as a valid defense for the petitioners
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">escape liability under the
compromise agreement.<br>
Clearly therefore, there was a breach of the terms of the agreement considering
that no payments were made after </span><st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">December 3, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
