				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review on <i>certiorari</i> the order,
dated <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1978</st1:date>, of
the respondent judge in Civil Case No. 115385, Court of First Instance of
Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, briefly, are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1977</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Transunion</span> Corporation and <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
M. Pan doing business under the name of Pan Phil Trading entered into a
dealership agreement for the sale of merchandise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant thereto Pan Phil Trading had to file
a P20,000 surety bond and it complied by presenting a surety bond of Eastern
Assurance &amp; Surety Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1978</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Transunion</span> filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 115385,
CFI, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>) against <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> M. Pan, Pan Phil Trading and Eastern Assurance &amp;
Surety Corporation for the full payment of merchandise delivered in the amount
of P10<span class="GramE">,841.54</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Eastern Assurance &amp; Surety Corporation had filed its
Answer with <span class="SpellE">Crossclaim</span>, it filed a motion to file a
third-party complaint against <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> B. Pan, wife of <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> M. Pan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason given in the motion is that <span class="SpellE">movant</span> has a legal
right against <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> B. Pan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that in consideration of the
surety bond, the Pan spouses executed an Indemnity Agreement in favor of
Eastern Assurance &amp; Surety Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1978</st1:date>,
the respondent judge granted the motion and admitted the third-party complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> B. Pan filed a
motion to dismiss the third-party complaint on the ground that venue was
improperly laid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She invoked paragraph 7
of the Indemnity Agreement which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WAIVER OF VENUE OF ACTION:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- We [meaning <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
M. Pan and <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> B. Pan] hereby agree that any
question which may arise between the Company and the undersigned by reason of
this document and which has to be submitted to the court of justice, shall be
brought before the court of competent jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, waiving for this purpose any other proper venue."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the opposition of Eastern Assurance &amp; Surety
Corporation, the respondent judge in his order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1978</st1:date>, <span style="">peremptorily dismissed the third-party complaint on the ground that the
motion to dismiss was "well-taken." The respondent judge, may his
tribe vanish, did not elaborate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion to reconsider the order of dismissal was denied in a similar fashion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have to grant the petition despite the comment of the
respondent judge to the petition for review that in dismissing the third-party
complaint he had to uphold the policy of upholding the sanctity of contracts in
preference to the policy against multiplicity of suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even cites Roscoe Pound's Scope and
Purpose of Sociological Jurisprudence in 24 Harvard Law Review 607.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the respondent judge and even petitioner's counsel failed to
perceive is that paragraph 7 of the Indemnity Agreement was imposed on the Pan
spouses by the petitioner surety company for its benefit and convenience and
therefore the latter could waive the provision by filing its complaint, not in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, but in Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is, therefore, no sanctity of contract to uphold.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if we assume that paragraph 7 of the Indemnity Agreement
created a reciprocal obligation, it does not necessarily follow that it is
applicable to the present situation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has to be remembered that a third-party complaint is but
ancillary to the main action and is a procedural device to avoid multiplicity
of suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of its nature the
prescriptions on jurisdiction and venue applicable to ordinary suits may not
apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus a third-party complaint has
to yield to the jurisdiction and venue of <span style="">the
main action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This view is supported by
our decision in Republic vs. Central Surety &amp; Insurance Co., G.R. L-27802,
Oct. 26, </span>1968, <span style="">25 SCRA 641,
where we said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the third issue, the Surety takes the
position that if the trial court acquired jurisdiction over the main case, 'it
follows that it could also take cognizance of the third-party complaint which
derives its life from the complaint.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Surety has a point here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that the third-party complaint was filed after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> date of Republic Act 3828.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise true that the demand therein
made does not exceed P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>, and, therefore, is not
within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance if it were an
independent action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the third-party
complaint is an ancillary suit which depends on the jurisdiction of the court
over the main action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the trial
court had acquired jurisdiction over the complaint, it necessarily follows that
it like<span style="">wise had jurisdiction over the
third-party complaint which is but an incident thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so because jurisdiction over the
main case embraces all incidental matters arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
and connected therewith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary rule
would result in 'split jurisdiction' which is not favored, and in multiplicity
of suits, a situation obnoxious to the orderly administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court acquired jurisdiction over the
third-party complaint, provided it had jurisdiction over the main case, for the
reason that the third-party complaint is but a continuation thereof, its
purpose being to seek 'contribution, indemnity, subrogation or any other
relief, in respect to his opponent's claim.'" <span class="GramE">(At pp.
