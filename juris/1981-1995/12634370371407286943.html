<p class="BODY">The facts as brought out by the evidence for the prosecution are
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">A mobile patrol of Davao Metrodiscom arrested a certain Allan
Amora on the night of March 14, 1992 for illegal possession of marijuana.  After the arrest, the police officers
brought Amora to the Intelligence Division of the Davao Metrodiscom and there
Amora revealed that he bought the marijuana from a certain "Bro."
Hence, a buy-bust team was immediately created to entrap "Bro," the
person alleged to have sold the marijuana to Amora.</p>

<p class="BODY">The buy-bust team was composed of Capt. Zosimo Yu as the leader,
SPO1 Billy Echon, SPO3 Joselito Baradas and SPO3 Marlon Pinute as members.  Amora was designated as the
poseur-buyer.  The team forthwith went
to Bonifacio Extension, the place where the mobile patrol earlier arrested
Amora.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching Bonifacio Extension at 7:45 o'clock P.M., SPO3
Pinute positioned himself about 5 to 7 meters from where Amora and SPO1 Echon
were.  About a minute later, a person
called "Bro," whose real name turned out to be Felimon Petilla III,
appeared.  SPO1 Echon and Amora then
gave P200.00 to "Bro," who told them to wait beside the electric post
nearby.  "Bro" then proceeded
to the interior of Bonifacio Extension where there was a cluster of small
houses.  However, instead of staying
near the electric post SPO1 Echon and Amora went to a store nearby.  At that moment, a certain <i><span style="">alias </span></i>"Boy," herein
accused-appellant, appeared near the store.</p>

<p class="BODY">After 15 minutes, "Bro" returned with a package wrapped
in newspaper.  "Bro" directly
handed the package to accused-appellant who then approached SPO1 Echon and
Amora at the store.  It was at this
point when SPO1 Echon grabbed the hand of accused-appellant and instructed the
other members of the team to pursue "Bro." Unfortunately, "Bro"
ran towards the public market and disappeared in the crowd.</p>

<p class="BODY">Specimen samples from each of the 47 cigarette sticks were
brought to the PNP Crime Laboratory, Davao City for examination.  Forensic Analyst Salome Jose found the
specimens positive for marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant, on the other hand, testified that in the
evening of March 14, 1992, he and <span style="">one
William </span>Gitacay, a boarder at his house located at 234 Bonifacio Street
Extension, went to dispose of garbage in front of the Mabini Public
Market.  On their way home, they were
accosted by policemen who inquired where they came from.  Accused-appellant answered that they went to
throw some garbage.  One of the
policemen held accused-appellant's arm and told him to wait inside the patrol
car.  The policeman then rummaged
through the garbage pile, but did not find anything there.  Accused-appellant and Gitacay were then
brought to the PC barracks where they met Amora for the first time.  Amora was holding a marijuana cigarette stick
wrapped in a piece of paper.  Amora told
the police investigator that accused-appellant was the source of the
marijuana.  The investigator then
brought accused-appellant to a dark room at the back of the Police Headquarters
where he tried to force him (accused-appellant) to admit that he sold marijuana
to Amora.  Accused-appellant denied the
imputation.  However, the policeman
slapped him several times and poked a gun into his mouth.  Despite the threat, accused-appellant
steadfastly denied that he ever sold marijuana to Amora.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gitacay corroborated accused-appellant's testimony.  Gitacay averred that he was a boarder in the
house of accused-appellant; that he and accused-appellant were together at 8:00
o'clock P.M. on March 14, 1992 disposing of some garbage at the Mabini Public
Market, but on their way back, they were apprehended by policemen.  Gitacay also testified that he and the
accused were then brought to Camp Domingo Leonor.  Thereafter, Gitacay was released but the accused-appellant
continued to be detained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant assigns the following as errors of the trial
court:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I.</p>

<blockquote>IN DECLARING THE APPELLANT
GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT FOR VIOLATION OF SEC. 4 ARTICLE II OF THE
DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 1972 AS AMENDED BY B.P. BLG. 179.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no evidence at all that accused-appellant sold,
delivered or otherwise committed an act violative of the Dangerous Drugs Act.  What was only proved by the prosecution was
that the package wrapped in a newspaper was handed by "Bro" to
accused-appellant who, in turn, approached the police officers with the
package.  It was at this juncture that
SPOI Echon grabbed accused-appellant's hand and arrested him.  There is nothing to show that
accused-appellant knew of the contents of the package.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's main argument is that the package wrapped in
a newspaper was only handed to him by his brother and there is no evidence to indicate
that accused-appellant knew of its contents.<i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4, Article II, of R.A. No. 6425, otherwise known as the
Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 4. Sale, Administration, Delivery, Distribution and
Transportation of Prohibited Drugs. - The penalty of life imprisonment to death
and a fine ranging from twenty thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be
imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, administer,
deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any
prohibited drug, or shall act as broker in any such transactions.  If the victim of the offense is a minor, or
should a prohibited drug involved in any offense under this Section be the
proximate cause of the death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein
provided shall be imposed." (as amended by PD No. 1675, February 17, 1980)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 (f) of Article I of the same law defines the word
"deliver", thus:</p>

<blockquote>"(f) 'Deliver'
- refers to a person's act of knowingly passing a dangerous drug to another
personally or otherwise, and by any means, with or without consideration."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case for the prosecution was woven principally from the
testimony of SPO1 Echon.  This witness
declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
while you and Allan Amora were in the nearby store where were the other members
of the team situated?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They were in the dark
area which has a distance of 7 meters from me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.  How many meters were you or how long have you been in the nearby store
before Allan Amora returned. . . I will reform, Your Honor.   How long were you in the nearby store before
alias Bro returned from the cluster of houses?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About 15 minutes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, when Allan Amora
delivered the P200.00 to alias Bro, were there companions of alias Bro?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.  So, at that time when you met alias Bro with Allan Amora at the electric
post along Bonifacio Extension and the P200.00 amount was delivered to alias
Bro by Allan Amora, alias Bro was alone and he was never accompanied by any
other person?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.  You said that it took 15 minutes for alias Bro to return from the time
... to return from the cluster of houses inside Bonifacio Extension, when alias
Bro returned was he accompanied by some persons?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was alone when he
returned and that was the time when you arrested or held the hand of alias Boy?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he arrived he gave
marijuana to Boy and when he went near us I arrested Boy.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>So,
you saw alias Bro holding marijuana and delivering the said marijuana to alias
Boy, is that what you mean?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.  And after you saw that alias Boy was already holding the marijuana which
was handed by alias Bro that was the time you held the hand of alias Boy, is
that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When alias Boy arrived,
where were you and alias Bro went? (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When alias Bro arrived,
alias Boy was there but I do not know him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You mean they arrived at
the store together?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When alias Bro arrived
he handed the stuff to alias Boy and alias Boy went near us and this alias Bro
left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You show the court how
it looked when it was handed over by alias Bro to the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(WITNESS WRAPPING THE MARIJUANA WITH THE
NEWSPAPER AND FOLDING BOTH ENDS OF THE NEWSPAPER)</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.  So, from where you were looking at the time this Exh. A-48 was handed
over by alias Bro to Alias Boy, you cannot tell what is inside because of this
newspaper wrapper, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I know, sir, because I
was told by Allan that it was marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, at the time this
was handed by Alias Bro to Alias Boy, can you see what is inside this wrapped
newspaper?</blockquote>

Alias Boy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You did not see what was
wrapped inside the wrapper?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing testimony, there is nothing therein from which
to draw any reasonable conclusion that accused-appellant knew of the contents
of the package handed to him by Felimon Petilla III alias "Bro" who
happens to be his brother.  There is no
evidence pointing to a conspiracy between "Bro" and the
accused-appellant in the attempt to sell marijuana to the poseur-buyer and
police officers.  For that matter, there
was no agreement or arrangement whether express or implied, direct or indirect,
between the police officers and accused-appellant on the drug deal.  Accused-appellant did not solicit or receive
the marked money.  The only
participation of the accused-appellant, after the package was given to him by
"Bro," was to approach SPO1 Echon and Amora with the manifest purpose
of handing the same to them.  The
package did not stay in the possession of accused-appellant for more than a few
fleeting seconds.  There is not even a
hint that there was a conversation between accused-appellant and
"Bro" wherein the former was apprised of the contents of the package.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that while accused-appellant was
charged in the information with the offense of <u>selling</u> marijuana, the
evidence for the prosecution tended to establish that he was caught in the act
of "delivering" the prohibited drug.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 2(b) of the Dangerous Drugs Act, it is required
that the offender knowingly delivered a dangerous drug to another.  The prosecution miserably failed to prove
that accused-appellant had knowledge of the contents of the package.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i><span style="">People vs. Libag, </span></i>184
SCRA 707 we made the following pronouncement:</p>

<blockquote>"Finally, the information accused Roberto Libag of the
‘attempt to sell, deliver, give away to another and distribute three (3) kilos
of marijuana flowering tops, a prohibited drug <i>well-knowing that the sale,
delivery and </i><i><span style="">distribution </span>to
another of such drug is </i><i><span style="">prohibited
</span>x x x.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is basic that in a criminal case, the prosecution avers
the guilt of the accused who is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is
proved.  Therefore, the prosecution must
prove such guilt by establishing the existence of all the elements of the crime
charged.  In so doing, the prosecution
must rely on the strength of its own evidence, not on the weakness of the
defense.  Clearly, one of the elements
of the offense is that the accused <i>knowingly </i><span style="">delivered a dangerous drug to another.  The prosecution must prove knowledge of the accused, not that he knew
that marijuana is classified as a dangerous drug, but that he </span><i>knew as
marijuana </i><span style="">the contents of the
plastic bag he delivered."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Well-settled is the doctrine that where inculpatory facts are
susceptible of two interpretations, the interpretation that will lead to
acquittal must be sustained.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>
