Hotel, Sta. Cruz, Manila, he met accused-appellant sometime in March 1989 while
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">latter was billeted therein.  During one of their conversations,
accused-appellant offered him an overseas </span>job in the United States of
America as a "boy by washing airplanes" with a salary of $100.00 a
day.  He decided to accept the offer
which he perceived as "an opportunity to work abroad."</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 31, 1989, he went to see accused-appellant at his new
place in Room 304, PM Apartelle,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Matalino Street, Quezon City and gave the latter P3,000.00 for his visa and
plane ticket.  No receipt was issued and
he did not insist on one because accused?appellant threatened that he
would not be able to go abroad if he insists.  In connection with his departure, he underwent a medical examination<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

at the Protacio Hospital for which he paid P270.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant disappeared after complainant was not able to
leave as promised.  He saw the accused
two days later at the latter's apartelle where he explained that the delay was
due to a "need for money." Later, complainants discovered some tapes
in the attache case of accused-appellant.  While playing these, they heard accused-appellant's mother advising his
son to reform as he had already swindled a lot of people in Ilocos.  It was then that they decided to report the
matter to the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant Pedro Enipto, Jr.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
narrated that it was through Eduardo Cortez and one Roger Salvatierra that he
came to know accused-appellant.  During
their initial meeting, accused-appellant talked about his projects at Fort
Ilocandia of which, according to him, he was part owner.  It was in this conversation that he
encouraged them to work in Washington, D.C. as aircraft maintenance crew with a
salary of about hundred dollars.  He
assured them that he was in a position to petition for them to work there
because he was a "balikbayan" and his deceased father was a retired
colonel in Washington.</p>

<p class="BODY">Enipto gave accused-appellant P4,000.00 on May 30, 1989 and
another P3,000.00 on June 2, 1989 at PM Apartelle at the back of Quezon City
Hall.  He did not ask for a receipt
because accused-appellant told him that if he asked for one he would be left
behind.  His aunt, complainant Teresita
Santiago, was present when he gave the money.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant accompanied them in procuring their passport
and undergoing medical examination at Protacio Hospital.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> For
these services, Enipto incurred additional expenses of P550.00 and P270.00,
respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">When they were unable to leave on June 15, 1989 for Washington,
D.C., accused-appellant disappeared.  Later, he called them up to explain that he was the victim of a
holdup.  They waited again to find out
when they could leave.  On his second
call, he asked them to fetch him in Intramuros which they did.  He likewise asked them to get his things at
PM Apartelle.  One of their companions,
Dalton Dizon, discovered a tape where accused-appellant's parents were advising
him not to go back to Laoag because many people were looking for him.  Thereafter, they agreed to report the matter
to the police to whom they gave their statements and the tape.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant Teresita Santiago<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> met
accused-appellant through her nephew Pedro Enipto, Jr. who brought him to her
residence at Novaliches.  Accused-appellant encouraged her to work abroad as baby sitter for
$750.00 a month.  He told her that he
would take care of the expenses that would be incurred except for the plane
ticket but even this would be refunded later.  She believed him as he introduced himself as a millionaire who owns Fort
Ilocandia, Benguet Mining Corp. and Contrex Industrial Corporation.  He also mentioned a certain Atty. Efren
Ramos from Laoag whom she happened to know personally.  He even said that he was a "pamangkin
ni Marcos." Subsequently, he asked for P8,000.00 for the plane ticket
which she gave on May 30, 1989.  Later,
he asked for an additional P5,000.00 which she gave on June 5, 1989.  Both amounts were delivered to
accused-appellant at Room 304, PM Apartelle, Quezon City.  She received no receipt for these amounts
although these transactions were witnessed by Angelita Cawili who corroborated
her testimony on these points.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:432.45pt">On cross-examination, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">she stated further that she </span>entertained
no doubt about the accused-appellant who assured her that he could get jobs
even for twelve persons abroad.  Moreover, he was driving a car when he came to her house and was staying
in an apartelle.  That he gave his
office address in Washington, D.C. and impressed on her that he was a son of a
retired US Air Force officer convinced her of his capability in sending them
abroad.  Accused-appellant even
accompanied them in securing their passports.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
However, the promised trip did not materialize.  Accused-appellant would disappear intermittently and upon
surfacing, would promise to withdraw some money at PNB.  Another time, he called up to inform them
that he was kidnapped for ransom.  When
she asked him to return her money, accused-appellant failed to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant Dalton Dizon<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
testified that accused-appellant was introduced to him by his friend Cesar
Angeles on December 1988.  After this
meeting, they did not see each other again until May 1989 when
accused-appellant went to Dizon's house at 157 Alley 2, Project 6, Quezon City
asking for his help to look for a place to stay in.  Later, they met again at PM Apartelle where<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>accused-appellant offered him
employment in Washington, D.C. as a hospital aide.  In consideration of the promise for employment, he gave the
accused P4,500.00 in the latter's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">apartelle.  No receipt was given for the payment
although his mother, Candelaria Dizon, was with him when he paid said
recruitment fee.  He was asked to secure
a passport while the accused would take care of everything else.  Later, he underwent a medical examination at
Protacio Clinic to determine his physical fitness to work abroad.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Dizon.  He first stayed for one whole
afternoon, at </span>Dalton's parlor in Tandang Sora.  Then, he moved to PM Apartelle, the rent of which was paid by
Dalton's brother, Daniel.  Accused-appellant met the three other complainants during the
"despedida" party of Daniel held at PM Apartelle.  He went to Teresita Santiago's house in
Novaliches upon the latter's invitation for him to eat there.  He admitted receiving P5,000.00 from her as
a loan.  He denied ever claiming that he
was a multi-millionaire and that former Pres. Marcos was his grandfather.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal on the ground that the trial court erred in
convicting accused-appellant for Illegal Recruitment despite the absence of
evidence required to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant points out that the prosecution evidence
consists merely of the testimonies of complainants and the letter he allegedly
wrote addressed to Dalton Dizon where he acknowledged the complaint filed
against him by Teresita Santiago.  These
evidence, according to him, do not prove beyond reasonable doubt that he
illegally recruited complainants.  For
one, the testimonies are nothing but self-serving allegations unsupported by
concrete evidence.  If accused-appellant
did transact with them and receive sums of money as recruitment fees, he would
not have hesitated to give them the corresponding receipts; on the other hand,
complainants should have demanded receipts from him.   In his opinion, it was very unusual for complainants as overseas
applicants to neglect investigating whether the recruiter is licensed or
authorized by the POEA, or has an office address and can issue official receipts.  For another thing, the letter was not shown
to him for his identification; hence, it cannot be given any evidentiary
value.  Granting that the letter was
written by him, its contents acknowledging the receipt of money from Teresita
Santiago refer only to her and the loan she gave him as he testified.  Having <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">transacted
</span>with Teresita Santiago only and never with the three other complainants,
he cannot possibly be convicted under PD 2018, that is, illegal recruitment
committed in large scale and considered an offense involving economic sabotage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution consists mainly of the
testimonies of the four complainants.  The fact that only the testimony of Teresita Santiago was corroborated
by Angelita Cawili does not water down the weight of their combined
testimonies.  It is not necessary that
the testimony of each of the four complainants be corroborated by other
witnesses.  Corroborative evidence is
necessary only when there are reasons to warrant the suspicion that the witness
falsified the truth or that his observations are inaccurate.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, complainant's positively identified accused-appellant as the one
who recruited them for work abroad, employing the same <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">modus</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> <u>operandi</u> </span>for all.  They were one in stating that he assured them that he could find jobs
for them in the United States and on several occasions, inveigled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">them into giving </span>him money in his
apartelle.  Against their clear and
positive testimonies, accused-appellant's defense was merely a denial which the
lower court found to be weak as against the hard evidence built by the
prosecution.  Accused-appellant's attack
is ultimately directed against the credibility of complainants, the best judge
of which is the trial court.  In the
matter of weighing the evidence of the prosecution against that of the defense through
an assessment of their respective merits, "it is firmly settled that the
findings of the trial court are given weight and the highest degree of respect
by the appellate court, and may be disregarded only where substantial errors
have been committed or determinative facts have been overlooked and which
otherwise would have dictated a different conclusion or verdict."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
No reason appears to us to deny great weight to the trial court's evaluation of
complainants' testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">  Accused-appellant
stresses the absence of receipts evidencing complainants' payment and argues
that he would not have hesitated to issue the same if it were true that he did
transact with them.  This argument,
being purely hypothetical, does not strengthen his denial nor weaken the
complainants' testimonies.  That there
were no receipts does not mean that he did not transact with them.  Moreover, he questions complainants' failure
to insist on a receipt after they allegedly paid their recruitment fees.  Complainants have satisfactorily explained
that they did not insist on one because accused-appellant threatened that they
would not be able to depart if they insisted.  Who can fault them for giving up a measly receipt in return for a golden
opportunity to fulfill their dreams of earning easy money abroad?  The Court in an earlier case had observed
that "poor laborers, seamen, domestics, and other workers (who) see
employment abroad as the only way out of their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">grinding </span>poverty."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is nothing unusual in complainants' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">failure to </span>investigate the truth of
appellant's representations <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as regards </span>his
personal and business background for, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">being
inexperienced and </span>titillated by the prospect of traveling to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the proverbial land </span>of milk and honey,
they fell easy prey to appellant's glibness and roseate promises.  Even Teresita Santiago, the eldest
complainant, endowed though she was with a college degree, fell for his suave
ways and could not help but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be
impressed </span>when she saw him driving a car and learned that he was staying

<p class="BODY">When this was formally offered in evidence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused?appellant did not object </span>to
its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">admissibility.  He cannot now deny </span>its authorship and
assert that it should not be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">given </span>evidentiary
value.  While the quoted portion
mentions only Teresita Santiago, it does not support accused-appellant's
alternative theory that if he should be found guilty of having committed illegal
recruitment, it should be limited only to Teresita Santiago whose name was
mentioned in his letter.  A careful
reading shows that accused-appellant promises to return to Teresita Santiago
and company ("nila" Ate Tess) the money he got from them ("kanila")
in connection with his representations that he can send them abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime of illegal recruitment has two elements.  First, the offender is a non-licensee or
non-holder of authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment and placement of
workers; and second, the offender undertakes either any recruitment activity
defined under Article 13 (b) or any prohibited practice enumerated under
Article 34 of the Labor Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> That
the offender is not authorized by the POEA to engage in the recruitment and
placement of workers is evidenced by the certification<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
of the POEA.  In fact, the parties
stipulated on the testimony of Mr. Ruben de Castro, Jr. regarding his lack of
authority.  The testimonies of
complainants unerringly pointed to accused-appellant as the one who enlisted,
contracted and promised employment to them.  Accused-appellant's denial cannot prevail over the positive assertions
of complainants to whom we can hardly ascribe any motive to testify falsely
against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Undoubtedly, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused-appellant's </span>dealings
with the four complainants constitute illegal recruitment committed on a large
scale.</p>
