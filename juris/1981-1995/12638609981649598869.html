<p class="BODY">The Court declared, among other things, that:</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in an assignment of
credit, the consent of the debtor is not necessary to make him liable to the
assignee (adverting to Articles 1625, 1626 and 1627 of the Civil Code), what
the law requires being notice to the debtor and not consent of the latter;</p>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the promissory note,
being payable to order, may be negotiated by mere <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
(Sec. 184, Negotiable Instruments Law);</p>

<p class="BODY">3)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the evidence
sufficiently established that <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> had received
notice of the assignment of his promissory note; and</p>

<p class="BODY">4)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the requirement that
the assignment be evidenced by a public instrument in Article 1625 of the Civil
Code “is only necessary to produce effects against third persons, and Reyes * *
(like <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span>) is not a third person, he being the
debtor of the credit which was assigned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> and Reyes appealed to the Court
of Appeals.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
That Court rendered judgment in due course, affirming that of the Trial
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The affirming judgment has since
been appealed to this Court, but only by <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Decision, the First Division of the Appellate Tribunal,
speaking through the Presiding Justice at the time, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
held as regards <span class="SpellE">Arnaldo's</span> contentions, that -</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>it was <span class="SpellE">TFC's</span> right "to assign, in other words, sell" its
credits against <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> and Reyes, to a third person;</p>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>there was no need that
the assignment be in a public document, this being required only "to
produce** effect as against third persons" (Article 1625, Civil Code),
i.e., "to adversely affect 3rd persons," i.e., "a 3rd person
with a right against original creditor, for example, an original creditor of
creditor, - against whom surely such an assignment by his debtor (creditor in
the credit assigned) would be prejudicial, because he, creditor of assigning
creditor, would thus be deprived of an attachable asset of his debtor **;"</p>

<p class="BODY">3)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>neither <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> nor Reyes could complain against the assignment,
"for whether assigned or not, their obligations were not changed nor
enlarged; of course if they before notice of assignment, had paid unto
Transoceanic, they should not be prejudiced either, such payments made previous
to notice under the law, and in justice, should unto them be credited, - as
indeed, trial Judge credited <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> with his
payments made of P3,011.42 previous to notice unto him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">**;</span>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">4)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that it was the
assignee (PCIB), instead of the creditor-assignor (TFC), which notified <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> of the assignment is of no moment:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"irrespective of who notified him, * *
what is important is that he be notified; * * it is assignee who is most
interested to notify, not creditor assignor who probably would have lost all
interest after he has assigned; if it be argued that if it is assignee who
notifies, that might be questionable, debtor might have his doubts, it is easy
for him; to inquire from his creditor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">**;</span>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">5)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the assignment of <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo's</span> credit was made "after it had become long
overdue," is also inconsequential, since this would not "mean that <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo's</span> obligation had thereby disappeared * *, for the Negotiable
Instruments Law itself says that presentment for payment is not necessary in
order to charge the person primarily liable * *; indeed, it is most difficult
to understand that just because demand was not made with presentation of
evidence of the obligation within a reasonable time, the promissory note can
already be said to have become a dead obligation * * (and) original drawer,
primarily liable, should wait until lapse of prescriptive period for him to
claim that * *;" and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">6)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the claim that the
assignment had not been made by an <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">authorized
</span>official of TFC was untenable not only because "for the first time
raised on appeal but also * * (because) absent any <span class="SpellE">disautorization</span>
from <span class="SpellE">Transoceanic's</span> board of directors, the act of
its President of endorsing unto plaintiff Bank is not easy to see as outside of
the ordinary prerogative of an official in his position, more than this,
perhaps also that should be an intramural matter * * between Board and
President Moreno of Transoceanic, but when President endorsed to plaintiff
Bank, and Bank by that got possession of the promissory note, it already became
duty of debtor to pay unto Bank,- it would on the contrary have been rashness
if after notice of that, debtor should still pay unto Transoceanic, banking on
alleged lack of authority of President of Transoceanic to sign the assignment
**."</p>

<p class="BODY">Except for the question of the claimed lack of authority on the
part of <span class="SpellE">TFC's</span> president to execute the assignment of
credit in favor of PCIB -­ improperly raised for the first time on appeal, as
observed by the Court of Appeals -- the issues raised by <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span>
were set up by him in, and after analysis and assessment rejected by, both the
Trial Court and the Appellate Tribunal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court sees no error whatever in the appreciation of the facts by<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> either Court or their application of the
relevant law and jurisprudence to those facts, inclusive of the question posed
anew by <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> relative to the alleged absence of
authority on the part of <span class="SpellE">TFC's</span> president to assign
the corporation's credit to PCIB.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only other issue set up by <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span>
in this Court is what he alleges to be the failure of PCIB to exhibit to him
his promissory note, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">invoking Section
74 of the Negotiable Instruments Law to the effect that "(t)he instrument
must be exhibited to the person from whom payment is demanded, and when it is
paid must be delivered up to the party paying it." It suffices to dispose
of this issue by pointing out that it was never raised in either the Court of
Appeals or the Trial Court, and cannot be raised for the first time in this
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any case, it is on its face a
petty issue, for (1) if, according to him, such an exhibition was needful to
give him an opportunity to determine the genuineness of the instrument,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> this was rendered unnecessary not only by
his omission to contest it, but also by his admission of the authenticity of
the note implicit from his averment that he had made substantial payments
thereon;</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

"demand, presentment, protest and notice of protest and non-payment"
