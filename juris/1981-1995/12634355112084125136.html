				<BR><STRONG>MELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Both the trial and appellate courts construed the transaction
effected between herein petitioner and private respondent on May 20, 1986 as an
absolute sale of a piece of realty, but petitioner thinks otherwise, saying
that it was a mere equitable mortgage.  Hence, the petition at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court briefly narrated the background of the case
which petitioner did not bother to assail in her pleadings before this Court,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>On May 20, 1986, the parties, with plaintiff-appellant as vendor
and defendant-appellee David Motors and Marketing Corporation (DMMC, for
brevity) through<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:34.0pt"> its </span>representative,
defendant-appellee David, executed by and between themselves a "Deed of
Absolute Sale of Real Property" over a parcel of land (Lot 7-B of the
Subd. plan (LRC) psd-324403, approved as a non-subd. proj. being a portion of
Lot 7 (LRC) Pcs-16468 LRC Rec. No. 5941), including all improvements thereon,
situated in the barrio of Hen. T. de Leon, Municipality of Valenzuela, Metro
Manila, containing an area of Six Hundred Thirty One (631) square meters, more
or less, covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 119038 of the Registry of
Deeds of Caloocan City, and for and in consideration of One Hundred Fifty
Thousand (P150,000.00) Pesos (Exhibit "B" also Exhibit
"2").</blockquote>

<blockquote>On November 27, 1987, plaintiff-appellant filed the instant
complaint, praying for the annulment of the subject deed of absolute sale and
consequent cancellation of the certificate of title obtained by
defendants-appellees by virtue thereof; the interpretation and declaration of
the subject deed of absolute sale as an equitable mortgage; and for a writ of
preliminary injunction (Record, pp. 1-38).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In their answer, defendants-appellees contended that the subject
encumbrance was one of absolute sale (Record, pp. 51-70).</blockquote>

<blockquote>After trial on the merits, the lower court rendered the impugned
decision ... (p. 62, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In her memorandum, petitioner hastened to add a few more details
on how the so-called sale in favor of private respondent evolved.  According to petitioner, she previously
mortgaged the same parcel of land on July 23, 1985 to Mrs. Macaria
Dimafelis.  Before the mortgage matured,
she had to look for other sources from whom she can borrow money to liquidate
the mortgage and this financial constraint led to her being introduced to
Conrado S. David, herein private respondent, through one Natividad de
Gula.  It was in the office of private
respondent where petitioner impressed the idea of utilizing the mortgaged lot
as collateral for the loan which she wanted to obtain from private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In response to the request, private respondent allegedly agreed
to extend the loan subject to the following terms:</p>

<p class="NUM">a) the gross principal amount of the indebtedness shall be
P150,000.00;</p>

<p class="NUM">b) repayment period will be two years with an automatic grace
period of one month;</p>

<p class="NUM">c) interest shall be ten percent a month payable monthly;</p>

<p class="NUM">d) the transaction shall be denominated as an absolute sale
instead of a real estate mortgage; and that</p>

<p class="NUM">e) out of the proceeds of the loan, P40,000.00 will be retained by
private respondent as payment for two months advance interest (P30,000.00 at
P15,000.00 interest a month) and the remaining sum of P10,000.00 will be for
documentation expense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that she was initially reluctant to express her
conformity but she nonetheless agreed to the conditions after she was
supposedly assured by private respondent that the nomenclature attached to
their transaction was a mere formality and that petitioner had no reason to be
apprehensive inasmuch as private respondent will register the deed of
conveyance only if petitioner does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not
pay the monthly interest.  Petitioner
signed the "Deed of Absolute Sale" and surrendered the owner's
duplicate copy of the certificate of title after private respondent issued a
check in the amount of P109,000.00 to Mrs. Dimafelis as </span>full settlement
of petitioner's previous indebtedness.  For her part, petitioner received P1,000.00 in cash and was made to sign
a cash voucher to show that she received P150,000.00.  Further, payment of the interest for four months was allegedly
made to private respondent, who did not issue any receipt therefor, until
petitioner discovered, to her dismay, that the instrument was registered which
triggered the issuance of a new certificate of title in the name of respondent
corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">All of the foregoing statements were derived by petitioner from
her open court declarations when she sat on the witness stand in order to
develop the theory that the entire scheme was a simple loan accommodation.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the trial court was far from convinced by petitioner's
disquisition and neither was respondent court which concurred with the factual
observation of the court of origin that gross inadequacy of price had not been
sufficiently demonstrated.  In
interpreting the covenant as an absolute transmission of dominion in favor of
private respondent, Justices Aldecoa, Jr., Campos, and Felimon Mendoza were in
unison when they declared that none of the badges of an equitable mortgage
under Article 1602 of the Civil Code can be appreciated in favor of herein
petitioner (p. 68, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Of particular significance to the resolution of the question on
the true character of the disputed transaction are the contemporaneous and
subsequent acts of the contracting parties which have been translated into
testimonial evidence in the course of the trial on the merits.  Indeed, this specie of evidentiary proof,
known as the Parol Evidence Rule, may well be the acknowledged adjective norm
that can spell the difference between success or failure of the instant
petition (<u>Macapinlac vs. Gutierrez </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Repide</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, 43 Phil. 770
[1922]; <u>Cuyugan vs. Santos</u>, 34 Phil. </span>100 [1916]).  For there can be a better appreciation of
the problem at hand only if we resort to what the parties had already
emphasized below to buttress their respective contentions and in this respect,
the decision of respondent court seems a bit deficient considering that it
relied more on the alleged sufficiency of the purchase price (p. 66, Rollo) and
the bare fact that petitioner, who was accompanied by her "businesswoman
daughter", could not have been duped into accepting private respondent's
offer to purchase the property (p. 67, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">We concede that on these two aspects, we do not occupy a superior
position to brush aside what respondent court arrived at but the so-called
adequacy of the consideration, pegged at P150,000.00 by private respondent
himself (p. 33, Rollo) for a 631 square meter lot, and the impression of
petitioner's willingness to absolutely part with her possession, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">do </span>not necessarily diminish the
existence of other circumstances under Article 1602 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">  Verily, petitioner
endeavored to demonstrate her financial constraint and the need to pay off the
mortgage in favor of Mrs. Dimafelis, which she was able to rectify by
approaching Conrado S. David who offered to help thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other end of this controversy is private respondent's
indifference throughout his comment (p. 81, Rollo) and memorandum as well (p.
200, Rollo) <u>vis-a-vis</u> the clarification made by petitioner herself and
petitioner's daughter which unconcerned and nonchalant attitude inevitably
leads to the conclusion that petitioner had established her <u>onus probandi</u>
by a preponderance of evidence and that private respondent had failed to prove
his positive allegations in support of his stance (<u>Section 1</u>, Rule 131,
Revised Rules on Evidence).  Apart from
this procedural axiom is our belief that private respondent's demeanor in
retaining a portion of the alleged purchase price, as advance interest for two
months, is akin to, if not precisely the very circumstance mentioned by Article
1602(4) of the Civil Code that will warrant the legal presumption of an
equitable mortgage.  Besides, it was
erroneous for respondent court to have made a sweeping insinuation that it was
petitioner as vendor who suggested the "purchase price" and is thus
precluded from assailing the sufficiency thereof (p. 66, Rollo), on account of
the admission <u>in judicio</u> of private respondent that it was he who
"placed the value of P150,000.00" as consideration on the document
(p. 33, Rollo; TSN, April 6, 1989, pp. 8-11).  The fact that petitioner was accompanied by her "businesswoman
daughter" to the office of private respondent is of no practical bearing
because even persons of average intelligence invariably find themselves <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>no position whatsoever when
bargaining with their creditor (<u>Cabigao vs. Sales, et al</u>., (C.A.) 51
O.G. 5265; 5 <u>Tolentino</u>, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil
Code, 1959 edition, p. 137) such as private respondent's corporation whose
primary business concern includes giving loans (TSN, March 30, 1989, pp. 8-10;
p. 32, Rollo).  Moreover, it may be
recalled that petitioner only received the sum of P1,000.00 out of the
P150,000.00 alleged as consideration for the "sale" (p. 18, <u>supra</u>).  Such a measly sum is certainly another
circumstance that reinforces our belief that the entire transaction was but a
loan accommodation since no seller in her right senses will part with her
treasured possession <u>via</u> a tedious process only to end up with a small
sum of money in her pocket as consideration therefor.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, substantive law mandates that a contract purporting
to be <u>venta con pacto de retro</u> or an outright sale shall be construed as
an equitable mortgage for it involves a smaller transmission of rights (<u>Olino
vs. Molina</u>, 13 Phil. 379 (1909); <u>Villa vs. Santiago</u>, 38 Phil. 157<i>
</i>(1918); 5 <u>Tolentino</u>, <u>supra</u>, at p. 15).  Moreover, there is no doubt that petitioner
agreed to the execution of the so-called sale in favor of private respondent
because of the urgent necessity for money of the apparent vendor to liquidate
her indebtedness to Mrs. Dimafelis (<u>Claravall vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 190
SCRA 439 (1990); <u>Labasan vs. Lacuesta</u>, 86 SCRA 16 (1978).  This is another circumstance where it may be
fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties is for the transaction to
secure the payment of a debt or the performance of any other obligation (<u>Article
1602(6)</u>, New Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of respondent court dated October
10, 1991 is hereby SET ASIDE.  The deed
of absolute sale executed by Lea O. Camus in favor of Conrado S. David is
hereby declared as an equitable mortgage and, petitioner is declared entitled
to redeem the property.  Private
respondent is hereby ordered to execute the necessary deed of conveyance upon full
payment of the total amount of P110,000.00 with legal interest from May 20,
1986, the time the loan matured until it is fully satisfied.</p>
