and invited her to go with him since they both reside in <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They boarded a passenger jeep and alighted at
Plaza Sta. Cruz, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> where <span class="SpellE">Simbulan</span> invited her to a snack at a nearby
restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Simbulan</span> hailed a taxi, boarded the same with Bernadette
and told the driver to stop at the Philippine Rabbit Bus station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bernadette was surprised and she asked <span class="SpellE">Simbulan</span> where they were going.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused told her that he would get something
from a relative who lives nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
place "nearby" turned out to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">at
</span><span class="SpellE">Tulauc</span>, San Simon, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arriving at barrio <span class="SpellE">Tulauc</span> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30</st1:time> in the afternoon, they stayed in the
house of <span class="SpellE">Emerita</span> <span class="SpellE">Simbulan</span>,
a cousin of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They partook of
a <span class="SpellE">merienda</span> following which complainant told the
accused that she wanted to go home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simbulan</span> answered that he was still waiting for another

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1964</st1:date>,
Chief of Police David Santos of San Simon, accompanied by a patrolman, arrived
at the house where accused and complainant were found and they informed her
that her parents had been looking for her and were waiting in the municipal
building of San Simon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainant
went with the police while the accused followed in another jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General in his brief
manifested:</p>

give a normal statement to the police despite four (4) hours respite at the
municipal building.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She later told the
police chief that they will file a complaint against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police chief advised the complainant to
consult a lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The incident was
entered in the police blotter; a certified true copy (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, accused-appellant claims that his sexual
intercourse with Bernadette was voluntarily consummated and that they were
sweethearts when they eloped on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1964</st1:date> to San Simon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
acquaintanceship started in 1960 when they were neighbors in the <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span> Compound in <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both used to
be leaders of the youth in the community, so much so that in 1964 appellant was
elected president and the complainant, secretary of the "Junior and Senior
Club" in their community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also
stood as sponsors in one of the baptismal ceremonies of one of the children of
a member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they are "<span class="SpellE">compadre</span> and <span class="SpellE">comadre</span>." It
was on <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1964</st1:date>
when they went to <span class="SpellE">Tulauc</span> for the first time and that
was also the first time they had sexual intercourse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of the same day, they went
home to their respective residences in <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span> as
if nothing had happened, although they kept to themselves their plan to elope
on <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1964</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As agreed upon, about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1964</st1:date>,
he fetched Bernadette at the <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> gate of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sto</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.
Tomas and, with her belongings, they proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Tulauc</span>,
reaching the place at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00</st1:time> in
the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1964</st1:date> they stayed at the house of his
cousin, <span class="SpellE">Emerita</span> <span class="SpellE">Simbulan</span>,
as husband and wife, until December 10 when the Chief of Police of San Simon,
with another policeman, arrived at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time>
in the morning and informed then that the complainant's parents were at the
municipal hall waiting for Bernadette.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They went with the police authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bernadette frankly told them that she loves <span class="SpellE">Mading</span>
and would prefer to die than leave him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At this juncture, her mother hit her on the face and in her body and
dragged complainant at the waiting jeep despite her protestation and shouts,
"Do not separate me from <span class="SpellE">Mading</span>, I love him so
much."</p>

<p class="BODY">After they had left, appellant went back to his temporary
residence in <span class="SpellE">Tulauc</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was not investigated by the Chief of Police regarding the circumstances
why she was with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Everything seemed
to have been forgotten until May 1965 when he received a subpoena from the
municipal judge of San Simon directing him to testify in a case of rape filed
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot sustain the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The uncorroborated testimony of the offended party in cases of
rape may be sufficient under certain cir­cumstances to warrant a conviction,
yet, "from the very nature of the charge and the ease with which it may be
made and the difficulty which surrounds the accused in disproving it where the
point at issue as to whether the cohabitation was had with or without the use
of force or threats, it is imperative that such testimony should be scrutinized
with the greatest caution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In all such
cases the conduct of the woman immediately following the alleged assault is of
the utmost importance as tending to establish the truth or falsity of the
charge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed it may well be doubted
whether a conviction of the offense of rape should ever be sustained upon the uncorroborated
testimony of the woman unless the court is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that her conduct at the time when the alleged rape was committed and
immediately thereafter was such as might be reasonably expected from her under
all the circumstances of the case." (<st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>, 26
Phil. 268).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, when the complainant went with appellant she
had with her two bags containing <span class="SpellE">clothings</span> and
personal belongings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This serves to
indicate that she eloped with appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that Bernadette testified that she got them from her
Auntie's boarding house in nearby <span class="SpellE">Sulucan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila, where she used to board and that she was
to bring them home to <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span> on December 7,
1964, the last day of classes, this was belied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Coming from her house on December 7, 1964, at 6:00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the morning, it is indeed
surprising that she would bring with her two bags of clothes if it was not her
intention to elope with appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And,
assuming that after her classes that morning, she went to her Auntie's place to
get her things because that was the last day of classes, We take judicial
notice that Christmas vacation does not start that early but, somewhere after
December 15.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, We take note of the
fact that the complainant was physically examined by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Nalaga</span>
whose report reads:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"hymen x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> with superficial healed
lacerations at 4:00 and 9:00 positions x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> ."</span>
The examination on complainant was made on December 14, 1964, or seven (7) days
after the alleged rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with
the defense that the lacerations could not have healed within such a short
period of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">seven </span>days, from
December 7 to December 14, 1964.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
result of the examination supports the theory of the defense that a month before,
on November 3, 1964, complainant and appellant had their first carnal
intercourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, there was lack of tenacious resistance or objection on
the part of Bernadette when after having taken their snack somewhere at Sta.
Cruz, Manila they took a taxi and proceeded to the Philippine Rabbit Bus
station somewhere in <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That alone was a warning that they were going
somewhere outside Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If, as
claimed by the prosecution, there was no consent on her part to go with
appellant she could have easily taken her own transportation to go to her
residence at <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was absolutely no resistance made to
free herself from the clutches of <span class="SpellE">Simbulan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the number of people in the area,
appellant could not have forced her to go with him unless there was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">willingness </span>on her part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">And, </span>finally,
the delay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in giving </span>her written
statement to the police (Exhibit "7"), and the filing of the case in
the municipal court of San <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Simon, </span><span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> (Exhibit "10"), both on March 17, 1965
are circumstances which create reasonable doubt that the crime of rape was
committed on December 7, 1964.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a
case, (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Gabiana</span>, 117 SCRA 260); it was held
that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> two other
circumstances which, if carefully appraised, lead to the conclusion that the
guilt of the accused has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first was the absence of any positive
statement that she was raped right after the alleged incident when her state of
natural indignation would have prompted her to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second, even more telling, circumstance
was that while the alleged incident took place on April 29, 1973, she failed to
identify appellant as the rapist until May 7, fully nine days after the
event." In the case at bar, more than three (3) months had elapsed before
the case was filed in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She could
have narrated to the police the alleged rape when she was allegedly rescued on
December 10, 1964.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This she did not do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mendiguarin</span>,
92 SCRA 679, this Court "already observed that the books disclose many
instances of trumped-up charges of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In rape cases the testimony of the offended woman should not be received
with precipitate credulity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
uncorroborated testimony should not be accepted unless her sincerity and candor
are free from suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A little
insight into human nature is of utmost value in judging matters of this
kind." Under the circumstances, it would be in keeping with the
fundamental principle that to justify conviction there must be proof of moral
certainty otherwise the accused is entitled to acquittal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 1973 Constitution provides that "in
all criminal prosecutions the accused shall be presumed innocent until the
contrary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">is </span>proved." Rule
