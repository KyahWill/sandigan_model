<p class="2Q">"a position declared primarily confidential comes within the
purview of Section 4, Article XII of the Cons­titution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The permanent incumbent thereof can only be

removing petitioners is that their term of office are co-terminus with the term

separate them from the service any time upon the termination of office of the
public officials to whom they are rendering their services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot subscribe to this argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of their appointment the
petitioners are clearly assigned to the Office of the Vice-Mayor and not to the
particular officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The office is
permanent but the officers' stay in office is not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So long as the Office of the Vice-Mayor
exists whoever may be the occupant of the office, the petitioners are under
obligation to discharge their duties until their services are lawfully
terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the right of
the petitioners to stay in their position is co-terminus with the Office of the
Vice?Mayor and not with the term of any specified incumbent of the
office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Mayor has admitted
that the appointments of petitioners German O. <span class="SpellE">Lumapac</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Elizondo</span> are
permanent, although he contends that they are permanent only as noted in their
respective appointment papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If their
appointments are permanent as noted in their appointments then definitely they
enjoy a permanent status for what characterizes an appointment is the nature of
the appointment extended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Villanosa</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Alera</span>, L-10586, May
29, 1957).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The very nature of their
appointments are reflected in the appointment papers themselves.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent Mayor claims that the lower court erred in not
finding that petitioners have failed to exhaust administrative remedies before
filing the present action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends
that under Section 16, paragraph (j) of the Civil Service Act of 1959 it is
within the power of the <span class="SpellE">Commisioner</span> to hear and
determine Appeals by a person aggrieved by an action or determination of any
appointing authority contrary to the provisions of the Civil Service Law and
Rules and therefore petitioners should have taken their case to the <span class="SpellE">Commisioner</span> of Civil Service and waited for his decision on
the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He in­sists that failure of
petitioners to pursue such remedy provided by the Civil Service Act is fatal to
their claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 8 of the

failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said paragraph provides:</blockquote>

In said case, Benjamin A. Gray was appointed Secretary to the Board of

Corporation (PHHC). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On <st1:date year="1959" day="12" month="1">12 January 1959</st1:date>, he sent a telegram

misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, the
PHHC Board of Directors passed Resolution No. 331 terminating his services on

upholding the validity of Resolution No. 331 on the ground that the sending of
the telegram to President Garcia was an act of treachery or disloyalty to the
Board of Director and constituted cause for his removal from office at any
time, considering that the position of Board Secretary was primarily
confidential in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, this

that a board secretary whose appointment was permanent may be removed from
office without a formal charge specifying the ground for removal and without
giving him an opportunity of being heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

out, the sending of the telegram to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was an act of civic duty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The telegram

<blockquote><u>Second</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The position
of secretary to the board of a government corporation was declared by the
President in Executive Order No. 399 primarily confidential in nature with the
obvious intent that the position be filled by an appointee of unquestioned
honesty and integrity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the act of
Board Secretary Gray in reporting to the President of the Board's acts of
mismanage­ment and misconduct was in consonance with the honesty and integrity
required for the position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming that Gray owed loyalty to the Board, that loyalty was
in the interest of good government and not in the personal interest of the
directors to the extent of concealing the shenanigans of the Board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the charges of mismanagement and mis­conduct contained in
the telegram were false, the Board of Directors should have required Board
Secretary Gray to show cause why he should not be removed from office for
making such false charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Board
Secretary would have been given an opportunity of being heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If unable to substantiate his charges, the Board
could have made a finding to that effect and remove Board Secretary Gray from
office for serious misconduct (not for treachery or disloyalty to the Board).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2) Assuming, <span class="SpellE"><u style="text-underline:

constituted lawful cause for his removal from office, the fact remains that he
was summarily removed one day after he had sent the telegram, and that no
formal charge was filed against him stating the ground for removal and giving
him an opportunity of being heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was, thus, removed from office without due process of law, in view of which his
removal was illegal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Petitioners contend however that there is
no parallelism between the <u>Gray case</u> and the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They claim that the removal of Gray as PHHC
board secretary was declared illegal because of some attendant vital
considerations in said case, not present in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, petitioners contend that the
present case is not "on all fours" with the Gray case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they argue that the loyalty of Gray was
to the Board, in the interest of good government, and not, in the personal
interest of the members of the Board of Directors, and that the relationship
between Gray and the PHHC Board of Directors and the relationship between
private respondents and the Vice-Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City
are totally different, for the latter denotes a very close personal relation by
reason of the nature of the duties and functions of a <u>Security</u> <u>Officer</u>
<u>and</u> <u>Security</u> <u>Guard</u>, while the former does not.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are two (2) instances when a position may be considered
primarily confidential:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) when the
President, upon recommendation of the Commissioner of Civil Service, has
declared the position to be primarily confidential; or (2) in the absence of
such declaration, when by the nature of the functions of the office, there
exists close intimacy between the appointee and the appointing power, which
insures freedom of intercourse without embarrassment or freedom from misgiving
of betrayals of personal trust or confidential matters of state.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
However, upon the enactment of the 1959 Civil Service Act (RA 2260), it is the <u>nature</u>
of the position which finally determines whether a position is primarily
confidential.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Executive pronouncements
can be no more than <u>initial</u> determinations that are not conclusive in
case of conflict.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, Section 5 of the 1959 Civil Service Act (RA 2260) provides, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 5, <u>The Non-competitive Service</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- The non-competitive or unclassified service
shall be composed of positions expressly declared by law to be in the
non-competitive or unclassified ser­vice or <u>those which are</u> policy
determining, prima­rily confidential or highly technical <u>in</u> <u>nature</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(underscoring ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Gray</u> case, Executive Order No. 399 which dec­lared
the position of secretary to the Board of Director of a government corporation
"primarily confidential in nature" was issued on 5 January 1951,
i.e., before the enactment of the 1959 Civil Service Act (RA 2260).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As held by this Court in said Gray case,
"(t)he position of secretary to the board of a government corporation was
declared by the President in Executive Order No. 399 primarily confidential
with the obvious intent that the position be filled by an appointee of
unquestioned honesty and integrity" and that the "act of Board Secretary
Gray in reporting to the President the Board's acts of mismanagement and
misconduct was in consonance with the honesty and integrity <u>required</u> of
the posi­tion".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
"honesty" and "integrity", were the primary considerations
for appointment to the position of board secretary of a government
corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The position did not,
however, involve "such close intimacy" between the board secretary
and the Board of Directors of the PHHC, as would insure "freedom from
misgivings of betrayals of per­sonal trust".</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the positions of Senior Security and
Security Guard in the Office of the Vice-Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City, are primarily confidential in nature because of the duties and functions
attached to said positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his
request for certification for eligibility as Senior Security, private
respondent German O. <span class="SpellE">Lumapac</span> enumerated his duties,
as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) to give adequate
protection for the Vice-Mayor's safety; (2) to accompany the Vice-Mayor in all
his appointments; and (3) to perform other duties assigned to him by the
Vice-Mayor from time to time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, as Security Guard, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
<span class="SpellE">Elizondo</span> performs the following duties:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) to act as body­guard of the person of the
Vice-Mayor; (2) to prepare secu­rity measures for the safety of the Vice-Mayor;
and (3) to perform other duties which the Vice-Mayor may assign to him from
time to time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
By virtue of the nature of the duties and functions attached to said positions,
the rela­tionship between the Vice-Mayor and his Security is one that depends
on the highest degree of trust and confidence, such that trust and confidence
are the primary reasons for appointment thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, private respondents were
appointed to said positions upon the recommendation of the then Vice-Mayor Luis
V. <span class="SpellE">Diores</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Borres</span> should not be deprived of
the right to choose his own men to act as his Security.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, the Court holds that the rule laid
down in <u>Gray vs. De Vera</u> is not applicable to the factual environment of
the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The tenure of personnel holding primarily confidential positions,
such as the respondents, ends upon loss of confidence, because their term of
office lasts only as long as confidence in them endures, thus, their cessation
involves no removal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

where the petitioner therein was appointed to the position of Confidential
Agent in the Office of the Auditor, GSIS, which position was likewise declared
as primarily confidential under Executive Order No. 265, this Court in
upholding her termination held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her position being primarily confidential,
petitioner cannot complain that the ter­mination of her services as confidential
agent in the Office of the Auditor, GSIS is in violation of her security of
tenure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Delos Santos vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>, supra, primarily confidential positions are
excluded from the merit system, and dismissal at pleasure of officers or employees
therein is allowed by the Constitution, although in Ingles vs. <span class="SpellE">Mutuc</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
this assumption was held to be inaccurate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to the Court, the proper expression to be used is that the
term of the incumbent merely expires.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus in said case, the Court held:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">`This should not be misunder­stood as denying that the incumbent of
a primarily confidential position holds office at the pleasure only of the appointing
power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, however, that
when such plea­sure turns into displeasure, the incumbent is not 'removed' or
'dismissed' from office -- his 'term' merely 'expires' in much the same way as
an officer, whose right thereto ceases upon the expiration of the fixed term
for which he had been appointed or elected, is not and cannot be deemed 'removed'
or 'dismissed' <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, upon the expiration of said
term.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The main difference between the
former ­-- the primarily confidential officer -- and the latter is that the
latter's term is fixed or definite, whereas the former is not prefixed, but indefinite,
at the time of his appointment or election, and becomes fixed and determined
when the appointing power expresses its decision to put an end to the services
of the incumbent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When this event takes
place, the latter is not 'removed' or 'dismissed' from office -- his term has
merely 'expired'.</p>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, it can be said that petitio­ner was not removed
from her office as confidential agent in the office of the Auditor, GSIS, but
that her term to said position has already expired when the appointing power
terminated her services."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, in the case at bar, it may also be said, with equal
vigor, that when petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Borres</span>, terminated the services of private respondents
"due to lack of confidence", they were not "removed" or
"dismissed" from the service; their "term" in their
respective positions merely "expired".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they were not illegally
"removed" or "dis­missed" from the service.</p>

necessary to discuss the other issues raised in the petition.</p>
