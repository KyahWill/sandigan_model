This is a petition for review on <em>certiorari </em>of the resolution 
issued on November 10, 1982 by the respondent National Labor Relations 
Commission (NLRC) in Case No. AB-8-12274-81, entitled "Adelaida Dangan 
v. Tierra Factors Corporation", dismissing petitioner's appeal and 
affirming the decision of the labor arbiter which ordered her 
reinstatement without backwages.
<p>
This case arose out of two complaints filed by the petitioner against 
Tierra Factors Corporation for illegal demotion and illegal constructive
 dismissal.
</p><p>
We have given partial due course to the petition and considered the respondents' comments as an answer.
</p><p>
The antecedent facts are undisputed.
</p><p>
The petitioner started her employment with the respondent firm on 
January 24, 1977 as a purchasing clerk on probationary basis with a 
basic salary of P450.00.  On May 1, 1977, she was made a permanent 
employee with a monthly salary of P500.00.  On July 16, 1979, she was 
transferred from the Purchasing Department to the Financial Services 
Department as clerk-typist.  On May 1, 1980, she was promoted as 
Secretary to the Manager of the Financial Services Department with a new
 salary rate of P1,090.00 per month.  On February 15, 1981, the 
petitioner's boss, Manager Andres S. Roy F. Lim tendered his resignation
 from the company effective a month later.  Sometime in March, 1981, 
petitioner Dangan was re-assigned as clerk-typist in the Logistics 
Department.  On May 15, 1981, she was pulled out of Logistics and 
assigned as billing clerk in the Accounting Department.  From July 20, 
1981 to October 1, 1981, the petitioner went on maternity leave.  On 
October 3, 1981, the corporation transferred Dangan from her temporary 
assignment in the Billing Section to Secretary to the Technical Training
 Senior Manager with office at Bicutan, Taguig, Metro Manila.  It was at
 this juncture that she filed the first complaint for illegal demotion. 
 Because her maternity leave had expired, the petitioner applied for 
vacation and sick leaves which were approved by management ending 
November 1, 1981.
</p><p>
On November 6, 1981, in response to a telegram sent by her employer, 
Mrs. Dangan submitted a letter to the respondent's Personnel Manager 
Leonardo A. Pineda, informing him that she will not be reporting for 
work until the instant case has been decided and terminated.
</p><p>
On November 10, 1981, the respondent sent Mrs. Dangan a memorandum requiring her to report for work on November 12, 1981.
</p><p>
On December 10, 1981, the petitioner filed the second case against the 
respondent for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice.
</p><p>
The dispositive portion of the arbiter's decision which was affirmed by the NLRC reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, this case should be, as it is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. </p>
  <p> "Respondent, however, is ordered to accept complainant back to 
work but without backwages.  And complainant is directed to report to 
work within fifteen (15) days from receipt of this decision.  Failure to
 do so would mean waiver on her right to reinstatement."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner prays for the modification of the aforequoted decision and assigns as errors the following:
</p><p align="center">
I
</p><p align="center">
THE HONORABLE RESPONDENT COMMISSION ERRED IN ORDERING THE REINSTATEMENT 
OF THE PETITIONER WITHOUT PAYMENT OF BACKWAGES FROM THE TIME OF HER 
TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT AND WITHOUT DECLARING THAT SAID 
REINSTATEMENT SHOULD BE TO HER FORMER POSITION OF DEPARTMENT SECRETARY 
AT PRIVATE RESPONDENT'S MAKATI OFFICES.
</p><p align="center">
II
</p><p align="center">
IF EVER PETITIONER'S POSITION WITH THE COMPANY BECAME REDUNDANT AS 
UPHELD BY THE HONORABLE RESPONDENT COMMISSION, PRIVATE RESPONDENT SHOULD
 NOT TRANSFER PETITIONER TO ITS BICUTAN OFFICE BUT INSTEAD SHOULD PAY 
HER THE SEPARATION PAY PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 284 OF THE NEW LABOR CODE, AS
 AMENDED.
</p><p>
It is petitioner's contention that as the secretary of Mr. Andres Roy F.
 Lim, Manager of the Financial Services Department, she was merely 
following-up Mr. Lim's termination pay after his resignation but these 
follow-ups were resented by the respondent's officials.  As a result, 
she claims to have been harassed and discriminated against in her job, 
transferred from one position to another against her will and demoted 
from department secretary to clerk typist and to killing clerk.  The 
petitioner alleges that the order to report to the Bicutan office was 
really intended to ease her out of the service.
</p><p>
The recorded evidence supports the private respondent's allegations that
 the relief of the petitioner from her job as secretary to the manager 
for financial services was warranted by actual and substantial economic 
justifications.  As early as September 15, 1980, and long before the 
resignation of Mr. Lim from the company, the private respondent had 
already adopted remedial measures designed to counteract economic 
problems faced by the company.  The private respondent stopped all 
manpower hiring except for certain technical positions and informed its 
staff that in the exercise of optimum utilization of manpower movements,
 personnel may be transferred laterally and vertically and even in 
office locations, if necessary.  Pursuant to the company's retrenchment 
program, the Financial Services Department was abolished.  As a result 
of the abolition, the petitioner had to be assigned elsewhere.  The 
labor arbiter found nothing questionable nor suspicious in the company's
 retrenchment program and instead recognized that it was genuinely 
motivated.  Thus, the company proved that in 1980, twenty-nine (29) 
personnel who had either resigned or had been terminated were not 
replaced.
</p><p>
We, therefore, agree with the public respondent's findings that the 
company was not guilty of illegal constructive dismissal and that 
instead of being terminated in her employment, the petitioner was merely
 re-assigned pursuant to a legitimate exercise of managerial 
prerogatives.
</p><p>
The petitioner's contentions that her plight was ignored because she was
 a secretary to Mr. Lim whom the private respondent "hated" have no 
merit.  The facts show otherwise.
</p><p>
It is perhaps timely to reiterate well settled principles involving 
decisions of administrative agencies.  Findings of quasi judicial 
agencies which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is 
confined to specific matters are generally accorded not only respect but
 at times even finality if such findings are supported by substantial 
evidence.  (Special Events and Central Shipping Office Workers Union v. 
San Miguel Corporation, 122 SCRA 557 citing International Hardwood and 
Veneer Co. of the Philippines v. Hon. Vicente Leogardo, et al., 117 SCRA
 967; Genconsu Free Workers Union v. Inciong, 91 SCRA 311; Dy Keh Beng 
v. International Labor and Marine Union of the Phil., 90 SCRA 162).  And
 in a catena of cases, this Court has held that the findings of facts of
 the National Labor Relations Commission are binding on the Court 
(Philippine Labor Alliance Council PLAC v. Bureau of Labor Relations, 75
 SCRA 162; Pan-Phil. Life Insurance Co. v. NLRC, 114 SCRA 866; 
Pepsi-Cola Labor Union - BFLU-TUPAS Local Chapter No. 896 v. NLRC, 114 
SCRA 960) if supported by substantial evidence (Reyes v. Philippine 
Duplicators, Inc., 109 SCRA 438).
</p><p>
The factual findings of the public respondent show that Tierra Factors 
Corporation was merely exercising management prerogatives recognized by 
the Labor Code which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    Art. 284.  Closure of Establishment and Reduction of Personnel. - 
The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due to 
the installation of labor-saving devices, <em>redundancy, retrenchment</em>
 to prevent losses or the closing or cessation of operation of the 
establishment or undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of 
circumventing the provisions of this title, x x x." (Emphasis supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This Court has always sought to implement in proper cases the social 
justice and protection to labor provisions found in Sections 6 and 9 
respectively of Article II of the Constitution.  But at the same time, 
we have also accorded justice to the employer by recognizing and 
affirming its right to lay off and dismiss employees justified by losses
 in its operations, lack of work, and considerable reduction in the 
volume of business.  (Gregorio Araneta Employeesâ€™ Union, et al. v. 
Roldan, et al., 97 Phil. 304; Special Events and Central Shipping Office
 Workers' Unions v. San Miguel Corp., 122 SCRA 557; Redundancy:  Shell 
Oil Workers' Union v. Shell Co. of the Phil., Ltd., L-28607, Feb. 12, 
1972; LVN Pictures Employees' and Workers Association v. LVN Pictures, 
Inc., 35 SCRA 147).
</p><p>
In a fairly recent case, this Court had occasion to reiterate 
management's prerogative to close or abolish a department or section of 
the employer's establishment for economic reasons.  We reasoned out that
 since the greater right to close the entire establishment and cease 
operations due to adverse economic conditions is granted an employer, 
the closure of a part thereof to minimize expenses and reduce 
capitalization should also be recognized.  Thus, in <em>Special Events Central Shipping Office Worker's Union v. San Miguel Corporation</em> (122 SCRA 557) we ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The determination of the usefulness of a section being a company 
prerogative, the closure may not be questioned specially in this case 
where it is impelled by economic reasons due to the continuous losses 
sustained in its operations coupled with the lack of demand for services
 of such section.  In Insular Lumber Co. Inc., v. CA, 80 SCRA 28, it was
 held that just cause for terminating employment within a definite 
period is closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or 
enterprise.  While it is true that only one section of the company is 
affected, the section involved in this case is one where the continuous 
work could not even be guaranteed, and it was held in Pan-Am World 
Airways, Inc. v. CIR, et al., 17 SCRA 813 that lack of work as a cause 
of lay-off is justified."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We note, moreover, that instead of terminating the petitioner's 
employment, the private respondent merely reassigned her to other 
temporary positions before giving her a permanent job as secretary in 
the Technical Training Department located at Bicutan, Taguig, Metro 
Manila.  The acts of the company negate the petitioner's claim of 
discrimination and illegal constructive dismissal.  It tried its best to
 continue using her services.  Needless to say, no reinstatement can be 
effected because the petitioner has not been dismissed.  Neither may she
 be reinstated to her former position which no longer exists.  <em>Ad imposible nemo tenetur</em>.
  Insofar as this aspect of the petition is concerned, the respondent 
NLRC committed no abuse of discretion in dismissing the petitioner's 
appeal.
</p><p>
The petitioner's termination from her last position as secretary to the 
Senior Manager for Technical Training based on abandonment is, however, a
 different matter.  As earlier adverted to, the respondent Commission 
found the petitioner's dismissal on the ground of unauthorized absences 
to be illegal.  Abandonment cannot be a basis for termination of 
employment, because the transfer to Bicutan was precisely the issue 
being raised by the petitioner against the employer.  According to Mrs. 
Dangan, her being transferred to Bicutan was an act of harassment and 
discrimination.  She could not, therefore, be expected to report for 
work at her new assignment until the cases she filed had been resolved.
</p><p>
At the same time, the employer cannot be compelled to pay her backwages 
during a period when she was not working because of a sincere but 
mistaken belief that she was being harassed and persecuted for having 
worked as private secretary to an executive who resigned.  The 
petitioner has the option of accepting a reassignment to the 
respondent's Bicutan offices without any backwages.  Otherwise, she may 
avail herself of the separation pay to which an employee laid off due to
 retrenchment is entitled under the law.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is partly GRANTED insofar as petitioner's 
reinstatement as Secretary, Technical Training Department is concerned. 
 In the alternative, the employer shall cause payment to the petitioner 
of separation pay computed on the basis of her compensation as 
Secretary, Technical Training Department.  The petition is DENIED 
insofar as it prays that private respondent be required to reinstate the
 petitioner to the position of Secretary, Technical Services Department,
 with full backwages.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
