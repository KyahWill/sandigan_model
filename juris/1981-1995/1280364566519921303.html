				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> Ronito Ponsica y Pueblas appeals from a decision of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, finding him guilty of violation of Section 15, Article III of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act.<br><br>Appellant was charged under the following information:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 4th day of January, 1992, at about 1:30 in the afternoon, in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, with deliberate intent, did then and there sell, deliver and give away one (1) pack of shabu powder which contains a methamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug, to a person who posted [sic] himself as buyer, without authority of law.<br><br>Contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote>At arraignment, appellant Ponsica entered a plea of not guilty. Trial ensued and judgment was rendered on 19 August 1992 as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the accused Ronito Ponsica Y Pueblas is hereby found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the offense alleged in the information. He is accordingly sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P25.000.00. The one deck of shabu or methamphetamine hydrochloride is hereby ordered confiscated in favor of the Dangerous Drugs Board.<br><br>Costs against the accused. SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>The prosecution's version of the relevant facts is as follows.<br><br>On 4 January 1992, a Narcotics Command, PNP, "buy-bust" team composed of SP02 Hermes Recla, SP02 Ibrahim Mohammadshaid and SPO1 Felixberto Sultan was formed to entrap and arrest appellant Ponsica who had been the subject of numerous complaints from concerned parents for drug pushing. This operation ensued after surveillance of Ponsica which had been initiated on 1 January 1992 at the Carbon Market in Sitio Bato, Barangay Ermita, Cebu City, and during which he had been observed to be openly selling <u>shabu</u>.<br><br>At about 1:30 in the afternoon of 4 January 1992, the team reached their target area which was a small alley in the Carbon Market. SP02 Recla, who was designated to act as poseur-buyer, approached appellant Ponsica and told the latter that he wanted to "score" two hundred pesos (P200.00) worth of <u>shabu</u>. SPO2 Recla then handed Ponsica two marked one hundred peso bills which had been initialed by SP01 Sultan. Appellant accepted the money and then left for a while. When appellant returned, he gave SPO2 Recla a small package wrapped in brown paper. SPO2 Recla examined the package and upon finding that it contained <u>shabu</u>, immediately tapped the right side of his head, the prearranged signal that the sale had been consummated. The back-up persons consisting of SPO2 Mohammadshaid and SPO1 Sultan approached them and arrested Ponsica. The marked money was promptly recovered by SPO1 Sultan from the right pocket of Ponsica's maong pants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The seized <u>shabu</u> (Exhibit "C") was taken to the PNP Crime Laboratory where PNP Inspector Myrna Areola, Chief of the Chemistry Section, examined and analyzed the material. She found that the white crystalline substance weighing about one (1) gram, subject of this indictment, consisted of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a regulated drug also known as <u>shabu</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Appellant Ponsica sought to counter the prosecution's view of the incident by presenting his own version which was reported by the trial court as follows:<br><blockquote>"On 4 January 1992, at about 10:00 a.m., he went to see his father in Talamban, Cebu City to ask money for his sick child. As his father was not home, he went to his mother at Carbon Market, Cebu City for the same purpose. She gave him P200.00. He also ate lunch at his mother's place.</blockquote>After lunch, he went to a store to buy softdrinks. At the store a certain person — who turned out to be SPO2 Hermes Recla — approached him if he knew a certain Cesar who was living nearby, and he answered in the negative. Nonetheless, Recla insisted that he look for Cesar because Recla wanted to buy a certain stone ('bato') from Cesar. Recla promised to give him P50.00 if he could locate Cesar and buy for him (Recla) that bato from Cesar.<br><br>With the help of a young man who directed him to where Cesar was, he succeeded in locating Cesar 'beside the house'.<br><br>Upon meeting Cesar for the first time, Cesar asked who the person looking for him was. Ponsica replied that the man was outside 'at the store where I bought softdrink and where that man also took softdrink.'<br><br>After that, Cesar gave me something, a small pack' which was wrapped in brown paper and which he carried in his hands.<br><br>Upon delivery of that small pack to Recla, the latter, instead of giving him the P50.00 which he promised, held him by the shoulder, and Recla and two of his companions placed him under arrest, frisked him, removed his shorts and took away his belt and his wallet with the photograph of his wife, and the sum of P215.00 which he had with him at the time. The wallet and its contents were never returned to him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The single error assigned by appellant is that:<br><blockquote>"The lower court erred in finding that there was a buy-bust operation and in finding the accused guilty."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></blockquote>Ponsica pleads instigation as a defense. He claims that the procedure adopted by the Narcom agents on 4 January 1992 did not constitute a "buy-bust" operation where there is a simultaneous giving of marked money by the poseur-buyer and handing over of the drugs by the pusher, popularly known as "<u>kaliwaan</u>." Appellant stresses that he had merely acted as an errand boy in the transaction and prays for acquittal.<br><br>The Court notes that Ponsica had previously been placed under surveillance by the Narcom agents on the information that Ponsica had been selling shabu in the Carbon Market area. The arresting officers had identified and witnessed appellant engaged in the sale of material believed to be <u>shabu</u> three (3) days before the "buy-bust" operation was actually mounted. In short, the 4 January 1992 "buy-bust" operation was designed to catch Ponsica <u>in flagrante delicto</u> and to arrest him.<br><br>The record shows that SP02 Recla, posing as a buyer, did not induce appellant to commit the crime charged. Ponsica had been observed openly selling <u>shabu</u> days before his arrest and needed no prodding from the police authorities. SP02 Recla's testimony, in relevant part, follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">"Q — </td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">How did you know that he was engaged in that business when you saw him for the first time seated by the store and all of a sudden you further said, 'Pare, I wanted to scure a shabu (sic).'</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A —</td> <td> <div align="justify">We are basing the complaint of the parents in that area.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">xxx xxx xxx</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">ATTY.

It is also important to note that Ponsica's arrest was the sole purpose of the buy-bust operation, being the "main target" of the Narcom agents<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and Ponsica admitted before the trial court that he had delivered the package containing <u>shabu</u> to SPO2 Recla.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The foregoing facts alone prove the completion of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Appellant denies having received any money from SPO2 Recla and claims that what was recovered from him was not the marked money consisting of two (2) one hundred peso (P100.00) bills but the two hundred pesos his mother had given him with which to buy medicine for his sick child. This assertion was controverted by the straightforward testimony of SP02 Recla which was corroborated by SPO1 Sultan:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">"Q — </td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">How much was the marked money handed by you to him?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A — </td> <td> <div align="justify">Two hundred pesos (P200.00).</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q —</td> <td> <div align="justify">Did he receive?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A&nbsp; —</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Sir.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">XXX XXX XXX</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q —</td> <td> <div align="justify">Who was able to recover the marked money?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A —</td> <td> <div align="justify">Sgt.

He maintains that he had with him a total of two hundred and fifteen pesos (P215.00) which was taken by the police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> However, Ponsica also stated that the two hundred pesos (P200.00) his mother had given him consisted of one fifty peso (P50.00) bill and five twenty peso (P20.00) bills. Aside from this, appellant said he had fifteen pesos (P15.00) pocket money.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> But this adds up to one hundred sixty five pesos (P165.00) only. This appears to be a transparent and vain attempt on the part of Ponsica to overcome the testimony to the effect that marked money had been recovered from him.<br><br>Ponsica next claims that he got the package allegedly containing the <u>shabu</u> from a certain Cesar whom he found beside the latter's house. Appellant's claim, however, was rebutted by the following testimony of SP01 Sultan:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">"Q — </td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Yes, but when Ponsica left the place to get the stock, you lost sight of him.

He just immediately entered the house.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">xxx xxx xxx</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>Q — </td> <td> <div align="justify"><u>From the place where Recla was until he (Ponsica) entered the house, you never lost sight of him.

Appellant himself admitted before the trial court that he had no misunderstanding or trouble of any kind with SPO2 Recla or SPO1 Sultan at any time prior to his arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> In the absence of proof of any intent on the part of the police authorities falsely to impute such a serious crime against appellant, the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty as well as the principle that findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect, must prevail over the self-serving and uncorroborated claim of appellant that he had been "framed".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly rejected Ponsica's claim that he had obtained the <u>shabu</u> from one Cesar, who, in Ponsica's story, was the real vendor of the shabu. Ponsica never proved the existence of Cesar; he did not present Cesar as a witness nor did he seek to compel his attendance by subpoena.<br><br>Ponsica's assertion that he thought that the "bato" which SPO2 Recla wanted was a real stone or a gemstone and not <u>shabu</u>, was also rejected by the trial court and, we believe, rightly so. SPO2 Recla testified before the trial court that he told Ponsica that he wanted "to score a <u>Shabu</u>".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> This was corroborated by SPO1 Sultan who also testified that he positively heard SPO2 Recla tell Ponsica that he, (SPO2 Recla) wanted "to score a <u>shabu</u>".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> It is widely known that "to score" means to buy in the common parlance of the drug trade.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> By the use of the word "<u>shabu</u>”, it is clear that SPO2 Recla was referring to the drug, nothing else.<br><br>Finally, Ponsica maintains that because there was no simultaneous delivery of the <u>shabu</u> and payment for the drug or "<u>kaliwaan</u>", the operation conducted on 4 January 1992 which led to his arrest, was not a "buy-bust" or entrapment operation. We do not agree. There is no fixed procedure for conducting "buy-bust" operations and no rule of law requires the simultaneous exchange of the marked money and the prohibited or regulated drug between the poseur-buyer and the pusher or seller.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The well-entrenched principle is that the crime of illegal sale is committed as soon as the sale transaction is consummated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>, whether payment precedes or follows delivery of the drug sold. Finally, the records show no irregularity in the conduct of the "buy-bust" operation which would in any way exculpate the accused.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> for all the foregoing, the decision of the trial court is hereby AFFIRMED in its entirety.
