and '7' together with Exhibits '6-A', '6-1' and '7-A', '7-1', are contracts of
civil law lease, under the <span style="">provisions
of the Civil Code, thus, the relationship created by the plaintiff Francisco <span class="SpellE">Novesteras</span> and Fabio Ramos over the land­holding in
question is purely of a civil law lease contract under the Civil Code and not
under the provisions of Rep. Act No. 1199 and Rep. Act No. 3844, hence, there

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts of the case are
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner was share
tenant of <span class="GramE">private</span> Respondent over two parcels of land
situated in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bawa</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Gerona</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> with an
area of 3.3491 ha. <span class="GramE">more</span> or less, for one agricultural
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the end of such year,
Respondent entered into a contract with <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span> denominated as a contract of civil lease over the
same parcels of land for the following crop year for a consideration of P1<span class="GramE">,400.00</span> in cash (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"5").<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span>
did not farm the land himself but left it to Petitioner to till the land as his
tenant, planting <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and sugar on it during said
crop year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the expiration of the
contract between Respondent and <span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span>, the latter
surrendered the landholding to Respondent after which a three-year contract,
renewable for another three years, depending upon the will of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, was entered into between Petitioner and Respondent,
also denominated as contract of civil lease over the same parcels of land, in
consi­deration of which Petitioner was to pay Respondent 60 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>
of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> of first class variety, such as BE-E, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Co</span>ncehala</span> or
<span class="SpellE">wagwag</span>, <span class="SpellE">dikit</span>, <span class="SpellE">raminad</span>, </span><span style="">etc.,
</span><span style="">47 kilos per <span class="SpellE"><span style="">cavan</span></span><span style=""> or its equivalent </span>in cash <span style="">at
the rate of P20.00 a </span><span class="SpellE">cavan</span>, not later than
February 14 of each <span style="">year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioner </span>was to shoulder the
irrigation fee (Exhibit "6").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appears that Petitioner gave as security a certain parcel of land
under Declaration No. 1234 situated at <span class="SpellE">Dawa</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Gerona</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, to answer
for any failure on his part to pay the rentals plus 12% interest a month (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"6-A", <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. <span style="">5).</span></span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The lease was renewed for another three
agricultural years, renewable for another term of three years (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "7").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, respondent informed petitioner in a letter that the former was
no longer amenable to a renewal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Immediately after the
expiration of the contract, Respondent entered and plowed the land by tractor
and planted 1-1/2 has. <span class="GramE">of</span> the land with sugar cane
shoots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also planted sugar
cane on a portion of the land plowed by Respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus in another letter, Respondent reminded
Petitioner of the expiration of their contract of lease and that the latter had
nothing more to do with the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent reiterated that he was against renewal of the lease for
another three years (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "9").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner eventually
filed an action in the Court of Agrarian Relations of <span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, for the main­tenance of the plaintiff
(Petitioner herein) by the defendant (private Respondent herein) in the
peaceful possession and enjoyment of the two parcels of land in question with a
prayer that pending the litigation an </span>interlocutory order be issued for
the purpose (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, on the other hand, filed a motion
with the same court for the issuance of an interlocutory order enjoining
Petitioner from entering the land and maintaining him in the possession of the
land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his Answer with
counterclaim, filed with the Court of Agrarian Relations, Respondent prayed
that judgment be rendered declaring the contract between Petitioner and
Respondent one of civil law lease and therefore said Court had no jurisdiction
over the case, ordering the plaintiff to pay to the defendant P2,000.00 as
moral damages and P500.00 as attorney's fees, on the basis of defendant's
counterclaim; and maintaining the possession of the defendant over the
landholdings in question (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Agrarian Relations issued an
Order declaring the contract between Petitioner and Respondent as a contract of
civil law lease and dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 23).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
appeal, res­pondent Court affirmed the Order of the trial court in its decision
with the following <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion -</p>

appealed from, we hereby AFFIRM the same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The sole issue that must
be resolved by the Court is the question of whether or not agricultural tenancy
rela­tionship was established between the Petitioner and the Respondent in
relation to the landholding in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The answer is in the
affirmative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is undisputed that
during the original agricultu­ral year, Petitioner was share tenant of
Respondent (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 19) but respondent claims that
at the end of the agricultural year, Petitioner returned the land</span><span style="">holding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is, however, denied by Petitioner who testified during the hearing
of the case in the Court </span>of Agrarian Relations that from the time he
began to work on the landholding during the Japanese Occupation up to the time
when the relationship between him and respondent was changed to leasehold, he
continuously worked on the landholding in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span>
who testified that he did not farm the land himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just after the execution of the contract
between him and Respondent, Petitioner told him that he (Petitioner) would be
the one to till the <span style="">land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In fact, Petitioner worked on,
cultivated and planted on the landholding and harvest­ed the crops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it is highly improbable that
Petitioner who had been working on the land throughout the years would
voluntarily return the land to his land­lord to be given to a civil lessee, and
then ask the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to <span style="">be </span>allowed to till the landholding in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With the advent of the
Agricultural Land Reform Code the share tenancy relationship between Petitioner
and Respondent had to end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
replaced by agricultural leasehold </span><span style="">tenancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The
Code provides that "where the agricultural share tenancy has ceased to be
operative by virtue of this <span class="GramE">Code.</span> . . and the tenant
continues in possession of the land for cultivation, there shall be presumed to
exist a leasehold relationship under </span>the provisions of this
Code..." (Sec. 4, Republic Act No. 3844).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such leasehold relation with Respondent conferred upon Petitioner the
right to continue working on the landholding until the leasehold relation is
extinguished and it entitled him to security of tenure on the landholding such
that he cannot be ejected <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> unless authorized
by the Court for causes provided in the Code (Sec. 7 of the Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tenants are guaranteed security of tenure, <span style="">meaning </span>the continued enjoyment and
possession of their landholding except when their dispossession has been
authorized by virtue of a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
judgment (<span class="SpellE">Catorce</span> v. Court of Appeals, 129 SCRA 210
[1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Assuming, for the sake of
argument, however, that </span>Petitioner, <span style="">ignorant </span>of his rights under the then newly passed Agricultural
Land Reform Code, returned the land­holding to Respondent, nevertheless, it is
undisputed that Petitioner was instituted as tenant over the same landholding
by <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span> with
whom Respondent had entered into a contract of civil law lease (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "5").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even after the expiration of the lease agreement between Respondent and <span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span> and the return of the landholding to Respondent,
the security of tenure of Petitioner as tenant over the landholding remained
secure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Joya</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>, 106 Phil. 645
(1959) which also involves a civil law lease of agricultural land, the Court
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"It is our considered judgment, since the return by the lessee
of the leased property to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> upon the
expiration of the contract involves also a transfer of legal possession, and
taking into account <span style="">the manifest intent
of the lawmaking body in amending the law, i.e., to provide the tenant with
security of tenure in all cases of transfer of legal possession, that the
instant case falls within and is governed by the provisions of Section 9 of
Republic Act 1199, as amended by Republic Act 2263.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The termination of the leas<span style="">e</span>, therefore, did not divest the
tenant of the right to remain on and continue his cultivation of the
land."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Agricultural Tenancy Act of 1954
(Republic Act 1199), the Agricultural Land Reform Code of 1963 (Republic Act
3844), the Code of Agrarian Reforms (Republic Act 6389), all provide for the
security of tenure of agricultural tenants (Guerrero <span style="">v. </span>Court of Appeals, 142 SCRA 136
[1986]; <span class="SpellE">Aisporna</span> v. CA, 108 SCRA 481 [1981]; <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Servidad</span>, 107 SCRA
276 [1981]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Already
enjoying security of tenure as share tenant of Respondent before the approval
of the Agricultural Land Reform Code and as tenant of <span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span>,
notwithstand­ing, Petitioner entered into a lease </span><span style="">contract </span><span style="">with Respondent for a period of three agricultural years (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">"6") which was renewed for another three agricultural
years (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "7" and
"7-J"), denominated as contract of civil law lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court rightly cited the case of <span class="SpellE">Japitana</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> (90 Phil.
750 [1952]) wherein the Court ruled:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"that the juridical character of the relationship between the
appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should not be determined
by the term used to describe such relationship" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 43).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It nonetheless erroneously
concluded that the contracts of lease between Petitioner-Respondent was a civil
law lease based <span style="">on </span>its
observation that Plaintiff simply stepped into the shoes of <span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span>
in the latter's capacity as mere <span style="">lessee </span>of the landholding and voluntarily
changing his status from tenant to mere civil law lessee (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 45).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court agreed with the
court <u>a</u> <span class="GramE"><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(</span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 100).</p>

<p class="BODY">Be it noted that, as ruled by the Supreme Court, the title, label
or rubric given to a contract cannot be used to camouflage the real import of
an agreement as evinced by its main provisions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it is basic that a contract is what the law defines it to <span class="GramE">be,</span> and not what it is called by the contracting
parties" (<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>,
27 SCRA 7 [1969], citing <span class="SpellE">Quiroga</span> v. Parsons Hardware
Co., 38 Phil. 501).</p>

<p class="BODY">A tenant is defined under Section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 1199
as a person who, himself, and with the aid available from within his immediate
household, culti­vates the land belonging to or possessed by another, with the
latter's consent for purposes of production, sharing the produce with the
landholder under the share tenancy system, or paying to the landholder a price
certain or ascertainable in produce or in money or both, <span style="">under </span>the leasehold tenancy system (<span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Servidad</span>, 107 SCRA
276 [1981]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has synthesized
the principal elements of a leasehold tenancy contract or relation as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) The object of the contract
or the relationship is an agricultural land which is leased or rented for the
purpose of agricultural production; (2) the size of the landholding must be
such <span style="">that </span>it is susceptible of
personal cultivation by a single person with assistance from the members of his
immediate farm household; (3) the tenant-lessee must actually and per­sonally
till, cultivate or operate said land, solely or with the aid of labor from his
immediate farm household; and (4) the landlord-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
who is either the lawful owner or the legal possessor of the land, leases the
same to the tenant lessee for a price certain or ascertainable either in an
amount of money or produce (<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>, 27 SCRA 7 [1969]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no doubt that
the contract between Respon­dent and <span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span> is not
a leasehold tenancy contract </span>as it does not fulfill the requirements of
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Porlucas</span> <span style="">never had the intention of cultivating the
landholding <span class="GramE">personally,</span> in fact, Petitioner cultivated
the land as his tenant (TSN, July 17, 1971, pp. 21, 26).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The con­tracts entered into between
Petitioner and Respondent are of a different nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner leased the land­holding for the
purpose of agricultural production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was a farmer and had no need for the landholding except to cultivate it as he
had done in the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, </span>that
must have been the expectation also of Respondent in requiring Petitioner to
pay for the rental 60 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
of first class variety such as BE-3, <span class="SpellE">Concehala</span> or <span class="SpellE">Wagwag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Diket</span> or <span class="SpellE">Raminad</span> (TSN, July 17, 1971, p. 38).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner personally cultivated the land; he
never allowed somebody else to work on the landholding (TSN, July 17, 1971, p.
43).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The consideration was in an
ascertainable amount, 60 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> during each agri­cultural year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Both contracts (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">"6" and <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> "7" and "7-J") satisfy the
basic requirements of an agricultural leasehold tenancy contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, being a <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> tenant-lessee, is entitled to invoke the secu­rity
of tenure guaranteed by the Agricultural Tenancy Law (R.A. 1199), the
Agricultural Land Reform Code (R.A. 3844), which security has not been
abolished by the Code of Agrarian Reforms or R.A. 6389 (<span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Servidad</span>, 107 SCRA 276 [1981]; <span class="SpellE">Aisporma</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 108 SCRA 481 [1981]; Guerrero v. Court of Appeals, 142
SCRA 136 [1986]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The status of
Petitioner as tenant-lessee is thus established on three counts, as
existing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is still in
possession of the landholding in question (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
24).</p>
