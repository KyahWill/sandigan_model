bag or sack and kept the same in the depository or bodega of the cemetery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the same lot in question was

advised to do was simply unacceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to her, it was just impossible to locate the remains of her
late husband in a depository containing thousands upon thousands of sacks of
human bones.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not want to run the
risk of claiming for the wrong set of bones.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

experience of private respondents and their wounded feelings upon discovery
that the remains of their loved one were exhumed without their knowledge and
consent, as said Court declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It has been fully established that the appellants, in spite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">or </span>perhaps because, of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their lowly station in life have found great
consolation in their bereavement from the loss of their family head, by
visiting his grave on special or even ordinary occasions, but particularly on
All Saints Day, in keeping with the deep, beautiful and Catholic Filipino
tradition of revering the memory of their dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It would have been but fair and equitable that they were notified of the
intention of the city government to transfer the skeletal remains of the late <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo to give
them an opportunity to demand the faithful fulfillment of their contract, or at
least to prepare and make provisions for said transfer in order that they would
not lose track of the remains of their beloved dead, as what has actually
happened on this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We understand
fully what the family of the deceased must have felt when on All Saints Day of
1978, they found a new marker on the grave they were to visit, only to be told
to locate their beloved dead among thousands of skeletal remains which to them <span class="GramE">was</span> desecration and an impossible task.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the lower court recognized this when it
stated in its decision thus:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘All things considered, even as the Court commiserates with
plaintiffs for the unfortunate happening complained of and untimely desecration
of the resting place and remains of their deceased dearly beloved, it finds the
<span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for by them lacking in legal and
factual basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the aforementioned
facts and circumstances, the most that plaintiffs can ask for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>the replacement of subject lot with
another lot of equal size and similar location in the North <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Cemetery which substitute lot plaintiffs can
make use of without paying any rental to the city government for a period of
forty-three (43) years, four (4) months and eleven (11) days corresponding to
the unexpired portion of the term of the lease sued upon as of January 25, 1978
when the remains of the late <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo, Sr. <span class="GramE">were</span> prematurely
removed from the disputed lot; and to require the defendants to look in earnest
for the bones and skull of the late <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="GramE">Domingo Sr. and to bury the same in
the substitute lot adjudged in favor of plaintiffs hereunder.’"</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
