against his supervisors in their absence but promptly reported to them, private
respondent Gregorio Gale, a roomboy at the five-star Century Park Sheraton
Manila owned and operated by petitioner Maranaw Hotels and Resorts Corporation,
was dismissed for "discourtesy and use of disrespectful and impolite
language against a superior which constitutes gross misconduct."</p>

Arbitrator finds no evidence that there was fighting, nor challenging to a
fight, no assaulting nor intimidation of co-employees or supervisors within the
hotel premises.  What was established as
per evidence on record was more of discourtesy, and use of disrespectful and
impolite language uttered by complainant which falls under Section 2, Rule VI
of the Rules of the Hotel and carries the penalty of 7 days of suspension for
first offense.  The evidence shows it
was a first offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Arbitrator finds and so holds
that complainant Gregorio Gale has violated Section 2, Rule VI of the Rules of
the Hotel and orders his suspension for a period of seven (7) days.  However, as per admission of the parties,
Mr. Gale has already been dismissed.  In
case complainant Mr. Gale has been out of his job as roomboy of the Hotel for
more than that period of 7 days, his immediate reinstatement is hereby ordered
with right to collect his share in the service charge."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

alleging that respondent appellate court erred in not imposing the penalty of
dismissal upon private respondent considering that he was found guilty of gross
misconduct, and in allowing him to collect his share in the service charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition should have been dismissed outright for We see no
reason to reverse the appellate court in its finding that there was no grave
abuse of discretion<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>on the part

<p class="BODY">As in the case of a labor arbiter, the conclusions of a voluntary
arbitrator, when they are sufficiently corroborated by the evidence on record,
should similarly be respected by appellate tribunals since he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is also </span>in a vantage position to
assess and evaluate the credibility of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the</span>
contending parties.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have also emphasized the rule that decisions of voluntary
arbitrators are final and unappealable except when there is want of
jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">violation
of due process, denial of substantial justice, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

before Us.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the discharge of an employee who uttered unfelicitous
remarks against his supervisors, in general, for strictly enforcing company
rules against union members, but who thereafter apologized, is too harsh.  We have held time and again that it is cruel
and unjust to mete out the drastic penalty of dismissal if it is not proximate
to the gravity of the misdeed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> The

is that -</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(W)here a penalty less punitive would
suffice, whatever missteps may be committed by labor ought not to be visited
with a consequence so </span>severe.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is not only because of the law's concern
for the workingman.  There is, in
addition, his family to consider.  Unemployment brings untold hardships and sorrows on those dependent on
the wage-earner.  The misery and pain
attendant on the loss of jobs then could be avoided if there be acceptance of
the view that under all circumstances of this case, petitioners should not be
deprived of their means of livelihood.  Nor is this to condone what had been done by them x x x x.  From the strictly juridical standpoint, it
cannot be too strongly stressed, to follow Davis in his masterly work,
Discretionary Justice, that where a decision may be made to rest on informed
judgment rather than rigid rules, all the equities of the case must be accorded
their due weight.  Finally, labor law
determinations, to quote from Bultmann, should be not only </span><i>secundum
rationem </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">but also </span><i>secundum
</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">caritatem.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in<i> Foodmine, Incorporated v. NLRC</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
We ruled that granting that the unsubstantiated claims of a co­-employee that
she was slapped on the cheek and thereafter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">her </span>left breast grabbed and pulled were true, the penalty of
removal from employment was not commensurate to the misconduct allegedly
committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Rubberworld (Phil.), Inc. v. NLRC</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
We said that assuming that private respondent posted entries in the stock cards
without counter-checking the actual movement status of the items in the
warehouse, thereby resulting in unmanageable inaccuracies in the data posted in
the stock cards, his dismissal was not justified as he did not appear to be an
incorrigible offender nor did his negligence cause serious damage to the
company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then in <i>PT &amp; T v. NLRC</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> We
held that even considering that there may have been valid grounds for private
respondent's discharge, the imposition of such supreme penalty would certainly
be very harsh and disproportionate to the infraction committed, specially since
it was his first offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar is akin to the aforementioned cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with petitioner's submission that private
respondent's reinstatement will not conduce to industrial peace and harmony in
the hotel due to strained relations.  Simply, the cases cited by petitioner are misplaced.  We are not unmindful of the "strained
relations" brought about by the filing of the case and the underlying
causes.  Indeed, relations may have
become acrimonious and hostile.  However, the doctrine of strained relations cannot be applied with
impunity lest We trifle with the rights of wage earners by authorizing
management to indiscriminately dismiss them and thereafter provide the employer
with the convenient and ready excuse not to reinstate them.  On the contrary, We have to exercise extreme
caution in this regard.  As the Court
reasoned in <i>Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Corporation v. NLRC</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
-</p>

<blockquote>"Obviously, the principle of ‘strained relations’ cannot be
applied indiscriminately.  Otherwise,
reinstatement can never be possible simply because some hostility is invariably
engendered between the parties as a result of litigation.  That is human nature."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, "strained relations" may be invoked only
against employees whose positions demand trust and confidence, or whose
differences with their employer are of such nature or degree as to preclude
reinstatement.  In the instant case,
however, the relationship between private respondent, a roomboy, and management
was clearly on an impersonal level.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> Gale
did not occupy such a sensitive position as would require complete trust and
confidence, where personal ill will would preclude his reinstatement.  Hence, in <i>Panday v. NLRC</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
We ruled that "[i]f the respondent had been a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">laborer, clerk or other rank-and-file employee, </span>there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">would be no problem in ordering her
reinstatement with facility." Neither is the enmity of </span>such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">degree as to prevent private respondent’s
reinstatement.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not concur with petitioner that private respondent is not
entitled to his share <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in the service </span>charge.  As pointed out by the Court of Appeals, that
private respondent was entitled to his share in the service charge collected
during the period he was illegally dismissed finds support <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">in </span>the provisions of their collective
bargaining agreement.  Hence, We will
not disturb this factual finding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Interestingly, however, petitioner alleges that private
respondent continued to receive his monthly salary from his dismissal on 4
December 1987 to 15 January 1992, which amounted to a total of P76,598.46,
conformably with their agreement "concluded between the Hotel and the
Union so that the Union may withdraw <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">its
</span>notice of strike from the Department of Labor and Employment and not go
on strike,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
notwithstanding the fact that shortly after his separation he joined the Armed
Forces of the Philippines from which he also received remuneration.  This allegation does not only remain
unrefuted but is, in fact, implicitly admitted by private respondent in his
pleadings filed with respondent court.  By his implied admission, private respondent, thus, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">acknowledges that he received double
compensation, which may also explain why the Voluntary Arbitrator, after
ordering the former’s reinstatement, did not rule on the payment of
backwages.  The matter of double
compensation cannot be countenanced - not because We fault private respondent </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">not remaining idle during the pendency of his case - but because he
should not be allowed to unjustly enrich himself at the expense of petitioner
who continues to pay his salary despite his dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span><i>PAL v.
PALEA</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
We concluded that under the principle that no one should be permitted to
feather his nest to the disadvantage of another, and proceeding from the law's
traditional aversion to double payment, it is neither fair nor just that the
reinstated workers who have not rendered any service to the employer, who
apparently dismissed them in good faith, should receive relatively sizeable
amounts in backwages, and at the same time keep the salary and other monetary
benefits they had earned elsewhere during their layoff which they could not
have obtained had they remained in the employ of their employer.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In </span><i>Itogon-Suyoc

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We restated these guidelines -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"First.  To be deducted
from the back wages accruing to each of the laborers to be reinstated is the
total amount of earnings obtained by him from other employment(s) from the date
of reinstatement.  Should the laborer
decide that it is preferable not to return to work, the deduction should be
made up to the time judgment becomes final.  And these, for the reason that employees should not be permitted to
enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.  Besides, there is the law’s abhorrence for double compensation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Second.  Likewise, in
mitigation of the damages that the dismissed respondents are entitled to,
account should be taken of whether in the exercise of due diligence respondents
might have obtained income from suitable remunerative employment.  We are prompted to give out this last
reminder because it is really unjust that a discharged employee should, with
folded arms, remain inactive in the expectation that a windfall would come to
him.  A contrary view would breed
idleness; it is conducive to lack of initiative on the part of a laborer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We reiterated the principle against unjust enrichment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">East Asiatic Co., Ltd. v. </span>CIR</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> -</p>

<blockquote>"In other words, the just and equitable rule regarding the
point under discussion is this:  It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>the obligation of the employer to
pay an illegally dismissed employee or worker the whole amount of the salaries
or wages, plus all other benefits and bonuses and general increases, to which
he would have been normally entitled had he not been dismissed and had not
stopped working, but it is the right, on the other hand, of the employer to
deduct from the total of these, the amount equivalent to the salaries or wages
the employee or worker would have earned in his old employment on the
corresponding days that he was actually gainfully employed elsewhere with an
equal or higher salary or wage, such that if his salary or wage in his other
employment was less, the employer may deduct only what has been actually
earned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Although the principle
that no one should be allowed to enrich himself at the expense of another has
thus far endured, We have, however, modified the rule.  In the course of time We have adopted the
policy of fixing the amount of backwages at a just and reasonable level without
qualification or deduction so as to free the employees from the burden of
proving their earnings during their layoffs and the employer from submitting
counter proofs and thus obviate the twin evils of idleness on the part of

<p class="BODY">In the case before Us, since the illegal dismissal of private
respondent occurred on 4 December 1987, or before R.A. 6715 took effect on 21
March 1989, he is entitled only to three (3) years' backwages, inclusive of all
allowances and other benefits, without deducting any remunerations he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">may </span>have received as member of the
Armed Forces of the Philippines, or from any other employment, and not to his
full wages from the time he was dismissed up to the present.  Certainly, private respondent<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>cannot be allowed to receive salary
from petitioner for the whole duration that he was not working as roomboy by
reason of his unjust dismissal, while at the same time, draw compensation as
member of the Armed Forces of the Philippines<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>which would not have been possible had he continued to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">work </span>for petitioner; for that would be
unjust enrichment.  Consequently, if<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>private respondent already received
more than<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>what he is entitled to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in accordance</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">herewith, he should
reimburse petitioner such </span>amount in excess of what is due him; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">otherwise, petitioner </span>should make good
the corresponding deficiency.</p>
