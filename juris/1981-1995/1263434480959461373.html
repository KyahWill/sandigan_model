Accused-appellant Victor F. Oliver is now in jail awaiting the outcome of the
instant appeal from a judgment of conviction rendered by the Regional Trial
Court of the Fourth Judicial Region (Branch XXV, Biñan, Laguna) in Criminal
Case No. 3926-B finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (p. 10, Decision; p. 21, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The following antecedent facts find support in the record:</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 29, 1985, at about 11:00 o'clock in the morning, Rowena de
los Santos, after asking permission from her mother to watch television, went
to the house of accused-appellant which is just adjacent to their house.  There were also other houses surrounding
their houses.  At the time, the only
persons in the house were the victim and accused-appellant.  While they were watching television,
accused-appellant suddenly held both hands of complainant with his left hand
and forcibly pulled her to the upper floor of his house, while her mouth was
covered by accused-appellant's right hand.  Upon reaching the upper floor, accused-appellant released his right hand
from the mouth of the victim and got hold of a pair of scissors from a small
table.  Complainant could not struggle
and shout for help even if her mother was then in their house nearby because of
accused-appellant's threats to kill her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, accused-appellant took off Rowena's clothes and her
panties and touched her private part while at the same time threatening to kill
complainant if she resisted, and telling her to "pagbigyan mo
ako".  He went on top of her and
inserted his penis into her private part while his hands were fully pressed on
her hands.  After about ten minutes,
accused-appellant pulled out his penis and asked Rowena to put on her clothes
and told her to go home.  She did not
report immediately the incident to her mother nor to anybody for fear for her
life.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rufina Almira de los Santos, mother of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">victim, </span>testified that at about 12:00
o'clock noon of that day, Rowena went home but she noticed that Rowena was walking
with her two legs apart.  Rufina then
asked her daughter about the latter's unusual way of walking, but Rowena
replied that she was having her menstruation.  On the third day, Rufina noticed that Rowena was bleeding profusely and
there were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">blood </span>clots coming
out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>her private part, so
Rufina brought Rowena to the Beato-Cauilan Clinic.  After the examination, Dr. Paciencia Beato-Cauilan, an
obstetrician at the clinic, told Rufina that Rowena was used <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">('ginamit').  </span>Then and there, Rufina confronted Rowena in front of the doctor
and Rowena admitted that she was indeed used by accused-appellant.  Rowena told her mother that she was afraid
to reveal what had happened because she was threatened by accused-appellant.  From the clinic, mother and daughter proceeded
to the Sta. Rosa Police Station where their statements were taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Paciencia Beato-Cauilan's testimony, on the other hand, is to
the effect that the physical examination of Rowena revealed that there were
hymenal lacerations of the vagina.  She
further said that something had forcibly entered the vagina so she advised the
patient to go to the National Bureau of Investigation for further
examination.  However, no written report
of the examination was prepared <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as the
examination was just a mere slight pelvic check-over which took about five to
ten minutes to finish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In addition, Major Dario
L. Gajardo, a Medico-Legal Officer of the PC Crime Laboratory at Camp Crame,
also testified that he conducted a physical examination of the victim.  In his written Medical-Legal Report No.
N-1861-85 dated June 27, 1985, he declared that based on the examination
conducted, there were deep and shallow but healed lacerations in the hymen of
the victim and there were also injuries in the labia menora.  He further testified that vaginal smears are
positive for sexually transmitted disease (Gonorrhea) but negative for
spermatozoa.  He concluded that the
lacerations were caused by sexual intercourse and that the victim, at the time of
the examination, was already in a non-virgin state</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">s </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">physically.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(pp. 2-3, Appellant's Brief, pp. 29-30,
Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">After a careful review of
the records, We are convinced that, indeed, accused-appellant had raped
complainant with the use of force and intimidation at the time and place and in
the manner described by the latter.  Verily, while both of them were watching television at the ground floor
of the two-storey house of accused-appellant, the latter suddenly grabbed
complainant and dragged her to the second floor of the house (TSN, June 29,
1987, </span>pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">16, 19-20).  Upon reaching the upper floor of the house,
accused-appellant threatened to kill complainant with a pair of scissors, which
he got from a table, if the complainant does not accede to accused-appellant's
libidinous desire (TSN, June 29, 1987, pp. 5, 21).  Facing possible death, the minor Rowena inevitably gave in to the
salacious desire of the accused-appellant.  We can understand the meek reaction of Rowena to that harrowing
experience of </span>hers even when <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
</span>defense claims that she should have shouted for help.  Rowena, it is to be stressed, was just over
12 years old at the time of the commission of rape, an age at which one could
easily be cowed and coerced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the trial court erred in finding that there was violence
in the commission of the felony, yet, force and intimidation were definitely
employed, enough to constitute the crime committed, as rape.  Intimidation includes the moral kind, such
as the fear caused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by threatening the
girl with a knife (2 <u>Cuello Calon</u>, Codigo P</span>enal, 12th Edition, p.
537; <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">People vs. Garcines</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>57 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">653  [1974]).  In the case at bar, rape was </span>committed
when intimidation was used on the victim and the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">submitted against her will because of fear for her </span>life and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">personal safety </span>(<u>Peop</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">le</span> vs. Arengo</u>, 181 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">SCRA </span>344 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, We cannot fault the victim for the delay in reporting
that odious and despicable incident.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">One can not expect </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">12-year old girl to act like an adult or a mature
and experienced woman </span>who would have the courage and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">intelligence to disregard </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">threat to her life and complain </span>immediately
that she had been forcibly sexually assaulted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">(<u>People </u></span><u>vs. Tampus</u>, 88 SCRA 217 [1979]).  Accordingly, the delay in divulging her
incubus to the doctor, and who in turn told it to her mother, is understandable
and was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sufficiently </span>explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant asseverates that the testimony of the
complaining <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">witness </span>was not
plausible, satisfactory, and sincere since there were inconsistencies in her
testimony in open court <u>vis</u>-<u>a</u>-<u>vis</u> her sworn statement made
at the police station.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies referred to by the accused-appellant
in his brief concern only trivial, minor, and insignificant details.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant points to a supposed inconsistency between
complainant's testimony that she was raped in her house on May 29, 1985 (TSN,
June 29, 1987, p. 3) and her sworn statement made at the police station that she
was raped at accused-appellant's house (Sworn Statement, p. 2; Original Record,
p. 3).  He further avers that if
complainant was indeed raped in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">her </span>house,
it would be unnatural <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>accused-appellant
to have subsequently asked her to go home.  Nevertheless, it is clear enough from the testimony of Rowena that the
rape took place in the house of accused-appellant, and the inconsistency with
her previous statement given at the police station was explained, thus:</p>

talked about in public.  Under </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">such </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant also contends that there was inconsistency
between the testimony of complaining witness in open court that he was armed
with a pair of scissors and the sworn statement of the former executed at the
police station that at the time of the commission of the crime,
accused-appellant was unarmed, which would otherwise belie and impugn the
findings of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that rape was committed with the use
of a deadly weapon.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.  As
eloquently explained by Justice Leo Medialdea in <u>Biala vs. Court of Appeals</u>,
191 SCRA 50 (1990):</p>

<blockquote>“... it is settled that contradictions made between averments in a
sworn statement and those made during testi­mony in open court may be explained

incorrect­ly describe some the material occurrences narrated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is a time-honored tenet as this Court has repeatedly ruled
that the findings of facts of trial judge who tried the case and heard the
witnesses, should not be disturbed on appeal and should be given considerable
weight and respect, especially on the credibility of witnesses, since he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>a better position to decide the
question, having heard and observed the demeanor, attitude, conduct and
deportment of witnesses (<u>People vs. Dilao</u>, et al., 100 SCRA 358 [1980]; <u>People
vs. Cabrera</u>, 100 SCRA 424 [1980]; <u>People vs. Badeo</u>, 204 SCRA 122
[1991]; <u>People vs. Honrada</u>, 204 SCRA 858 [1991]; <u>People vs. Atilano</u>,
204 SCRA 278 [1991]; <u>People vs. Lardizabal</u>, 204 SCRA 320 [1991]; <u>People
vs. Lee</u>, 204 SCRA 900 [1991]).  The
only exception to the rule is when a trial judge has plainly overlooked
substantial facts and circumstances which might affect the result of the case
if not properly considered (<u>People vs. Realon</u>, 99 SCRA 422 [1980]; <u>People
vs. Laganzon</u>, 129 SCRA 333 [1984]; <u>People vs. Pascual</u>, G.R. No.
88282, May 6, 1992; <u>People vs. Simon</u>, G.R. No. 56925, May 21, 1992; <u>People
vs. Blas</u>, G.R. No. 97930, May 27, 1992; <u>People vs. Serdan</u>, G.R. No.
87318, September 2, 1992).  In the case
at bar, We find no justifiable and compelling reason to disturb the findings and
conclusions of the trial court on the credibility of the complaining witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, accused-appellant claims that the trial court erred in
convicting him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of rape, </span>insisting
on his denial of having raped the victim and maintaining that the uncorroborated
testimony of the complaining witness is not sufficient to convict him.  Accused-appellant's posture of innocence is
flimsy and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>jejune.  As in any other rape case, it is most often
that the only witnesses to its commission are the victim and the offender.  Consequently, the only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">testimony </span>available to prove directly
the commission of rape is that of the victim herself.  And as long as such testimony of the offended woman is positive, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">convincing, </span>and credible, We will not
hesitate to render a judgment of conviction.  Furthermore, in weighing contradictory and opposing statements, greater
credence must generally be given to the positive testimony of the prosecution
witnesses than to the denial of the defendant (<u>People vs. Español</u>, [CA],
51 O.G. 2433; <u>People vs. Marilao</u>, 177 SCRA 271 [1989]; <u>People vs.
Adap</u>, 189 SCRA 413 [1990]; <u>People vs. Mariano</u>, 191 SCRA 136 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>the
decision appealed from is hereby affirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>, with costs
against the accused-appellant.</p>
