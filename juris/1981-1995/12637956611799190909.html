<p class="BODY">In a verified complaint dated <st1:date year="1984" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1984</st1:date>, Atty. Arturo A. Romero charged Judge 
Gabriel O. Valle, Jr., of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Regional</st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Trial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype>

<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Branch XII with grave 
misconduct and oppression.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the words of complainant himself, 
the acts complained of consisted in:</p>
<blockquote><i><span>"5. </span>That instead of directing complainant to proceed 
with the marking of exhibits and to continue the direct examination, 
<span>respondent continued to utter <span class="SpellE">embarrasing</span> 
remarks which hurt complainant and, therefore, the latter tried to make 
</span>further </i><i><span>explanations on said 
</span><span>exhi</span></i><i><span>bits and </span><span>to 
</span></i><i><span>defend </span><span>his </span></i><i><span>integrity in 
</span></i><i><span>a </span><span>co</span></i><i><span>ntrolled 
</span></i><i><span>and <span>respectful manner, but his 
</span></span><span>honor, the respondent judge </span></i><i><span>suddenly 
</span><span>banged his gavel producing </span></i><i><span>such a 
</span><span>deafening </span></i><i><span>noise </span><span>that 
several</span></i><i><span> persons from </span><span>the 
</span></i><i><span>adjoining branches of the </span><span>Court came; that 
without declaring a recess, said respondent judge<span>&nbsp; </span>unceremoniously 
REMOVED his coat and told, angrily, herein </span>complainant: ‘You step out and 
we will finish the matter'; immediately thereafter, respondent 
</i><i><span>judge stepped down from the </span>rostrum </i><i><span>and 
left;<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i><span>"6.<span>&nbsp; </span>That, shaken and stunned by such sudden 
aggressive <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of </span>respondent, complainant 
then stood by his seat, and as some people in the Courtroom rushed out of the 
Courtroom, complainant looked around and then saw respondent judge outside the 
courtroom holding a gun with his right hand, in front of him, facing towards 
<span>complainant, in an angry and menacing manner, </span></i><i><span>and 
waited for complainant<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to </span>go outside; confronted by 
such alarming and threatening s</i><i><span>tance of </span><span>respondent, 
complainant could not move </span>for a moment, as complainant was totally 
unarmed, surprised and shocked; and when complainant saw respondent Judge 
briskly walked to and fro, still holding a gun, complainant then asked the Court 
<span>stenographer:<span>&nbsp; </span>‘Please </span>put in the record that the 
Judge </i><i><span>is </span></i><i><span>holding a gun'; </span>that luckily 
thereafter, Atty. </i><i><span>Isidro </span><span class="SpellE">Madamba</span>, 
member the <span class="SpellE">Sangunian</span> </i><span class="SpellE"><i><span>Panlalawigan</span></i></span><i><span>, </span>succeeded 
in pacif</i><i><span>ying </span>respondent judge and </i><i><span>shortly, said 
</span>respondent </i><i><span>returned to the Court; </span>that after 
</i><i><span>some remarks by </span><span>respondent </span>judge, 
</i><i><span>complainant moved </span>that the Honorable</i><i><span> 
</span>respondent voluntarily </i><i><span>inhibit himself from further 
</span>trying </i><i><span>the </span>case in </i><i><span>the light of the 
antecedents, </span>but denied it and ordered </i><i><span>the </span>resetting 
of</i><span>the case;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Required to comment on the complaint, respondent judge denied the 
charges and branded the same as "exaggerated, sensationalized, fabricated and 
inherently improbable and contrary to human experience and one-sided".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Respondent judge likewise explained that 
he has been issued by the provincial commander the necessary permit to carry his 
licensed pistol outside his residence on account of a threat on his life from 
the New People's Army.<span>&nbsp; </span>By way of prayer, he asked that complainant 
be suspended from the practice of law for a certain period of time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="1">January 31,

</span></span>Respondent Judge interrupted </i><i><span>the co</span>mplainant

<span>that there </span>was already <span>an <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span></span></i><i><span> F for</span></i><i><span> 
</span>the plaintiff was confirmed by the manifestation </i><i><span>of

</span>the defendant </i><i><span>after </span>verifying his notes as requested 
</i><i><span>by </span>respondent judge.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the 
complainant in a loud voice insisted that his proposed </i><i><span>marking of 
</span>the </i><i><span>Exhibit </span>is </i><i><span>the correct one a</span>s 
</i><i><span>the Exhibit </span>F referred </i><i><span>to </span>by respondent 
judge and Atty. </i><i><span>Ruiz </span>was not initialed 
</i><i><span>b</span>y </i><i><span>the Clerk </span>of

</span>complainant irritated the respondent judge </i><i><span>who 
</span>retorted </i><i><span>that complainant is not </span>prepared 
f</i><i><span>or </span></i><i><span>tri</span></i><i><span>al and 
</span>admonished </i><i><span>the </span>latter to be prepared with his trial

</span>will </i><i><span>not </span>bangle (sic) the </i><i><span>marking of

continued insisting in a </i><i><span>loud voice that his </span>proposed 
</i><i><span>marking of </span>the inventory </i><i><span>book </span>as 
</i><i><span>Exhibit F </span>is </i><i><span>correct, </span>despite 
</i><i><span>the fact </span>that respondent judge </i><i><span>had admonished 
him [</span>complainant] not </i><i><span>to </span>bring his 
‘</i><i><span>passion’ to the court </span>and if complainant </i><i><span>does 
not </span>respect the Judge, he should <span>respect </span>the court, the 
respondent banged his gavel, left the rostrum and went to his chamber.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>According to the complainant and his witness, [Atty. Andres <span class="SpellE">Tunac</span>, co-counsel of complainant in the case], the 
respondent, before leaving the rostrum made this remark to complainant 'You step 
out.<span>&nbsp; </span>We finish the matter.' Respondent denied having made the 
challenge to complainant and alleged that what he said or declared before 
leaving the rostrum was ‘five minutes <span class="GramE">recess'</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This call for a recess by respondent is confirmed and/or corroborated by 
Atty. Rafael Ruiz, defendant's counsel in the case on trial and respondent's 
witness in this investigation.<span>&nbsp; </span>From his chamber, respondent judge 
went to the stairs passing the corridor holding his coat with his left hand 
while on his right hand he was holding a hand gun [revolver] which was inside 
its holster.<span>&nbsp; </span>As respondent walked on the </i><i><span>corridor 
towards the stairs, he looked at the courtroom where the lawyers were.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Upon reaching the </span>stairs, </i><i><span>respondent was informed 
</span>by his clerk that there are still cases in the calendar ready 
</i><i><span>for trial.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent returned to his chamber and 
placed his </span>gun inside his table.<span>&nbsp; </span>Later,

session.</span></i><span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

stood up and asked the respondent </i><i><span>to inhibit himself from hearing 
the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>The respondent required the complainant to put his 
request in writing and dictated an order </span>resetting the case to another 
date.<span>&nbsp; </span>The case [Civil Case No. </i><i><span>6821], is now 
transferred to another judge who presides over Branch

<p class="BODY">It is evident from the foregoing that complainant and respondent

that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><i>"It is the duty of both counsel and judge to maintain, not to

<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">The relations between counsel and judge 
should be based on mutual respect and on a deep appreciation by one of the 
duties of the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thus, counsel is

properly addressed by one gentleman to another.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Certainly, and most especially in our 
culture, raising one's voice is a sign of disrespect, improper to one whose 
"investiture into the legal profession places upon his shoulders no burden more 
basic, more exacting and more imperative than that of respectful behavior 
towards the courts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Complainant is an active law practitioner in the

complainant should provide an example in proper court decorum to his brothers in 
the profession, and not to foment discord in the courtroom.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Considering complainant's obvious high standing in the legal profession 
and the community, he should have observed humility to accept mistakes 
graciously and to treat the same as the proverbial learning experience.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent judge exhibited shortness of temper 
and impatience, contrary to the duties and restrictions imposed upon him by 
reason of his office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> In <span class="SpellE"><em>Calalang</em></span><em> vs. Fernandez</em>, Adm. Case No.

it merely detracts from the equanimity and judiciousness that should be the 
constant marks of a dispenser of justice.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, 
respondent judge, in losing his temper and engaging complainant in a heated 
discussion, not only failed to observe the proper decorum expected of judicial 
officers, but as a consequence thereof likewise failed to preserve and enforce 
order in his court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Precisely, judicial officers are given 
contempt powers in order that without being arbitrary, unreasonable or unjust, 
they may endeavor to hold counsel to a proper appreciation of their duties to 
the court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge could very well have cited complainant 
in contempt of court instead of indulging in tantrums by banging his gavel in a 
very forceful manner and unceremoniously walking out of the courtroom.</p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent judge appears to have a valid explanation for carrying 
a gun, but such explanation cannot be taken as satisfactory for his having 
chosen to carry the same in plain view of the complainant and other lawyers 
inside the courtroom when he came out of his chambers on his way to the 
stairs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Taken in the light of what had just transpired, the 
actuation of respondent judge was not an innocent gesture, but one calculated to 
instill fear in or intimidate complainant.<span>&nbsp; </span>We cannot let this pass 
unnoticed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge's behavior constitutes grave 
misconduct.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a serious violation of the Canons of Judicial 
Ethics which require that a "judge's official conduct should be free from the 
appearance of impropriety, and his personal behavior, not only upon the bench 
and in the performance of judicial duties, but also in his every day life, 
should be beyond reproach."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Moreover, 
it reveals an attitude diametrically opposed to our pronouncement in <em>De la 
Paz v. Inutan</em>, 64 SCRA 540, that "the judge is the visible representation 
of law, and more importantly, of justice." Certainly, one who lives by the 
uncivilized precept of "might is right", <span>is </span>unworthy of <span>an
