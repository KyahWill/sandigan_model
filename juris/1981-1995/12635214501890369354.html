This is a petition for review by <em>certiorari </em>of the decision of 
the respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which reversed
 the decision of the labor arbiter and ordered the reinstatement of the 
com­plainants with full backwages and no loss of seniority rights and 
other benefits.
<p>
Respondent Enriquez and Capio are budget clerk and accounting clerk 
respectively of the Metal Closure and Lithography Plant under the 
Accounting Department of the petitioner.
</p><p>
The labor arbiter found the following facts as substantially established by the evidences of both parties:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On 11 November 1977, Messrs. Enriquez and Capio were each sent a 
letter by the Assistant Vice-President &amp; Plant Manager F. Andres in 
this wise: </p>
  <p> "Dear Mr. Enriquez: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "After investigation, the Management of San Miguel Corporation 
has found out that you have on various occasions received from the 
Acting Plant Cashier, Mr. Federico Esguerra and/or his back-up man Mr. 
Antonio Fontanilla, as well as the representative of the Storeroom 
Department Mr. Romualdo Abad, the total amount of P278,805.43 
representing cash remittances for sale of finished products as well as 
storeroom materials from the period covering February, 1976 to July, 
1977 for you to remit to the Cash Department, Makati Head Office which 
you failed to do. </p>
    <p> "Demand is, therefore, made on you to pay and restitute to the 
Company the said amount of P278,805.43 within five (5) days from your 
receipt hereof.  Should you fail to do so, much to our regret, we will 
be constrained to institute the appropriate criminal action against 
you.' </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "Dear Mr. Capio: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "After investigation, the Management of San Miguel Corporation 
has found out that you have received from Acting Plant Cashier, Mr. 
Federico Esguerra, and Mr. Romualdo Abad of the Storeroom Department, 
the total sum of P28,498.10 sometime last July, 1976 for your remittance
 to the Cash Department, Makati Head Office and which amount you failed 
to remit to said Cash Depart­ment to the prejudice of the company. </p>
    <p> "Demand is made upon you to pay and restitute to the Company the
 said amount of P28,498.10 within five (5) days from your receipt of 
this letter.  Should you fail to do so, much to our regret, we will be 
constrained to institute the appropriate criminal action against you.' </p>
    <p> "Clearances to terminate the services of Enriquez and Capio for 
alleged misappropriation of company funds were filed by SMC.  Pending 
approval of the clearance applications, complainants were placed under 
preventive suspension. </p>
    <p> "On 18 November 1978, complainants filed a complaint for illegal
 dismissal against SMC which is, in effect, an opposition to the 
clearance applications.  Hence, the instant case. </p>
    <p> "The incident that precipitated the present con­troversy started
 on 20 July 1977 when Romeo Valderama, Plant Accountant of the Metal 
Closure and Lithography Plant of SMC, acting upon a report of the 
Billing and Recording Department verified a complaint of a customer who 
was allegedly called upon by SMC's Collectors in spite of the fact that 
it has already paid its account.  Upon examination of the Cash Receipt 
Summary, he discovered that some official receipts issued by the Plant 
Cashier and Assistant Plant Cashier were not reflected in the Cash 
Receipts Summary.  Otherwise stated, the cash amount covered by said 
official receipts were not delivered to and received by the Cash 
Department of SMC.  He also discovered that amounts realized from sales 
of scrap metal were not remitted to the Cash Department of SMC because 
no official receipts were issued by said department.  On the whole, a 
total of P307,303.53 were allegedly received and transmitted to the Cash
 Department of SMC but did not reach their supposed destination.  The 
matter was then referred to the Legal Department of SMC and all the 
personnel of the Accounting Department were inves­tigated.  The result 
of the investigation shows that the persons allegedly responsible for 
the misappropriation were Manuel Enriquez and Fernando Capio. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>                xxx                   <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx
  </p>
  <p> "The evidence on record shows that Manuel Enriquez was charged 
with the task of personally delivering funds received or collected by 
the Metal Closure and Lithography Plant in Paco, Manila, to the Cash 
Department in Makati.  His position description clearly indicates that 
he goes to the Head Office in Makati for cash deposits.  This fact is 
further confirmed by witnesses for SMC.  Hence, Manuel Enriquez' 
possession and control of company property is sufficiently clear. </p>
  <p> "Witnesses for SMC also attest to the fact that whenever Enriquez 
is absent, complainant Capio, the mail carrier, takes charge of 
depositing cash remittances to Makati.  Witness Romualdo Abad attests to
 the fact that on 7 July 1976 he turned over to Complainant Capio the 
amount of P28,498.10 for remittance and delivery to the Cash Department 
of SMC but records subsequently showed that the aforementioned amount of
 P28,498.10 never reached the Cash Department in Makati. </p>
  <p> "The sizeable amount of money totalling P307,303.05 was actually 
lost is undenied by complainants.  They merely asserted that somebody 
else was responsible.  At any rate, witnesses Valderama, Abad, 
Fontanilla and Esguerra positively stated that various amounts were 
entrusted to the complainants.  On the other hand, witnesses Vengco and 
Richard of the Cash Department denied having received the amounts in 
question and they are concurred in by the Cash Receipts Summary of the 
Billing and Recording Department.  Official receipts issued by the Plant
 Cashier and/or his assistant were not validated by the Cash Department.
  No official receipts were also issued by the Cash Department for sales
 of scrap metal. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx </p>
  <p> "x x x The records show that complainants have to have either the 
logbooks or the transmittal slip signed by either Richard or Vengco of 
the Cash Department to show that the amounts entrusted to them for 
delivery were duly received.  It appears that when investigations 
started the logbook in the possession of complainant Enriquez 
mysteriously disappeared.  They therefore resorted to the use of the 
transmittal slips.  SMA sub­mitted four (4) samples of transmittal slips
 which were apparently received by R. Vengco of the Cash Department.  
However, Vengco repudiated the signatures, explaining that they were 
obvious forgeries.  At first glance, the spurious signatures appear 
genuine but a comparison with the real signature of R. Vengco reveals 
that the head of the capital 'R' is more closed, the tail of the letter 
'g' is also closed and is connected with the letter 'C'. </p>
  <p> "A transmittal slip dated 8 July 1977 was also submitted by SMC 
whereby complainant Enriquez acknowledged receipt of the amount of 
P2,340.96 (Annex 'B' -Res.).  However, Vengco denied having received 
such amount. </p>
  <p> "It is worthy to note that the general tenor of complainants' 
evidence is mere and outright denial of the charges imputed against 
them.  This, however, failed to overcame the positive assertions of 
SMC's witnesses which, when taken together with SMC's documentary 
evidence, results in a clear preponderance in favor of SMC's stand that 
complainants were respon­sible for the amounts lost. </p>
  <p> "Verily then, all the essential elements to justify loss of 
confidence or breach of trust are present in the instant case.  Thus, 
individual complainant duties involve in a positive way the pos­session 
or control of company property; the actual loss of such property and; 
their conduct tending to prove a well-founded suspicion, including 
negligence or carelessness."

</blockquote>
<p>
The complainants, private respondents herein, appealed on grounds of 
abuse of discretion and serious errors in the findings of fact.  The 
respondent NLRC adopted basically the same facts as found by the Labor 
Arbiter but came out with a different conclusion:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We will readily concede one thing, which is that it was guite 
logical, and certainly very con­venient, for the respondent to point the
 finger of suspicion at the complainants, for they admittedly handled 
money belonging to the respondent for trans­mittal from its Metal 
Closure and Lithography Plant to its Cash Department.  But the suspicion
 could also be directed at its other functionaries, such as, for 
instance, those who received and handled the money first, who could have
 failed to deliver to the complainants the amounts supposedly lost for 
the purpose of having them transmitted to the Cash Department.  In other
 words, it is entirely possible that the complainants never received the
 said amounts, in which case the latter could not have been responsible 
for their loss. </p>
  <p> "There is no evidence, in fact, other than the unconfirmed 
statements of same of the respon­dent's witnesses, who, as stated above,
 are themselves not above suspicion, that the complainants received the 
amounts for the loss of which they are being made responsible. </p>
  <p> "In his recommendatory memorandum in the case of the criminal 
complaint filed by the respondent company against complainant Manuel 
Enriquez, dated 11 April 1978, Manila Assistant Fiscal Felizardo M. Lota
 observed, among others, that the said company 'has not come up with 
records to pinpoint, much less impute liability' to complainant 
Enriquez.  On this basis, he found that the Company was not able 'to 
establish a prima facie case to warrant the filing of the corresponding 
information' against Enriquez, and accordingly recommended the dismissal
 of the case against him.  The record shows that this recommendation was
 approved by Fiscal Lota's superiors, and, to all appearances, no 
criminal information was ever filed against Enriquez in the proper 
court. </p>
  <p> "No similar complaint appears to have been lodged against complainant Capio. </p>
  <p> "Indeed, the record of this case shows the kind of laxity in 
accounting procedure that we have earlier remarked upon.  The 
complainants, contrary to all standards of care, were not re­quired to 
acknowledge the receipt of the money they were made to carry to the Cash
 Department.  The result is that it could not be determined with any 
degree of certainty who was responsible for any loss that occurred 
between the time the money was received from the customers to the time 
it was supposed to be deposited in the Cash Department. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx </p>
  <p> "On the basis of the foregoing, we do not agree with the Labor 
Arbiter below that there exists in this case 'a well-founded suspicion' 
of wrongdoing upon which to base a judgment to terminate the 
complainants' services.  To repeat what we have earlier said, the 
complainants herein appear to us to be the victims and not the culprits 
of the supposed mis­deeds that led to this case."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A divided First Division of the NLRC rendered the above decision by a vote of two to one.
</p><p>
Petitioners raise the following assignments of errors:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    A) RESPONDENT COMMISSION GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION WHEN REVERSED
 THE DECISION OF THE LABOR ARBITER THAT WAS FULLY SUBSTANTIATED BY 
EVIDENCE AND, IN LIEU THEREOF, RENDERED A DECISION NOT SUPPORTED BY 
EVIDENCE ON RECORD.
  </p>
  <p>
    B) FURTHERMORE, RESPONDENT COMMISSION GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION 
IN FAILING TO APPLY ITS PREVIOUS RULINGS ON SIMILAR CASES AND IN FAILING
 TO APPLY SIMILAR DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE TRIBUNAL.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We find no compelling reasons to disturb the arbiter's findings of facts
 and his conclusions.  The conclusions of the respondent NLRC based on 
practically the same facts established in the hearings before the 
arbiter impress us to be speculative and conjectural.
</p><p>
The doctrine that the findings of facts of the NLRC are binding on this 
Court if supported by substantial evidence is well established.  
(Antipolo Highway Lines, Inc. v. Inciong, 64 SCRA 441; Philippine Labor 
Alliance Council (PLAC) v. Bureau of Labor Relations, 75 SCRA 162; 
Genconsu Free Workers Union v. Inciong, 91 SCRA 311; Pan-Philippine Life
 Insurance Corp. v. NLRC, 114 SCRA 866; Pepsi-Cola Labor 
Union-BFLU-TUPAS Local Chapter No. 896 v. National Labor Relations, 114 
SCRA 930; Int'l. Hardwood and Veneer Co. of the Phil. v. Leogardo, 117 
SCRA 967 and Mamerto v. Inciong, 118 SCRA 265).  However, in the same 
way that the findings of facts unsupported by substantial and credible 
evidence do not bind this Court (Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. 
Employees Association-NATU v. Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd., 76 SCRA 
50), neither will we uphold erroneous conclusions of the NLRC when we 
find that the latter committed grave abuse of discretion in reversing 
the decision of the labor arbiter (See Visperas v. Inciong, 119 SCRA 
477; Kapisanan ng Manggagawa sa Camara Shoes v. Camara Shoes, 111 SCRA 
477).
</p><p>
The central issue in this case is focused on the right of an employer to
 terminate the employment of an employee on the ground of loss of 
confidence or breach of trust.  The labor arbiter found sufficient 
evidence to uphold the right of the employer.  As a rule this Court 
leans over backwards to help workers and employees continue in their 
employment.  We have mitigated penalties imposed by management on erring
 employees and ordered employers to reinstate workers who have been 
punished enough through suspension.  However, breach of trust and 
confidence and acts of dishonesty and infidelity in the handling of 
funds and properties are an entirely different matter.
</p><p>
In <em>Lepanto Consolidated Mining Co. v. Court of Appeals</em> (1 SCRA 
1251) we held that where an employee occupies position of trust and 
confidence, as where he is entrusted with confidential or delicate 
matters, or with the custody, handling, or care and protection of the 
employer's property, acts tending to show untrustworthiness may 
constitute a just cause for dismissal, or of loss of employer's 
confidence.
</p><p>
Similarly, we stated in <em>Nevans v. Court of Industrial Relations</em> (23 SCRA 1321):
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "loss of confidence is a valid ground for dismissing an employee, 
and proof beyond reasonable doubt of the employee's misconduct - 
apparently demanded by the Minister of Labor - is not required to 
dismiss him on this charge.  (See National Organization of Laborers and 
Employees v. Roldan, 95 Phil. 727; Phil. Refining Co. v. Garcia, 18 SCRA
 107; Gatmaitan v. MRR, 21 SCRA 191).  It is sufficient if there is 
'some basis' for such loss of confidence; (Galsim v. PNB, 29 SCRA 293) 
or if the employer has reasonable grounds to believe, if not to 
entertain the moral conviction that the employee concerned is 
responsible for the misconduct and that the nature of his participation 
therein ren­dered him absolutely unworthy of the trust and confidence 
demanded by his position." (See Reyes v. Zamora, 90 SCRA 92; San Miguel 
Corp. v. the Deputy Minister of Labor and Employment, G.R. Nos. 
61232-33, December 29, 1983). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
By and large, this Court has continually recognized the right of the 
employer to dismiss an employee on the ground of loss of confidence or 
breach of trust.  In <em>Galsim v. Philippine National Bank</em> (29 
SCRA 293) we upheld the dismissal of a bank teller found to have given 
money to a co-employee in violation of bank rules.  Said act which 
caused prejudice to the bank was a justifiable basis for the bank to 
lose its confidence in the employee.  Likewise, we upheld the dismissal 
of an employee on the grounds of use of company property for personal 
use and gain without authority, dishonesty, serious misconduct, fraud, 
and wilfull breach of trust in <em>Int'l. Hardwood and Veneer Co. of the Phil. v. Leogardo</em> (<em>supra</em>).
</p><p>
We have, of course stressed that the right of the employer must not be 
exercised arbitrarily and without just cause; otherwise, the 
constitutional guarantee of security of tenure of the workers would be 
rendered nugatory.  While it is true that to dismiss or lay off an 
employee is a management's prerogative, it must never­theless be done 
without abuse of discretion, for what is at stake is not only the 
worker's position but also his means of livelihood (Kapisanan ng 
Manggagawa sa Camara Shoes v. Camara Shoes, <em>supra</em>).
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    This, we emphasized as follows:
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx </p>
  <p> "xxx Such a vague, all-encompassing pretext as loss of confidence,
 if given the seal of approval by this Court, could easily be utilized 
to reduce to a barren form of words the constitutional guarantee of 
security of tenure.  Precisely, the employee is afforded that protection
 so that his means of livelihood is not placed at the mercy of 
management.  He is just as much a participant in the industrial process.
  He is entitled to be considered as such.  Constitutional provisions 
protecting labor are in line with the predominant thinking all over the 
world safeguarding human dignity.  It would then be to ignore not only a
 mandate of the fundamental law but also a counsel of wisdom and fair 
play to impart to the concept of loss of confidence such a 
latitudinarian scope.  What matters the investigation undergone by 
private respondent resulting in the affirmation of his innocence, if 
thereafter management would just rely on an alleged loss of confidence? 
 x x x" Central Textile Mills, Inc. v. NLRC, 90 SCRA 9; see also Acda v.
 Minister of Labor, 119 SCRA 306). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In disposing of this case, we have fully taken into account the above 
considerations.  We note the undisputed fact that after the discovery of
 the failure to remit pay­ments made by the petitioner's customers to 
the Cash Department, the petitioner through its legal department 
conducted a thorough and intensive investigation.  It was not only the 
respondents Enriquez and Capio who were under suspicion for the loss of 
the P307,303.53 but also all the other employees of the petitioner who 
could have had ac­cess to the funds prior to their remittance to the 
Cash Department.  They were all equally investigated.
</p><p>
The respondent NLRC remarked that there was laxity in the accounting 
procedures of the petitioner.  That is a matter addressed to the 
petitioner but it does not excuse dishonesty of employees and should not
 in any case hamper the right of the employer to terminate the 
employment of employees on the ground of loss of confidence or breach of
 trust.  Precisely, the accounting procedure which called for 
improvements was based primarily on trust and confi­dence.
</p><p>
The two members of the respondent NLRC who voted for the reinstatement 
of the private respondents capitalized on what they considered 
insufficiency of the testimonial evidence.  It should be noted however, 
that the logbook in the possession of respondent Enriquez had 
mysteriously disappeared and the petitioner had to rely on transmittal 
slips to bolster its evidence.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    In <em>Phil. Education Co. v. Union of Phil. Education Employees and CIR</em> (107 Phil. 1003) we held that -
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx </p>
  <p> "The relation of employer and employee, specially where the 
employee has access to the employer's property in the form of articles 
and merchandise for sale, necessarily involves trust and confidence.  If
 said merchandise are lost and said loss is reasonably attributed to 
said employee, and he is charged with theft, even if he is acquitted of 
the charge on reasonable doubt, when the employer has lost its 
confidence in him, it would be highly unfair to require said employer to
 continue employing him or to reinstate him, for in that case, the 
former might find it necessary for its protection to employ another 
person to watch and keep an eye on him.  x x x" (See also Dole 
Philippines, Inc. v. NLRC, 123 SCRA 673). </p>
  </blockquote>
<p> Private respondents rely on the fact that the criminal charges 
brought against them by the petitioner were dis­missed by the Fiscal for
 insufficiency of evidence.  Conviction in a criminal case for the loss 
of the P307,303.53 is not necessary in order that the petitioner may 
terminate the employment of respondents Enriquez and Capio (See Phil. 
Geothermal, Inc. v. NLRC, 117 SCRA 692): </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "x x x Proof beyond reasonable doubt of the employee's misconduct 
is not required, it being sufficient that there is some basis for the 
sane or that the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the 
employee is responsible for the misconduct and his participation therein
 renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded of his 
position.  (Reyes v. Zamora, 90 SCRA 92 [1979]). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As correctly observed by the arbiter, the very wording of the Assistant 
Fiscal's memorandum shows that it was merely recommendatory.  At any 
rate, a failure to pursue a criminal prosecution on grounds of 
insufficient evidence, as in this case where the primary documentary 
evidence was lost, is not determinative of the innocence or culpability 
of the private respondents for purposes of the case before the public 
respondent.  We have held that the acquittal of an employee in the 
criminal charge filed against him by his employer does not guarantee his
 reinstatement if the employer has validly lost confidence in him (Dole 
Philippines, Inc. v. NLRC, <em>supra</em>).  A company has the right to 
dismiss its erring employees if only as a measure of self-protection 
against acts inimical to its interest (Manila Trading &amp; Supply Co. 
v. Zulueta, 69 Phil. 483; Int'l Hardwood and Veneer Co. of the Phil. v. 
Leogardo, <em>supra</em>).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the decision of the respondent National Relations Commission 
is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  The decision of the Labor Arbiter is 
REINSTATED and the clearance to terminate the employment of the private 
res­pondents may issue forthwith.
SO ORDERED.
