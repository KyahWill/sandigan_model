				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Article 1155 of the Civil Code provides that the ''prescription
of actions is interrupted" <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>,
"when there is any written acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor."
This simply means that the period of prescription, when interrupted by such a
written acknowledgment, begins to run anew; and whatever time of limitation
might have already elapsed from the accrual of the cause of action is thereby
negated and rendered inefficacious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>It
does not mean that prescription will not run any more</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this was how the public respondents
construed and applied the cited provision in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They thus incurred in fundamental, grave
error justifying the issuance of the correcting writ of <i>certiorari</i>. </p>

<p class="BODY">More than sixteen (16) years ago, on April 16, 1973 to be
precise, the Court of Industrial Relations promulgated judgment in an unfair
labor practice case instituted by Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span> and
two (2) others against the Philippine National Railways and its Personnel
Manager,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
declaring the respondents guilty as charged and ordering them "to
reinstate the individual complainants to their former work as permanent
employees pursuant to the same Budgets of respondent PNR, with full back wages
from the time of their dismissal until actual reinstatement is effected, without
loss of seniority and other benefits appertaining thereto."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment became final and was ordered executed by Order dated
<st1:date year="1974" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1974</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
Pursuant to a Memorandum issued by the <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> Board of
directors dated December 26, 1974<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> -- approving the reinstatement of
the complainants and payment to them of back wages in accordance with the CIR
decision -- <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span> and the two (2) other complainants
were paid their back salaries in full, i.e., up to April 30, 1974.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
However, only <span class="SpellE">Caldo's</span> co-complainants were
reinstated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caldo</span>
was not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, over the next
twelve (12) years, he repeatedly demanded that he be re-employed, to no avail.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1986</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Caldo</span> filed with the Labor Arbiters' Office (National
Capital Region) a motion for reconstitution and for an alias writ of execution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a>
The motion averred, in substance, (1) that the records of his case were among
those destroyed during "the fire that razed the office of the National
Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) including its Records Office," (2) that
he (<span class="SpellE">Caldo</span>) was entitled to additional back wages from
May 1, 1974 up to March 13, 1986 on which latter date he had allegedly made
known his "non-interest to be reinstated;" and (3) since in the
premises his reinstatement seemed impossible, he should be granted
"separation pay for one (1) month for every year of service from March 16,
1960 up to April 30,1974."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a> The motion was granted and, on the
basis of computations made by an NLRC analyst, a writ of execution issued on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, various technical issues, as the NLRC was to
eventually point out in its Resolution of <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1987</st1:date><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">7</span></span></a> --</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" *</span>* were
raised by appellants which resulted in the referral of this case to the
NLRC-NCR for further deliberation and/or hearings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While this case was pending thereat, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed a Motion for an Alias Writ of Execution on <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Motion was granted by Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Diosana</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
and the corresponding alias Writ of Execution was issued on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1987</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On January 27, 1987, appellant PNR filed an Urgent Motion to Quash
the alias Writ of Execution on the ground that the decision in this case is
more than ten (10) years old and therefore, could not and should not be
enforced by a simple motion, and that the Writ of Execution ordering payment of
P74<span class="GramE">,826,00</span> representing back wages from ten (10) years
ago up to the present is against the decision of the Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> filed an
Opposition thereto arguing inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, that if there
was delay in the execution of judgment, it was because in December 1983, the
records of this case were among those burned in the fire that razed the NLRC
Offices.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PNR filed a Reply to this
Opposition."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a Decision rendered on <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="5">May
 20, 1987</st1:date>, the Labor Arbiter overruled <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span>
motion to quash and ordered payment of back wages to <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span>,
but "limited to three (3) years without qualification or deductions and
without reinstatement."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> She justified her rejection of <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> theory that <span class="SpellE">Caldo's</span> motion
for execution was time-barred in the following manner:<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Rule 39, Section 6 relied upon by respondent PNR in its
motion to quash writ of execution states that judgment may be executed on
motion within five (5) years from the date of entry or from the date it becomes
final (and) <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the lapse of such time and before it is
barred by the statute of limitations, * * a judgment may be enforced by action.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">The statute of limitations, Art.</span> 1155 of
Civil Code, in the matter of prescription of action provides that the
prescription of actions is interrupted when they are filed before the Court,
when there is a written extra-judicial demand and when there is a written
acknowledgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statute of
limitations which, according to Section 6, Rule 39, is said to bar the filing
of actions refers to Art. 1155 jut cited. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>For while under Art. 1144 of the Civil Code,
the right of complainant <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span> to commence action to
enforce the decision of 1973 commenced five (5) years thereafter, that is on or
about April 16, 1978 <i>prescription of the right of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span> to enforce the decision by mere motion did not start
to run because of the written acknowledgment by PNR.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">â€œ *</span> * * * Thus, following Art. 1155 of the
Civil Code, <i>when respondent PNR and the board of directors of PNR
acknowledged through the resolution of its debt and obligation to complainant <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span>, the prescription of the right of complainant <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span> to seek the execution of the April 16, 1973 decision
was stopped.</i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the position of
respondent PNR is not well taken."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Arbiter's decision was affirmed by the NLRC in its own
Resolution promulgated on <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="10">October 27<span class="GramE">,1989</span></st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> It declared, citing "a
well-known and respected commentator," that "acknowledgment of a debt
that suspends the prescriptive period need not be express so long as it is in
writing," and <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> failure "to seasonably
invoke the issue of prescription, although it had sufficient opportunity to do
so, constitutes a waiver of the same." The Commission subsequently denied <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1144 of the Civil Code provides that an action "upon
a judgment," i.e., to execute a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
judgment, "must be brought within ten years from the time the right of
action accrues." However, by virtue of the Rules of Court, the enforcement
of a judgment does not entail an action, in the sense of an ordinary suit in a
court of justice (Sec. 1, Rule 2), a motion being sufficient if execution is
sought within the first five years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is made clear by Section 6, Rule 39:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 6.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><i>Execution by motion or
by independent action.</i></span> -- A judgment may be executed on motion
within five (5) years from the date of its entry or from the date it becomes
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by the statute of
limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In this case, it is clear
that the judgment of the Court of Industrial Relations had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> at least as of <st1:date year="1974" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1974</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> It could have been executed by
motion within five (5) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It could have been enforced by an
independent action within the next five (5) years (or within ten (10) years
from the time it became final).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the right of action to
enforce the judgment had prescribed by the time that <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span>
filed his "Motion for Reconstitution of the Record of the Case and
Issuance of Alias Writ of Execution" on <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1986</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> Indeed, even if the motion had been
filed within the second five-year period, it would still have been
inefficacious since execution by motion was no longer possible then, an
independent action being needful for the purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even if the ten-year period of limitation
were to be reckoned from December 26, 1974, the day when the PNR Board of
Directors, acknowledging the company's obligation under the CIR judgment,
ordered reinstatement and payment of back salaries to <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span>
and his two (2) co-complainants, the prescriptive period would still have to be
regarded as expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory advocated by the respondents, that the resolution of
the PNR Board of Directors of December 26, 1974, considered as a "written
acknowledgment of the debt by the debtor" within the meaning of Article
1155 of the Civil Code, did not merely interrupt and renew the prescription of
the right to execute the judgment but caused it to stop completely, placing it,
as it were, in an indefinite state of suspended animation, is fallacious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The effect of the interruption spoken of in
Article 1155 is to renew the obligation, to make prescription run again from
the date of the interruption and not, to repeat, to cause it to stop running
altogether.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The destruction by fire of the records of CIR Case No. 5414-ULP,
which allegedly occurred in December, 1983, cannot be regarded as having
interrupted said period, for it obviously did not prevent <span class="SpellE">Caldo</span>
from attempting to reconstitute the records and instituting the action before
the expiry of the period of ten years from finality of the judgment rendered
therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Article 1154, declaring
that the "period during which the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> was
prevented by a fortuitous event from enforcing his right is not reckoned
against him," is inapplicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is thus constrained to pronounce Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Caldo's</span> attempt to execute the judgment in CIR Case No.
5414-ULP, by the filing of a motion to this effect (after reconstitution of the
records), to be ineffectual not only because it was time-barred but also
because, even assuming the contrary, execution could not longer be had by
motion but by independent action.</p>
