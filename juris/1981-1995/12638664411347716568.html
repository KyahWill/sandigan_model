our Decision in this same case, promulgated on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="10">26 October 1987</st1:date>, in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"On 20 August 1954, petitioners filed a complaint (docketed as
Civil Case No. 2967) against respondents for the recovery of a twenty hectare
parcel of unregistered agricultural land (Lot 1236, Pls-667) situated in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span>, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Atotes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bindoy</span>, a remote
mountainous region of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was dismissed by the trial
court on <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="1">31 January 1962</st1:date>
due to the failure of counsel for petitioners to appear at the scheduled
hearing of the case:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the dismissal,
however, was ordered without prejudice to the <span class="SpellE">refiling</span>
of the same complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1962" day="20" month="12">20 December 1962</st1:date>,
petitioners <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> their complaint (docketed this
time as Civil Case No. 4100) with the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental (12th Judicial District).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence for the petitioners (plaintiffs below) indicates that
Lot 1236 was one of two pieces of real property originally owned and cultivated
by the late <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>,
a native <span class="SpellE">negrito</span> or <span class="SpellE">Aeta</span> (<u>Ate</u>
in the <span class="SpellE">Ilongo</span> dialect) (Brief for Appellants, p. 2;
and Memorandum, p. 1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon his death
(the date is not specified), Lot 1236 was inherited by:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>, Bohemia <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Belta</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Inojaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, the children of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> with Elena <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>; and (2)
Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, the son of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> with Lucia <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other five-hectare property situated in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span>, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Atotes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bindoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental (Lot 1237, Pls-667), on the other hand, was
inherited solely by Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioners, the grandchildren and descendants of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> out of his union
with Elena <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, contended that <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> began occupying Lot 1236 long before the
advent of World War II and had cultivated the land by planting no less than 300
coconut trees, 19 mango trees, and 33 bamboo groves thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The occupation and possession by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, his children, and
petitioners of Lot 1236 remained undisturbed until sometime in 1953 when
respondent Gregorio Bolo, a common law husband of one of the granddaughters of
Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, caused the survey of Lots 1236 and
1237 in June 1948, and proceeded to occupy Lot 1236 claiming to have purchased
the same on 11 April 1948 from respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners contested the claim of respondent
Bole and asserted that what had been sold to him was only <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1237 (area:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>5 hectares) and that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1236 (area:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>20 hectares) was
surreptitiously declared by respondent Bolo in the aforementioned survey as property
owned exclusively by Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners also contended that respondent
Bolo, in his desire to consolidate possession and ownership of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1236 in his name harassed petitioners by instituting a criminal case for
qualified theft on <st1:date year="1953" day="7" month="10">7 October 1953</st1:date>
against <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>
and petitioner <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>
([T]his criminal case was dismissed by the trial court on <st1:date year="1956" day="21" month="2">21 February 1956</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>
died on <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="9">2 September 1984</st1:date> and
was substituted in this petition by his wife, fourteen children, and two
grandchildren) and by threatening to liquidate the other petitioners if they
persisted in their refusal to abandon the disputed property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For their part, respondents (defendants below), the grandchildren
and surviving heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, contended that
it was not improper for them to sell Lot 1236 to respondent Bolo on the ground
that said property had always been owned exclusively by Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, contrary to the claim by petitioners that Lot 1236
was owned in common by the six children of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> by his two wives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents presented Tax Declaration No. 123 issued on <st1:date year="1948" day="7" month="8">7 August 1948</st1:date> in the name ‘<span class="SpellE">Herederos</span> de Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>' in
support of their claim of ownership over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1236, and
in rebuttal of Tax Declaration No. 6051 issued in 1953 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> which was
presented in evidence by petitioners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="9">17 September 1984</st1:date>,

portion of which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'WHEREFORE, premises considered, plaintiffs’ complaint is hereby

the ages of the three hundred (300) coconut trees and the circumference of the
nineteen (19) mango trees planted inside said Lot No. 1236 (TSN, April 3,
1974).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That petitioner <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>, together with his
aunts and their children who are the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> with Elena <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>

</span>The contention of defendants that Tax Dec. No. 6051 was concocted to
facilitate the filing of Civil Case No. 2967 by plaintiffs against herein
defendants is untenable, consider­ing the fact that Tax Dec. No. 6051; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A' was issued on September 12, 1953 while the filing
of the Civil Case No. 2967 took place one year <span class="SpellE">thereafer</span>,

and occupation of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>,
his children and grandchildren, who are the plaintiffs in this case of Lot No.

a common-law husband of one of the granddaughters of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
had Lots Nos. 1236 and 1237 surveyed (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘12')
occupied said lots claiming to have purchased the same from the heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> by virtue of an Absolute Deed of Sale dated <st1:date year="1949" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1949</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

Lot No. 1236, defendant Gregorio Bolo threatened and harassed plaintiffs by
filing Criminal Case No. 257 before the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bindoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental for the
crime of "Qualified Theft" against <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amarante</span> and <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>, who are among the plaintiffs in this case (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'C') which was dismissed on the ground that question
of ownership was involved (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'C-1')
and Criminal Case No. 336 before the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Payabon</span> (now <span class="SpellE">Bindoy</span>), <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental for the crime of "Light Threats"
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">'D') which case was
likewise dismissed on the ground that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt
of accused beyond reasonable doubt (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">'D-1').</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That unable
to eject plaintiffs from the land in question with the filing of the
aforementioned cases, defendant­ Gregorio Bolo threatened to kill plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span> and by virtue of
said threat, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante's</span>
aunts and cousins vacated and left the land in question with <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span> the last to vacate

children and wife for he (<span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>)

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first issue we need
to consider is a preliminary one, relating to the nature of the underlying
action in the Petition at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> by the petitioners with the then
Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, was
captioned “Civil Case No. 4100:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
Recovery of Real Property".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
designation given by petitioners to their own pleadings does not, however,
obligate us to treat it as no more than an action for recovery of possession of
real property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a principle
consistently adhered to in this jurisdiction that is not the caption but the
facts alleged in the complaint or other pleading which give meaning to the
pleading and on the basis of which such pleading may be legally characterized.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the law on pleadings, courts are frequently called upon to pierce veiling
forms and to go direct to the substance of things.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Courts are not, therefore to be bound by <span class="SpellE"><u>falsa</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>descriptio</u></span> or
defective caption given to a pleading for such is not controlling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Courts are rather to be guided by the
substantive averments of the pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On this basis, we believe and so hold that the action filed by the
petitioners was one not merely for recovery of possession of real property but
rather one also for quieting of title.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">8</span></span></a> It will be seen that Article 476 of
the Civil Code which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 476.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whenever
there is a cloud on <u>title to</u> real property <u>or any interest therein</u>,
<u>by reason of any instrument</u>, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding
which is <u>apparently valid or effective but is in truth and in fact invalid,
ineffective, <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>, or unenforceable, and may be
prejudicial to said title</u>, an action may be brought to remove such cloud or
to quiet the title.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An action may also be brought to prevent a cloud from being cast
upon title to real property or any interest therein." (Underscoring

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">is</span> precisely applicable
to the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We should consider next
the character or the rights held by petitioners in respect of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1236.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span> showed that in
1974, the coconut trees planted by petitioners and their predecessors-in-interest
were already approximately seventy (70) years of age.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mango trees had trunks with
circumferences of about three (3) arm lengths; indicating once more that those
trees <span class="GramE">were</span> very old.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">9</span></span></a> Thus, it was clearly shown that <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> had begun occupying
Lot No. 1236 a very long time ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">When the possession of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> of the land is tacked on to that of petitioners,
there is no question that possession exceeded thirty (30) years which is the
period for extraordinary prescription provided for in Article 1137 of the Civil
Code.</span></p>

1236 is really the <u>tract of land located in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> which had been occupied and cultivated by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> and his
successors-in-interest, petitioners in the instant case</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This tract of land in <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span>,
approximately twenty (20) hectares in area, is covered by Tax Declaration No.
6051 standing in the name of petitioners, heirs of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, and obtained by them on <st1:date year="1953" day="12" month="9">12 September 1953</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this and in our earlier Decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="10">26 October 1987</st1:date>, we have used the
term "<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 1236" as simply a shorthand way
of referring to the parcel of land in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span>, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Atotes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bindoy</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Negros</span></span>
Oriental.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same way, what we have in this decision and earlier
referred to as Lot No. 1237 is really the parcel of land located in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span>, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Atotes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bindoy</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Negros</span></span> Oriental, which had also
been occupied and cultivated by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must then note that Lot No. 1236 in Gregorio Bolo's Survey
Plan purports to be much larger than the 20-hectare <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span>
parcel of land occupied and cultivated by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
had been overlain and absorbed by Lot No. 1236 of Gregorio Bolo's Survey
Plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the tract of land in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span> occupied and
cultivated by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>
was overlain and absorbed by Lot No. 1237 of Gregorio Bolo's Survey Plan, which
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1237 was much larger than the 5-hectare tract of
land <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> had
occupied and cultivated in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the land covered by Gregorio Bolo's
Survey Plan presumably resting upon the Absolute Deed of Sale of 6 April 1949
purported to be more than twice the combined area of the original <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Awang</span> tracts of land
occupied and cultivated by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> and his successors-in-interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">As discussed earlier, the heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
had no rights at all in respect of the <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span>
parcel of <st1:place><st1:placetype>land</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No credible explanation was offered as to why
they had declared under their own name in Tax Declaration No. 123 not only the
original <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span> tract
of land of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>
(concededly inherited by Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> from <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>) but also the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> parcel of land of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">lnfiel</span>, as well as the
surrounding lands obviously owned or claimed by other persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, Tax Declaration No. 123 and
Gregorio Bolo's Survey Plan showed that in some unknown and unexplained way,
Gregorio Bolo's claims had expanded more than ten-fold from the original
5-hectare <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span>
parcel of land allocated to Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> to a grand
total of 53.19 hectares (under the Absolute Deed of Sale) or 52.5367 hectares
(under Gregorio Bolo's Survey Plan).</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stressed that because, as already pointed out
petitioners had become owners of the <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract
of land originally occupied and cultivated by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, through long continued, exclusive, open and
notorious possession of said tract of land, the supposed vendors under the
Absolute Deed of Sale, the respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>,
had no rights at all in respect of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land which they could have conveyed to
respondent Gregorio Bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> have pretended that their
predecessor-in-interest Felix <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Malonis</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> was also owner of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This pretense is bereft of support in the evidence of record.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must then go back to the basic point made in our earlier
Decision in this case on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="10">26 October
 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There we pointed to
the provisions of Section 120 of the Public Land Act, Commonwealth Act. No. 141
as amended by Republic Act No. 3872:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 120.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conveyance and encumbrance made by persons
belonging to the so-called "non-<span class="SpellE">christian</span>
Filipinos" or national cultural minorities, when proper, shall be valid if
the person making the conveyance or encumbrance is able to read and can
understand the language in which the instrument or conveyance or encumbrances
is written.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Conveyances</u> or
encumbrances <u>made by illiterate non-Christians</u> or literate
non-Christians where the instrument of conveyance of encumbrance is in a
language not understood by the said literate non-Christians <u>shall not be

Integration</u> [now, the Presidential Assistant for Cultural
Minorities)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">15</span></span></a> (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">There is nothing in the record to show <span class="GramE">that respondent heirs</span> of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
who are, like Felix himself and his father <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, native "non-Christian" <span class="SpellE">Aetas</span> and who appear to have executed the Deed of Sale were
literate or schooled individuals able to read and understand the English
language in which the Absolute Deed of Sale was written.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Absolute Deed of Sale itself
stated that the respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> did
<u>not</u> know how to read and write:</p>

<blockquote>"IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we have hereunto caused to affix our
right thumb-marks <u>for not knowing how to read and write</u>, after the (sic)
this instrument was read and translated to us in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
dialect known to us this 6th day of April 1949 in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Manjuyod</span>, Neg. Or., Philippines." (Underscoring
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Accordingly, the respondent heirs,
instead of signing the Absolute Deed of Sale to show their <span class="SpellE">confirmity</span>
thereto, had merely affixed their <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Deed is in fact note­worthy in that not a
single signature by any of the sixteen (16) supposed vendors appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not pretended that Deed was approved by
competent authority under Section 120 of the Public Land Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is the legal consequence of failure to obtain the approval
of the then Commissioner of Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> for the
Absolute Deed of Sale here involved?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
believe and so hold that the failure to obtain that approval had the effect of
rendering the Absolute Deed of Sale here involved as null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <u>initio</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">16</span></span></a> We believe that this conclusion is
compelled not only by the express words of Section 120 of the Public Land Act
as amended but also by a consideration of the fundamental public policy which
Section 120 seeks to realize:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and that
is, the protection of members of the "non-Christian" cultural
minorities in our country such as the respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> and the petitioners, heirs of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, themselves from their own illiteracy or lack
of schooling and from those who would manipulate and exploit them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Absolute Deed of Sale under cover
of which respondent Gregorio Bolo wound up in possession of all the land
originally occupied and cultivated by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> in <span class="SpellE">Sitios</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Awang</span>, as well as a
great deal of other land in the vicinity thereof, was not merely a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> contract; it was, rather, an <u>absolutely void or
legally inexistent instrument</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
conferred no rights whatsoever upon respondent' Gregorio Bolo who, it might be
noted, was careful not to sign that Deed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It certainly was ineffective to affect in anyway or transmit the rights
of petitioners to the <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land
originally possessed and occupied by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Turning to the
conflicting tax declarations of petitioners and private respondent heirs of
Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, it was earlier noted that both the
court of origin and the respondent appellate court concluded that the
petitioners' tax declaration was a mere "concoction" devised only
"to offset the effects of respondents' tax declaration".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Tax Declaration No. 123 in
the name of “<span class="SpellE">Herederos</span> de Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>"
was obtained by private respondents on </span><st1:date year="1948" day="7" month="8"><span class="GramE">7 August 1948</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, Tax Declaration No. 6051
in the name of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Infiel</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
was obtained by petitioners on <st1:date year="1953" day="12" month="9">12
 September 1953</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While Tax
Declaration No. 6051 was obviously later in point of time than Tax Declaration
No. 123, this circumstance alone does not support the conclusion reached by the
two (2) courts below.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No.
2967 was commenced on <st1:date year="1954" day="20" month="8">20 August 1954</st1:date>
almost a year after issuance of Tax Declaration No. 6051.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we cannot simply assume, as apparently
the two (2) courts below did, that Tax Declaration No. 6051 was secured solely
for the purpose of filing Civil Case No. 2967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We agree with the conclusion of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tabilon</span>
on this point.</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems useful to stress that being in actual and long continued
possession of the parcel of land in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Campulay</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
petitioners were fully entitled to declare such parcel of land in their own
name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This right was not any way
restricted, and much less was it foreclosed, by the earlier tax declaration
obtained by private respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>,
doubtless with the assistance and probably the urging of Gregorio Bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At most, Tax Declaration No. 123 indicated
that the respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> were
claiming title to or rights in the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land originally possessed and cultivated
by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> Infiel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">17</span></span></a> Such a claim, however, was not
supported nor accompanied by possession of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> parcel of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As is well-known, it is only where payment of taxes is accompanied by
actual possession of the land covered by the tax declaration, that such
circumstance may be material in supporting a claim of ownership.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">18</span></span></a>
In the case at bar, as more than once pointed out, private respondents were
never in possession of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span>
parcel until private respondent Gregorio Bolo, acting pursuant to a void and
legally inexistent Absolute Deed of Sale and by threats and intimidation, drove
petitioners out of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span>
tract of land and took physical possession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We turn to the question
of whether or not the respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
are entitled to a one-sixth (1/6) portion of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We earlier noted that petitioners did not
question the right of the respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
to the 5-hectare piece of property situated in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span> which had been inherited solely by Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> from the <span class="GramE">parties</span> common
ancestor -- <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, upon the other hand, did not claim one-sixth (<u>1/6</u>)
portion of the <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What they claimed was <u>the whole of the <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land</u> and a great deal of surrounding
land as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was thus incumbent upon
the respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> to show a
lawful basis for Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> or his heirs to
participate in the ownership of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It will be recalled that the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> parcel of land had <span class="GramE">a</span> area
of 20 hectares such that the five (5) children of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> with Elena <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>
were entitled to a <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span> share
of four (4) hectares each.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, upon the other hand, was assigned a 5-hectare
piece of land in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing whether <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
or otherwise why Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> or his heirs should
have any claim to participate as well in the ownership of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> parcel of
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the trial court in its
findings of fact transmitted to this Court in the Report dated <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="4">7 April 1989</st1:date> of Judge <span class="SpellE">Tabilon</span>, found that petitioners alone were entitled to the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> parcel of land
while Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> and his heirs were exclusively
entitled to the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Awang</span>
tract of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We see no reason for
overturning such conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We consider finally the
petitioners’ claim for damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their
amended complaint <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> on 10 December 1962 before
the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental,
petitioners alleged, among other things, that the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> parcel of land yielded a total annual income
stream of P2,800.00:</p>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 300
fruit-bearing coconut trees yield 16,000 nuts a year valued at P800.00; the 19
fruit-bearing mango trees yield 9,500 fruits a year valued at P950.00; the 15
hectare corn land produce 150 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of grains a year
valued at P1<span class="GramE">,050.00</span> for a total annual income of
P2,800.00 which respondent Bolo appropriated to himself to the prejudice of
petitioners."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>, daughter of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>, testified that when they were still
occupying the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span>
tract of land, they used to harvest 16,000 coconuts a year which, computed on
the basis of P0.10 per nut, possibly the value thereof when she testified in
1975, would come up to P1,600.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 19
mango trees were, according to <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>, yielding
annually 3,800 fruits with a total value of P380.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the evidence relating to the damages
actually suffered by petitioners consisting of income from the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> land which
starting from 1954 had been appropriated by respondent Gregorio Bolo to his own
uses, is less than satisfactory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
note, firstly, that the reference is to annual <u>income</u> from the land but
no clarification was made as to whether such figure referred to <u>gross</u>
income or whether it referred to income already net of expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note, secondly, that the record is bare of
testimony relating to the change in value of the produce on the <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> parcel of land from the time the amended complaint
was filed in 1962 and onwards.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
must, however, take judicial notice of the fact that nominal peso value of such
commodities as coconuts, mangoes and cereal grains (rice or corn) have
substantially increased over the last thirty-five (35) years. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Notwithstanding the less than satisfactory
condition of the record insofar as the amount of actual or compensatory damages
is concerned, in order that the Court may write <u>finis</u> to this case which
began thirty-five (35) years ago, the Court in the exercise of its discretion
believes that it would be reasonable to balance out the two (2) above factors
and accordingly to award the amount of damages claimed (P2,800.00 per year)
multiplied by thirty-five (35) years or a total of P98,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court also believes that because private
respondent Gregorio Bolo drove the petitioners by threats and intimidation and
the use of void and inexistent documents from the possession which they and
their forbears had previously enjoyed of the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Campulay</span> tract of land, attorney's fees are properly
assessed from private respondent Gregorio Bolo in the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">19</span></span></a></p>
