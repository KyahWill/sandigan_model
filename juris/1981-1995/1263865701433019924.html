				<H3>EDWINA LEMA BEECH AND LEONARDO MANECLANG, PETITIONERS, VS. HONORABLE JOSE C. DE GUZMAN, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 93 OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, AND LETICIA BADAR, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners are engaged in training local talents for overseas
employment under the name <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Veam</span></span><span style=""> Enterprises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In September 1986, private respondent Leticia <span class="SpellE">Badar</span>
entered into an agreement with petitioner Edwina <span class="SpellE">Lema</span>
Beech as general manager <span style="">and </span>representative
of <span class="SpellE">Veam</span> Enterprises, owned by co-<span style="">petitioner </span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Maneclang</span>, whereby the former dubbed as production manager
of said enterprise shall be given fifty dollars ($50.00) per talent as regular
commission and four hundred pesos (P400.00), as processing fee per talent that
went to the principal of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Badar</span> was able <span style="">to </span>send 79 talents to petitioners who
were confirmed to leave for <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Japan</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, </span>hence,
respondent is entitled to <span style="">a </span>commission of P79<span class="GramE">,000</span>, as regular
commission, and <span style="">P100,000, as processing
fee of </span>the 25 <span style="">talents that went
to respondent's principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
petitioners only </span>paid <span style="">respondent
P20,000.00, as her regular commission and P5,600.00 for the processing of the
25 talents, leaving an unpaid balance of P59,000, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">regular commission and P4,400, as processing fee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent sent a demand
letter (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) to petitioner to make good the
claim but petitioner, despite receipt thereof still failed to pay the </span><span style="">same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereupon, </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="2"><span style="">February 24, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent <span class="SpellE">Badar</span>
filed a complaint for </span><span style="">sum of </span><span style="">money in the
Regional </span><span style="">Trial </span><span style="">Court</span><sup> </sup><span style="">of</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City against petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>On July 24, 1987, finding that respondent had substantiated her
causes of action with clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence, the trial
court rendered judgment in favor of respondent ordering the petitioner:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To</span> pay plaintiff, jointly and severally, the total amount of
P63,400.00, representing the unpaid regular commission <span style="">and processing fee;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"2<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">To</span></span></span>
pay plaintiff, jointly and <span style="">severally,
the amount of P10,000.00, by way of attorney's fees; and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"3<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To</span> pay the costs."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 2, Decision; p. 32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now raise the issue that <span style="">the </span><span style="">trial </span><span style="">court has no jurisdiction over the subject
matter and/or nature of the action or suit since the case is one for money
claims arising from employer-employee </span>relationship and therefore it is
the <span style="">labor arbiters who have the
exclusive and original jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition is totally
unmeritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, private respondent is an independent <span style="">contractor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span class="SpellE">Badar</span> was not a regular salary paid
employee but <span style="">earns on </span>a per
head/talent commission basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She can
work <span style="">as she </span>pleases,
on her own schedule, terms and conditions.</p>

<blockquote>"The principal consideration in determining whether <span style="">a </span>workman is an employee or an
independent contractor is the right to control the manner <span style="">of </span>doing the work, and it is not the
actual exercise of the right by interfering with the work, but the <span style="">right to </span>control, which constitutes
the test." (<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Feati</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place> vs. Bautista, 18 SCRA
1191)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And secondly, petitioners are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from raising the defense of the presence of employer-employee relationship
since petitioners in their Answer to the Complaint of private respondent
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"As stated above, <span style="">plaintiff
</span>(now private respondent) was never an employee of defendant (now
petitioner) being that employee-employer relationship never existed between
defendant and plaintiff and therefore plaintiff could not be the production
manager of defendant's <span class="SpellE"><span style="">veam</span></span><span style=""> enterprises instead Plaintiff is a free
lance talent scout." (p. 26, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court had jurisdiction over the case at bar since the
suit arose from a contract between petitioners and independent contractor <span class="SpellE">Badar</span> and not one under an employer-employee relationship.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">PREMISES CONSIDERED</span></b><span class="GramE"><span style="">,</span></span><span style=""> the petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera, (Chairman),
Padilla, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span>
<span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.</span></span><br>
