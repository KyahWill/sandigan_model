contention of petitioners that in so providing in said orders that its decision

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Indeed, a judgment cannot

SCRA 310).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is elementary that
strangers to a case are not bound by the judgment rendered by the court (Bien
v. Sunga, 117 SCRA 249) and such judgment is not available as an adjudication
either against or in favor of such other person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A decision of a court will not operate to
divest the rights of a person who has not and has never been a party to <span class="GramE">a litigation</span>, either as plaintiff or defendant (Granados v.
Monton, 86 Phil., 42).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Verily, execution
of a judgment can only be issued against one who is a party to the action, and
not against one who, not being a </span>party in the case, has not yet had his
day in court (City of Bacolod, et al., v. Hon. Enriquez, et al., 101 Phil.,
644; Tayson V. Angeles v. Icasiano, et al., 83 Phil., 921; Manza v. Hon.

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Anent the effect of the

of the mortgagor when given as a security for a bank loan, the subsequent declaration
of said title as null and void is not a ground for nullifying the mortgage
rights of the bank which had acted in good faith (Philippine National
Cooperative Bank v. Carandang-Villalon, 139 SCRA 570).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, there are instances when
even a </span>fraudulent and forged document of sale may become the root of a
valid title if the certificate had already <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

investigate the title of the mortgagor appearing on the face of said

the mortgaged property when it was mortgaged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The main purpose of the
Torrens System is to avoid possible conflicts of title real estate, and to
facilitate transactions relative thereto by giving the public the right to rely
upon the face of a Torrens certificate of title and to dispense with the need
of inquiring further, except when the party concerned had actual knowledge of
facts and circumstances that should </span>impel a reasonably cautious man to
make such further inquiry (Pascua v. Capuyoc, 77 SCRA 78).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, where innocent third persons relying on
the correctness of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">certificate of

disregard such rights <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(Director of Land
