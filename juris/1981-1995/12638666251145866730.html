a farmer wending his way home in a <span class="SpellE">bullcart</span> after a
hard day’s work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is standing in
front, guiding the cow pulling the creaking cart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Behind, perched on top of the hay they had
gathered earlier are his son and two grandsons, lazing in the quiet of the
approaching dusk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Everything is serene;
there are probably even songbirds twittering in the trees, to make the idyll

ineffable peace has calmed the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

him in the chest and arms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second,

breast as he toppled heavily to </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span class="SpellE">Manzon</span>, a brother of the victim, who declared that he
was the first to reach Pablo <span class="SpellE">Manzon</span> after the attack

their grandmother to testify falsely because of her hatred for <span class="SpellE">Sisenando's</span> family.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The defense also

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">It
is also </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the contention of the
defense that Larry <span class="SpellE">Tamondong</span> could not have possibly
seen the stabbing if, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he testified, he jumped
off the cart immediately after he saw the shooting of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his
grandfather.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">suspiciously inconsistent on whether the
stabbing preceded or followed the shooting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The defense likewise maintained that if the boys were really not lying,
the bullets would have had an upward trajectory as Pablo <span class="SpellE">Manzon</span>
</span>was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">allegedly shot while
standing on the front part of the cart.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As to this last
contention, it appears from the testimonies of both Dr. Pizarro, a prosecution
witness, and Dr. Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Brion</span>, who was called by the
defense, that no finding had been made regarding the trajectory of the bullets,
which had caused three entry wounds and only one exit wound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">When it comes to
questions of fact and the assessment of the testimonial evidence, we accord
much weight to the findings of the trial judge who tried the case and observed
the demeanor of the witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Absent a
showing that these findings are tainted with arbitrariness, the appellate court
must rely heavily on the determinations of the court </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

that is not enjoyed by the reviewing court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As this Court observed in one case:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The appellate court can go only by the records, without the
opportunity of seeing for itself how the persons testifying react to questions
put to them and noting those little gestures and telltale signs that can limn
the line between fact and fabrication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These are not found in the transcript and so may not be fully
appreciated on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the trial
judge can see all these.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the rule
that his findings on this matter are accorded much <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">respect, if not indeed conclusive effect, save only in those
exceptional instances where they are clearly shown to be arbitrary.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">We
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">do not disbelieve the two young
witnesses because of their minor inconsistencies as the boys were
understandably jolted by the traumatic incident and cannot be expected to
remember every one of its ugly details with perfect accuracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And neither can we believe </span>that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">they were coached into "framing"
the accused because the record shows that they immediately revealed the killers
and identified them to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mandapat</span> when he
questioned them only two hours after the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if it be conceded that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Manzon</span> and </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Posadas</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> were not lying, the two children might have
had their reasons for not telling the truth then, considering that </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accused were also their close relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What matters is that at the proper time and
place, they came out categorically and pointed to <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">are </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

satisfactory explanation for such malevolent attitude.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither she nor the two <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">accused were </span>directly involved in the
land dispute between her husband and his brother <span class="SpellE">Sisenando</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, we do </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">believe that a grandmother would corrupt her
minor <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">grandchildren, for </span></span>the

their own uncles to jail, perhaps for the rest of their <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">As </span>for Pablo's
dying declaration, Dr. Pizarro testified that the wounds, although fatal, did
not cause instantaneous death and prevent the victim from pointing to his
killers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was possible for Pablo to
speak to his wife before he expired although he might have been unwilling or
unable to talk earlier to his brother Francisco, who had arrived before
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not unnatural for a dying man
to save his ebbing strength so he can share the last moments of his life with
his wife.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We
</span>probably no longer have to rule on the question of conspiracy because <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Manzon</span> remains the lone

wounds inflicted by <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> was as fatal as the
gunshot wounds caused by <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span>, thus making both of
them co-principals in the killing of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Manzon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, we find that the conspiracy has
been established, it appearing that the brothers lay in wait for their victim
with the same objective, attacked him almost simultaneously and in concert with
each other, and subsequently fled together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
