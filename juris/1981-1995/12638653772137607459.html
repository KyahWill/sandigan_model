<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution is that on January 15, 1984, at or
about 7:45 p.m., <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Berenguel</span>
was on his way to a store at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bathala</span>, Seminary
Road, in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, whereupon, the two accused
accosted him and asked for money with which to purchase liquor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He allegedly refused, upon which, the former
took turns in inflicting blows on him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, he managed to flee towards the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>;
however, they caught up with him until he fell down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moments later, they dived at him with knives
while he lay sprawled on the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">And as he lay there, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Berenguel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Conrado's</span> cousin,
intervened to pacify the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of
them however grabbed him by the arms and as he stood helpless, the other
repeatedly stabbed him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Berenguels</span> were <span class="SpellE">therafter</span>
rushed to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City
  General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>, who
survived, spent P300.00 for treatment of stab wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>,
however, did not make it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His remains
were later transported to the <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Memorial Homes, and
after his sister, Salvation <span class="SpellE">Berenguel</span>, paid a total
of P5,100.00 for various funeral and burial services, were laid to rest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> died as a consequence of
stab wounds, sustained as follows:</p>

<span class="SpellE">x</span> [t]hat in that diagram sketch, he found three (3)
stab wounds on the abdomen of <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Berenguel</span>, two of which were in front and the other one on
the left side back portion; that he also noted two (2) incise wounds on the
body of the victim, one of them was indicated on the lower portion of the right
side of the chest and the other one on the <span style="">front side of the abdomen; and that the foregoing findings were all
contained in the final autopsy report N-84-148 he made (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.

<p class="BODY">The accused, on the other hand, claim that it was <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> who attacked them with a "shoe knife"
while playing chess in front of the store.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter, who was allegedly drunk, kicked the chess board upon which,
they (the accused) fell down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> supposedly began hitting both of them with his
knife, injuring them, after which they ran toward their house where <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Marcedonia</span> (Antonio's
wife; Rolando's sister-in-law) dressed their wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">They were brought allegedly to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> for further treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we indicated, the trial court convicted both accused and
sentenced them accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused are before the Court on appeal, alleging that the
trial court erred, in essence, in finding them guilty beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused also urge the Court "not to defer" to the
factual findings of the trial court on the ground that the judge who penned the
decision was not the judge who presided over the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that the Court generally defers to the findings of
the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An accepted exception
is where the judge who penned the decision was not the judge who tried the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What must be clarified here,
however, is that the records themselves bare the evidence that points to the
guilt of both accused beyond reasonable doubt, and warrants an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of such findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of one of the victims, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Berenguel</span>, is indeed revealing:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused have shown no ill-motive that may have impelled <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> to lie at the stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies of the prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Berenguel</span>, the brother
of victim <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>, as to the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) his statement to the police did not make
mention of the incident regarding <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>, but only <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>; and (2) he said that at the time of the
incident, he was "in the house,"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
then "at the door"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and then at a "killing place";<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
refer to lapses on insignificant points, which do not negate his eyewitness
account of the two accused in the act of stabbing, repeatedly, the two
victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
declared furthermore, on his alleged omission regarding <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
in his statement to the police, his paramount concern was his brother <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> who was in a worse condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, his "inconsistency" with
respect to his whereabouts does not erase the fact that he witnessed the <span class="SpellE">Marcedonios</span> <span class="SpellE">flagrante</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">What evidently the accused neglected to state is the fact that,
assuming <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> blundered, <span class="SpellE">Conrado's</span>
testimony was enough to support the conviction assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And obviously, the <span class="SpellE">Marcedonios</span>
have offered no convincing arguments to persuade us why we should reject <span class="SpellE">Conrado's</span> testimony as well.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused can not successfully argue that because they were
allegedly "very drunk" they could not have, based on alleged rules of
science, chased the <span class="SpellE">Berenguels</span>, ganged up on them,
and inflicted the stab wounds in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The hard fact is that notwithstanding their intoxicated condition, they
were seen in the act or consummating their dastardly act, a fact self-serving
scenarios and handy theories can not overthrow.</p>

<p class="BODY">We can not lend credence to claims that it was <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Berenguel</span> who in fact
assaulted them, and for which they allegedly in fact sustained stabbing
injuries of their own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the lower
court noted, while the accused presented a medical certificate, they failed to
present the physician to affirm it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
agree that in the absence or the doctor's testimony, it constitutes hearsay
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also agree, as the trial court held, that <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
could not have attacked the two and succeeded in inflicting stab wounds on
them, without the latter putting up a fight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their own narration does not show that <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>,
in allegedly attacking them, did so with treachery and surprise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence shows that the stabbing was done with treachery,
consisting in the <span class="SpellE">Marcedonios</span>' clear effort to harm
the victims with no risk to themselves.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">We can not, however, accept the penalty imposed by the trial
court as to Criminal case No. Q-31389, that is, eight years and one day to ten
years, since the penalty for frustrated murder under Article 50 of the Revised
Penal Code is <span class="SpellE"><b>prision</b></span><b> mayor</b> in its
maximum period to <b>reclusion temporal</b> in its medium period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eight years and one day to ten years is
actually <span class="SpellE"><b>prision</b></span><b> mayor</b> in its medium
period only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the lower court
failed to prescribe the proper penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court therefore Sentences the accused, as far as Criminal
Case No. Q-31389 is concerned, on account or frustrated murder, to eight years
and one day to ten years and one day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
mayor.</p>
