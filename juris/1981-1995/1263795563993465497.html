<p class="BODY">The present controversy addresses itself mainly to the proper 
interpretation of Section 23 of the Interim Rules and Guidelines promulgated by 
this Court, providing:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 23.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Perfection of appeal.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— In cases where appeal 
is taken, the perfection of the appeal shall be upon expiration of the last day 
to appeal by any party."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Particularly, the timeliness of a Motion for Immediate Partial 
Execution is involved.</p>
<p class="BODY">On September 1, 1984, in an action for annulment with damages 
filed by petitioner-plaintiff against private respondent-defendant, the Regional 
Trial Court of General Santos City, Branch XXIII, rendered a Decision in 
petitioner's favor declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale and the Deed of 
Conveyance of Real Properties, subject matter of the annulment action, as null 
and void and, in so far as pertinent to this case, "ordering defendants (private 
respondents herein) upon receipt of this decision to deposit to this Court the 
rentals and/or income due the properties subject of this case from the date of 
filing" (par. 4, <span class="SpellE">Dispositive</span> portion).</p>
<p class="BODY">The Decision was received by private respondents on <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1984</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They 
had, therefore, until <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="10">October 10, 
1984</st1:date> within which to appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="10">October 2, 
1984</st1:date>, or, on the seventh (7<sup>th</sup>) day from receipt of the 
Decision, private respondents filed a Notice of Appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner was served with copy of the Decision 
on <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1984</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Her last day to appeal, therefore, fell on <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1984</st1:date>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="10">October 11, 
1984</st1:date>, or, on the tenth (10<sup>th</sup>) day after receipt of the 
judgment, petitioner filed a Motion for Immediate Partial Execution pending 
appeal of that portion of the judgment, among others, requiring the deposit of 
rentals in Court on the ground that it "necessitates immediate implementation." 
Private respondents opposed the Motion alleging that the Motion for Partial 
Execution was filed after the perfection of their appeal and that no mention was 
made of any good reason to warrant execution pending appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY">The Trial Court initially denied execution pending appeal on the 
ground that it had lost jurisdiction over the case with the perfection of 
private respondents’ appeal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, however, it 
reconsidered, not by way of granting execution pending appeal, but on the theory 
that the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion of the judgment directing 
the deposit of rentals in Court was, in effect, an order of accounting of the 
rentals due so that pursuant to Section 4, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> execution may not be stayed by the 
perfection of an appeal.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1985</st1:date>, the Trial Court issued an Order requiring 
the lessees of the properties, subject of the action, to deposit the rentals in 
Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <i>Certiorari</i>, respondent Appellate Court found the Orders 
of the Trial Court devoid of legal justification on the ground that the judgment 
directing the deposit of rentals in Court is not an order of accounting within 
the contemplation of Section 4 of Rule 39.<span>&nbsp; </span>It further opined that 
the appeal was perfected on <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="10">October 
10, 1984</st1:date>, so that when petitioner filed a Motion for Immediate 
Partial Execution pending appeal on October 11, the Trial Court had lost 
jurisdiction over the case pursuant to Section 23 of the Interim Rules, 
<em>supra</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, it allowed private respondents to withdraw 
whatever rentals had been deposited in Court "either in obedience to the 
nullified orders of respondent Court or by way of consignation thereof." The 
authorization to withdraw was reiterated in a Resolution, dated <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1985</st1:date>, while petitioner's 
Motion for Reconsideration thereof was denied on <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1986</st1:date>.</p>
<p class="BODY">We find that Section 23 of the Interim Rules has been 
misread.<span>&nbsp; </span>The period to perfect an appeal should be reckoned not 
only from the date one party receives a copy of the Decision but also from the 
date the other party had notice hereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this case, the "last 
day to appeal by any party" is October 16.<span>&nbsp; </span>The appeal can be 
deemed to be perfected only upon the expiration of that last day to appeal, 
which is later than the period to appeal of private respondents.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Consequently, when petitioner filed a 
Motion for Immediate Partial Execution on October 11, the Trial Court still 
retained jurisdiction over the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>To rule otherwise would be to 
allow a party litigant to deprive the adverse party of the latter's right to 
move for new trial or for reconsideration or even for execution pending appeal 
by the simple expedient of immediately perfecting his appeal by filing a Notice 
of Appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment under <span>review 
</span><span>is </span>hereby SET ASIDE and this case is hereby ordered REMANDED
