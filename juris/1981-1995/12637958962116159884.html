<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1984">September 5, 
1984</st1:date>, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Borje</span> filed a 
complaint in the Office of the City Fiscal, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, against the petitioners for 
violation of Section 3(f), Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as 
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>The charge alleged 
"the </span>unjustifiable refusal after a lawful demand to the respondent Mayor 
to sign the Business Permit to held cockfight at the <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City Coliseum unless the coliseum comes across and 
settles <span>a promised donation in favor of the Association of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Councils of which his brother Napoleon was the 
President and to whom the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> should be 
given.<span>&nbsp; </span>And this was despite the coliseum having paid in full all 
licenses, fees, and among others, the business permit which had to be signed by 
the Mayor".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="12" year="1984">September 12, 
1984</st1:date>, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Borje</span> submitted 
the affidavits of his witnesses in support of his complaint.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The petitioners submitted their counter-affidavits, dated 
</span><st1:date month="9" day="14" year="1984"><span>September 14, 
1984</span></st1:date><span> and </span><st1:date month="9" day="19" year="1984"><span>September 19, 1984</span></st1:date><span>, respectively, as 
well as documentary evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Deputized Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span>Ozamis</span></span></st1:placename><span> 
</span><st1:placetype><span>City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span> 
started to conduct the preliminary investigation but inhibited himself from 
resolving the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The Office of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> re-assigned 
the case to Deputized Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, also of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, for resolution but she likewise 
inhibited herself.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> ordered the matter 
re-assigned to <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Ibanez, also of 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span>Ozamis</span></span></st1:placename><span> 
</span><st1:placetype><span>City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span>, but 
the private respondent requested for his disqualification, which was 
granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>, through telegram, 
ordered the transmission of the records of the case to the Office of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>, 
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> which "will conduct 
preliminary <span>in</span>vestigation thereon".</p>
<p class="BODY">The case was assigned to Special Prosecutor Eduardo R. Benitez who 
forthwith issued a Resolution on <st1:date month="6" day="7" year="1985">June 7, 
1985</st1:date>, finding enough <em>prima facie</em> evidence against the 
petitioners to warrant their indictment for violation of Republic Act 3019, 
Section 3(f) and Section 4 thereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>The resolution was approved by 
the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="26" year="1985">June 26, 
1985</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">an information</span> was filed against the 
petitioners before the respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> for 
violation of Section 3(f) and Section <span>4 </span>of Republic Act 3019, as 
amended.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="7" day="30" year="1985"><span>July </span>30, 
1985</st1:date>, the petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration and/or 
Reinvestigation of the Resolution of <st1:date month="6" day="7" year="1985">June 7, 1985</st1:date>, on the ground that said resolution is 
without factual and legal basis and that they did not commit any act in 
violation of Section 3(f) and Section 4 of Republic Act 3019, as amended.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This motion was denied for lack of merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>A motion for 
reconsideration of the order of denial filed by the petitioners suffered the 
same fate.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is now stressed by the petitioners that the proceedings 
before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> are null and void because no 
preliminary investigation of the case was first conducted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The petitioners argue that since the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> sought the transmission of the records of the 
case to its office in 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span> to 
"conduct preliminary investigation thereon"<span class="GramE">,</span> it is 
bound to conduct that investigation pursuant to law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It is further argued that the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>, in resolving the case against the petitioners, 
considered evidence not previously made available to the petitioners.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This evidence refers to the sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Bodiongan</span>, the President of the Coliseum, stating that the 
coliseum had no obligation whatsoever to pay P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> 
either to Napoleon <span class="SpellE">Sanciangco</span> or to the Association of 
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Councils.<span>&nbsp; </span>This surfaced only 
upon the transmittal of the case records to the Office of <span>the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, for lack of preliminary 
investigation conducted by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>, the 
petitioners were not given the opportunity to controvert the evidence of the 
complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The absence of preliminary investigations does not affect 
the court's jurisdiction over the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nor do they impair the 
validity of the information or otherwise render it defective; but, if there were 
no preliminary investigations and the defendants, before entering their plea, 
invite the attention of the court to their absence, the court, instead of 
dismissing the information, should </span>condu<span>ct</span> <span>such 
investigation, order the fiscal to conduct it or remand the case to the inferior 
court so that the preliminary investigation may be conducted.<span>&nbsp; </span>(See 
<em>People v. Gomez</em>, 117 </span>SCRA 72, 77-78, citing <em>People v. 
Casiano</em>, <span>1 SCRA 478). <span>&nbsp;</span>In this case, </span>the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span><span> has the duty to conduct the said 
investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>CONSIDERING THE FOREGOING</span></b><span>, the 
</span><span>COURT </span><span>RESOLVED to GRANT the petition and SET ASIDE the 
Resolution of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> dated</span> <st1:date month="6" day="7" year="1985">June 7, 1985</st1:date> and all acts of the 
res<span>pondents subsequent thereto.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> is hereby </span>ordered to <span>CONDUCT
