<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In open court,
complainant Raul Isidro was the lone witness for the prosecution, while accused
<span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amorsolo</span> was the
lone witness for the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
considering their testimonies, the trial court declared –<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"From the foregoing evidence the court finds that on <st1:date year="1983" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1983</st1:date>, Isidro entrusted his
two paintings to accused to be sold for P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;

</span>each with the latter being entitled to a commission of 30% (<span class="SpellE">exh</span>. 1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
agreement was for the accused to remit the proceeds of the paintings if sold or
return them if not sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no
time limit to the agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused was
not prohibited from consigning the paintings.</p>

<p class="2Q">"After first offering them on said date to a Jorge Tee who did
not like the paintings, accused on the following day brought them to the
Heritage Gallery of Mario <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, (sic) where they
were consigned to be sold (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 3 and 2-A).</p>

<p class="2Q">"When Isidro learned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">in
</span>May 1983 that accused had already sold the paintings to <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., pp. 12, 16-18,
30, June 21, 1984), he (Isidro) caused his lawyer Atty. Armando S. <span class="SpellE">Leyva</span>, Jr., <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">to </span>send
accused a letter dated May 18, 1983 demanding remittance of the payment for the

total of P19,000.00 within ten (10) days from receipt of the letter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The letter
was received on <st1:date year="1983" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1983</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, accused was unable to remit the money or return the paintings
as a charge of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was subsequently filed by
Isidro against the (accused) (sic) in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
office.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1983</st1:date>,
accused was able to pull out one of the paintings entitled 'shadows' from the
gallery and brought it to the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office where
he offered to return it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Isidro refused
to accept, insisting that accused return both paintings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As of <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="8">August
 9, 1983</st1:date>, accused could not return the other painting alleging that
it was still with the art patrons of <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He undertook to return it to Isidro the
moment he was assured that the art patrons of <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
would not buy it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further committed
that in the event it would be sold, the payment would he remitted to him by <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> and in turn, accused would remit it to
Isidro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(counter Affidavit of accused
subscribed and sworn to before an assistant fiscal on <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1983</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. D
&amp; D-1, also <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 5 &amp; 5-A).</p>

<p class="2Q">"On August 15, 1983, accused was able to retrieve the other
painting with yellow <span class="SpellE">motiff</span> from <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>
who referred him to J. P. <span class="SpellE">Lomotan</span> who bought the
same, paying accused with a Metro-bank check dated August 15, 1983 payable to
accused for P6,500.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "4") and
promising to pay the balance of P3,000.00 in cash after 15 days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The check, deposited by accused on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1985</st1:date>, bounced the next day
for the reason 'account closed' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"4-B").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused kept (on)
trying to collect from <span class="SpellE">Lomotan</span> but the check was not
made good and the cash (sic) not paid.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1984</st1:date>,
Isidro accepted the painting that accused had earlier offered to return, plus
the amount of P4,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused was
willing to pay the balance of P5,500.00, obviously from the sale of the other
painting he sold to <span class="SpellE">Lomotan</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
pp. 26-29, <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1985</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he never did.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Where a property is delivered to an agent for sale on
commission, and no time is fixed within which he is to make the sale or return
the property, it is the duty of the agent to return it upon the demand of the
owner, and the failure to do so is evidence of the conversion by the agent (<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> on the Revised Penal Code, p. 1579), Vol. 3, 1976,
ed.).</p>

<p class="2Q">"On <st1:date year="1983" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1983</st1:date>,
accused received the formal demand of Isidro to return the painting within ten
(10) days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As he could not immediately
pull them out from <span class="SpellE">Alcan­tara's</span> gallery by virtue of
the consignment, the accused may not be faulted for the delay <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(pp. 1569-70, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

one pain­ing only on <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When however, on <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1983</st1:date>, he was able to retrieve the
other painting, and instead of return (sic) it to the owner as he had committed
to do, accused, for having failed to return the same or pay its value to
Isidro, committed <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appropriating to one's own use includes not
only conversion to one's personal advantage but every attempt to dispose of the
property of another without right (Francisco on the Revised Penal Code, p.
1130, Book 2, Part 2, 2nd ed.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused
no longer had any right to dispose of the painting when he recovered it on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The partial payment of accused on <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="10">October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">9, </span>1984</st1:date>
in the amount of P4,000.00, made subsequent to the commission of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> does not alter the nature of the crime committed nor
does it relieve accused from the penalty prescribed by law (p. 1199,
id.)." (Decision, pp. 13-15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="2Q">Premises considered, the trial court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime charged and hereby sentences him to suffer four (4) months
and twenty-one (21) days of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor to one (1)

amount of P5,500.00 and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="2Q">"SO ORDERED." (p. 15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court, now known
as the Court of Appeals, with the following assigned alleged errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in">The Court a quo gravely erred in holding
that the accused-appellant converted and misappropriated the property of
private complainant for his own personal use and benefit.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in">The court a quo gravely
erred in convicting the accused-appellant of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
despite the lack of evidence to support it.</p>

<p class="BODY">After deliberating on the evidence for both parties, the
appellate court rendered a decision the pertinent por­tions reading as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"There is no dispute that the appellant received two paintings
worth P9,500.00 each, or in the total amount of P19,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
C).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is also no dispute that proper
demand was made upon the appellant for the remittance of the aforesaid amount
within ten (10) days from receipt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of </span>the
letter-demand dated May 18, 1983 which was actually received by the appellant
on June 20, 1983 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
D-1) Exhibit B reads, as follows:</p>

<p class="3Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">'Our client, </span>Mr.
Raul G. Isidro, has referred to us for necessary action the matter of your
non-remittance of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the payme</span>nt
for two (2) pieces of paintings at P9,500.00 each or in the total amount of
NINETEEN THOUSAND PESOS (P19,000.00) which he entrusted to you on consignment
basis.</p>

<p class="3Q">'Although we received a definite instruction from our client to
file the corresponding complaint in court, after he had confirmed your
transaction with Atty. Mario <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> followed by
several (sic) demands for you to remit the above amount, we took it upon
ourselves to defer the same with hope that you might come forward to settle
your account.</p>

<p class="3Q">'Hence, we demand from you to remit immediately the above amount
either to our client or to our office within ten (10) days from receipt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of this letter, otherwise, should you fail to
do so, we will be constrained to file the necessary action against you with all
the attendant damages recoverable without further notice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">'We trust that you will see your way clear towards an amicable
settlement and, thus avoid further difficulties and inconvenience on your part.</p>

<p class="3Q">'Your earlier settlement of the above is deeply appreciated."</p>

<p class="2Q">"There is also no dispute that the appellant failed to pay the
price of the paintings or to return the paintings within the period stated in
the demand.</p>

<p class="2Q">The appellant would insist that in spite of the fact, that he
received the paintings and failed to return them, or to pay the price thereof
upon demand, there were ‘<span class="SpellE">circumstnaces</span> surrounding
the failure of appellant to return the paintings or its value to Isidro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time the demand for the paintings was
made, it was already in the hand of a buyer, Mr. J. P. <span class="SpellE">Lomotan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact was known to Mr. Isidro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, Mr. Isidro saw the check
issued by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lomotan</span> to appellant in payment of the
painting, which unfortunately bounced, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for
reason of ‘account closed,’ 'xx xx xxx' Appellant therefore may not be blamed
or faulted for its failure to return the painting or its value </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">xx <span class="SpellE">xx</span>," </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(p. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Appellant).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">The appellant argues that his liability should be <u>civil</u>, in
nature, and not penal.</p>

<p class="2Q">The crime for which the appellant is charged, was duly proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had received the paintings, in trust, from
the private complainant to be sold on commission basis, with the express
obligation on the part of the appellant to account for the proceeds thereof, or
to return the said paintings, if not sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Demand for the return of, or for the proceeds of, the paintings, was <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> made upon the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He failed to remit the proceeds of, or to
return, the paintings, within the time frame stated in the letter of demand
which he had unequivocally received on <st1:date year="1983" day="20" month="6">June
 20, 1983</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B-1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His guilt for the crime of <span class="SpellE"><u>estafa</u></span> was duly proved.</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED <u>in</u>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Hence, the instant
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> filed by accused with the following
issues presented for Our resolution:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"Whether or not the
acts of petitioner constituted the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">It </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is the position of petitioner that the fact
of misappropriation or conversion has not been duly established by the
complainant, Raul Isidro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
contends that he has not converted the paintings in question as the same were not
devoted to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, he has not misappropriated the same
or the proceeds thereof, as the same were not taken for his own use and
benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner invites the court's
attention to the circumstances surrounding the failure of the petitioner to
return one </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">paintin</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">g</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">s</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">or its value to complainant, particularly the
fact that at the time the demand for the return of the second painting was

(in payment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of the painting)
bounced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact was made known to the
complainant and therefore petitioner should not be </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">faulted </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to private complainant </span>as
partial payment of the painting covered by the bounced check of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lomotan</span> is not in itself an admission of misappropriation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was merely answering for the shortcomings
of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lomotan</span>, at that he could not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pay </span>private complainant the full value
of the unreturned painting in the amount of P9,500.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At most <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">his </span>liability is only civil (so he contends) as the fact of
misappropriation, an essential element of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, has
not been convincingly proven.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Petitioner's allegations
merit consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that the essence of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
thru misappropriation is the appropriation or conversion of money or property
received to the prejudice of the owner (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Ramirez, 9 Phil. 67).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The words
"convert" and "misappropriated" connote an act of using or
disposing of another's property as if it were one's own, or of devoting it to a
purpose or use different from that agreed upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To misappropriate for one's own use includes, not only conversion to
one's personal advantage, but also every attempt to dispose of the property of
another without right (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Panes, 37 Phil. 118).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, complainant delivered his paintings to the
accused due to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his trust in </span>him
since he is the brother of a fellow artist-painter and also because of a
previous business transaction he had had with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When accused-petitioner consigned the same
paintings to a third entity (Heritage Gallery) which is not known to
complainant, accused did not commit an abuse of the confidence reposed upon him
by the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner assumed
(and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">assumption was correct) </span>that
he could do this in view of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">authorization
given him to sell the property and certainly this could include a sale by
consignation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that accused had an opportunity to return the
second <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">painting, </span>still it was
his desire to continue with the sale because he believed that in Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lomotan</span> he had a ready buyer who could make possible the
accomplishment in full of the agency to sell what had been entrusted to
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no desire to appropriate
anything for himself, no intent to defraud or prejudice in any way the
complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Truth to tell, he gave <span class="SpellE">Lomotan's</span> check to Isidro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that it bounced is not the fault of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, accused paid Isidro with the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> own check, even if partially, and he recognized
his obligation to pay the balance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
the premises, it is obvious that no criminal intent or liability exists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, his liability is plainly merely a civil
one, as manifested in the letter of demand dated <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1983</st1:date>, sent to the accused by Isidro's counsel.</p>
