<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. CCC-2873 of the defunct Circuit Criminal 
Court at <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila, appellant MOISES MARCOS, 
together with <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro, Jun <em>alias</em> "John 
Doe" and "Peter Doe," were charged with the crime of kidnapping, said to have 
been committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>That on or about the 20th day of February, 1979 in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of 
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the private individuals, 
conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and aiding one 
another, for the purpose of extorting ransom from Benito Gonzales, father of 
Benedict Gonzales @ "<span class="SpellE">Cocoy</span>" did then and there<span> 
</span><span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously kidnap and 
carry away in a motor vehicle and detain the latter in an isolated hut for two 
(2) nights and one (1) day.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That accused <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos y de la Rosa, 
cooperated in the execution of the offense by previous simultaneous acts, that 
is, by pointing to Benedict Gonzales @ "<span class="SpellE">Cocoy</span>" to his 
co-accused and writing a ransom note demanding the amount of P200,000.00 from 
the father of the victim, Benito Gonzales but were able to get only the amount 
of P20,000.00 as ransom.</blockquote>
<blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Appellant's co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro, 
Jun <em>alias</em> "John Doe" and "Peter Doe" escaped arrest and for this reason 
only appellant <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos was arraigned and 
tried.</p>
<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the court rendered its decision, dated July 24, 1979, 
with the dispositive portion thereof reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court finds the accused 
MOISES MARCOS, GUILTY, beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of kidnapping, as 
charged in the Information, and hereby sentences him with the penalty of Death: 
to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P25,000 and another P25,000.00 
as moral damages and exemplary damages."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution as summarized in the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief tend to establish that;</p>
<blockquote>"At about <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in 
the afternoon of <st1:date month="2" day="20" year="1979">February 20, 
1979</st1:date>, Benedict Gonzales, a 9-year old pupil of the St. Martin de 
<span class="SpellE">Porres</span> Catholic School in <span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, while on his 
way home from school, was approached by three (3) men on board an owner-type 
jeep. On the pretext that the boy's father, Benito Gonzales met an accident, the 
men asked Benedict to go with them to the hospital (TSN., July 24, 1979, pp. 
5-11)."The unsuspecting Benedict went with the three (3) men who brought him to 
an isolated hut situated at <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, about one (1) kilometer from the North 
Diversion Road. At said hut, Benedict was detained for two nights and one day, 
guarded during the day by two of the men (TSN., July 24, 1979, pp. 13-18; p. 
19).""At about 8:00 o'clock p.m. of the same day, Benedict's brother found a 
note (Exhibit A) at the gate of their residence. The note in full, reads as 
follows: 
<p class="2Q" align="right">Feb. 20, '79</p>
<p>MR. BEN:</p>
<p class="2Q">'Our mission in <span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, is to get you 
<span class="SpellE">Mang</span> Ben. But don't worry about your son, just give us 
P200,000.00 cash tomorrow night, if you dislike, you will not see him 
anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.1in;" class="2Q" align="center">INSTRUCTION</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="2Q">Let your driver alone to bring the money. 
Tell him to travel the Highway going to N. <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> see 
our car with red flag, stop on the rear, go down (sic), on the car with hands up 
and with lights on inside the car. Mr. Ben don't tell this to the authority or 
to anybody, if you want to see your son alive. P200,000.00 or your own 
son?</p>"That same night, Benito Gonzales, Benedict's father, sought the help of 
appellant. Appellant is Benito's first cousin and resides just across the street 
from the Gonzales' residence (TSN., July 23, 1979, p. 4).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The next morning, February 21, 1979, appellant and Benito went to 
the house of <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. Cesar Gonzales (Benito's brother) 
who referred them to Atty. Santiago Toledo, a former NBI agent, who, in turn 
advised them to report the kidnapping to the National Bureau of Investigation 
(TSN., July 23, 1979, p. 5).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"At the NBI, Benito was briefed by NBI Supervising Agents Nestor 
Gonzales and <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> 
as to what course of action to take with the advice that Benito should in the 
meantime vie for time by negotiating with the kidnappers to reduce the ransom 
money (TSN., July 23, 1979, p. 5).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"From the NBI, appellant Benito proceeded to the office of <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. Cesar Gonzales at Ayala Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, where appellant advised Benito to disregard the NBI 
original plan. He volunteered to talk with the kidnappers to reduce the ransom 
money to P20,000.00 and proposed the raise the amount through a loan from a 
friend. <span>Benito fearful for the life of his son and having no ready cash at 
the time, readily agreed to appellant's proposal (TSN., July 23, 1979, pp. 
5-6).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"From there, appellant and Benito proceeded to the store of Romeo 
Castro (appellant's friend) in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, purportedly to secure a loan of 
P20,000.00. Appellant alone talked to Castro inside the latter's store and, 
about three (3) minutes later, invited Benito. After the usual introductions, 
Benito believing that appellant was able to secure a loan from Castro, promised 
to pay the same within the week (TSN., July 23, 1979, p. 6).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Thereafter, at about 7:00 o'clock p.m. of the same day, February 
21, 1979, appellant and Benito went home to <span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>. As planned, appellant left purportedly to 
meet with the kidnappers at the highway going to <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> (TSN., July 23, 1979, pp. 6-7).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"At about <st1:time hour="14" minute="45">2:45 o'clock</st1:time> in 
the early morning of <st1:date month="2" day="22" year="1979">February 22, 
1979</st1:date>, appellant together with Benedict, arrived at the Gonzales' 
residence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Amidst the tearful reunion, appellant, when questioned how he was 
able to get back Benedict, related that on his way to <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, he was <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> to stop with a red flag by persons on board a red 
car; with guns aimed at appellant, the persons asked him for the money; 
appellant allegedly handed them the P20,000.00 with an apology that said amount 
was the only money that the family of Benedict could afford, afterwards, they 
proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Novalichas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City where Benedict was detained (TSN., July 23, 
1979, pp. 7-8).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"On March 5, 1979, Benito Gonzales reported the above developments 
to the NBI. Noting some suspicious circumstances in appellant's story, the NBI 
conducted further investigation. The NBI agents questioned not only Benito and 
Benedict Gonzales but also appellant and Romeo Castro, appellant's friend, who 
allegedly loaned the amount of P20,000.00 ransom money. Appellant also pointed 
to the NBI Agents the isolated hut in <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>, 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> where Benedict was detained, and 
reenacted the incident.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"In his sworn statement (Exhibit E) dated <st1:date month="7" day="10" year="1979">July 10, 1979</st1:date> voluntarily given before NBI Agent 
Esteban <span class="SpellE">Libit</span>, appellant admitted that he, together 
with <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro, "Jun" and <em>alias</em> "Peter 
Doe," planned and executed the kidnapping of Benedict.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"After the investigation, <span class="SpellE">tha</span> NBI indorsed 
the case to the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila for the filing of the appropriate 
information against appellant <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro, "Jun" and 
"Peter Doe" (Exhibit G). (<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 76-81).</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">On<span> </span>the other hand, appellant offers as his version of 
the same incident the following:</p>
<blockquote>"Appellant Marcos, 49 years old, married, government <span class="SpellE">pensionado</span> and residing at <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. 
Nino, <span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, 
testified as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That the father of the victim is his first cousin. (TSN., Hearing 
of July 24, 1979, p. 54).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That he<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"> </span>wrote the 
ransom letter (Exhibit A) because he was instructed at the town plaza of <span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> by <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro to write said letter and after <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro and his companions have taken the boy (Benito 
Gonzales) he was instructed to write the ransom letter, (TSN., Hearing of July 
24, 1979, pp. 56-57).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro is his friend while 
the "John Doe" and "Peter Doe” were the companions of <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro whom he does not know. (TSN., Hearing of July 
24, 1979, pp. 57-58).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That he was forced or intimidated to write <span class="SpellE">tha</span> ransom note because if he will not do so, they (<span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro and companions) will get his children who are 
studying in Manila (TSN., Hearing of July 24, 1979, pp. 58-59).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That he was told by <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro that if 
he will not make the ransom note, his. two children will be "<span class="SpellE"><em>madisgracia</em></span>." (TSN., Hearing of July 24, 1979, p. 
64).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro gave him the pen to 
write the ransom note and although instructed to give the ransom note to his 
cousin, he placed the ransom note in the gate of his cousin's house. (TSN., 
Hearing of July 24, 1979, pp. 67-68).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"That he did not report the matter to the authorities because he 
thinks that he can get his grandson. (TSN., July 24, 1979, p. 70). (Appellant's 
Brief, pp. 10-11).</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">In seeking the reversal of the decision rendered against him, 
appellant herein attributes to the trial court its commission of the following 
assigned errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center">"I</div>"THE CIRCUIT CRIMINAL COURT OF PASIG METRO MANILA

and</p>
<p class="2Q">"d) THE DEATH PENALTY CONSTITUTES A CRUEL OR UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT 
PROSCRIBED BY SECTION 21, ARTICLE IV OF THE 1973 
CONSTITUTION."</p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Appellant maintains that his extrajudicial confession is 
inadmissible as evidence against him because the same was obtained from him 
without the assistance of a counsel. He avers that although he waived his right 
to counsel, this waiver is without legal effect as such was made without the 
assistance of a lawyer, a requisite which should have been complied with as was 
stressed in the case of <em>Morales vs. Enrile</em>, 121 SCRA 538 and reiterated 
in <em>People vs. Galit</em>, 135 SCRA 465.</p>
<p class="BODY">The Court in this regard, finds that appellant's protestations do 
not warrant reversal of the appealed judgment. When appellant gave his sworn 
statement before the NBI agent Esteban <span class="SpellE">Libit</span> on July 
10, 1979 he was not then under police custody. He was merely invited for 
questioning so he can shed light on the kidnapping of Benedict. He was even 
allowed to go home after the investigation. Appellant who is a retired First 
Lieutenant in the Philippine Constabulary and who had studied up to third year 
in mechanical engineering, admitted having voluntarily given his sworn 
statement, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E, to the NBI.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is significant to consider that appellant <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos was duly informed of his right to remain 
silent. He was warned that any statement he make may be used against him and 
that he is entitled to be assisted by a lawyer of his choice. From the case 
records, are reflected the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all the foregoing circumstances, the Court is of the 
view that appellant's admissions, voluntarily made and confirmed by him in open 
court during his trial, render worthless the challenge now interposed by him to 
the admissibility of appellant's sworn statement, Exhibit E. The facts and 
'circumstances attendant in this instance, excludes the case at bar from the 
scope and application of the pronouncements made in the case of<em> People vs. 
Galit</em>, 135 SCRA 465 and <em>Morales, Jr. vs. Enrile</em>, 121 SCRA 538, 
which appellant invoked.</p>
<p class="BODY">The findings and conclusions of the trial court receive fullest 
support from the evidence adduced by the prosecution aside from appellant's 
admissions made before the trial court. We find no reason to set aside and 
reject the evidence which the court below had properly appreciated.</p>
<p class="BODY">Consequently, this Court should extend faith and credit to the 
factual findings of the court below that appellant <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos was an active participant and was even the one 
who had inspired the commission of the kidnapping of the son of his first 
cousin. Apart from the extrajudicial statements of the accused, the other 
evidence submitted by the prosecution include the testimony of Benedict 
Gonzales, a nine-year old kidnap victim who attested to and<span> 
</span>confirmed the fact that it was the accused <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos, as his "Lolo <span class="SpellE">Nito</span>" 
who had taken him from the place of detention in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> and brought him back home to his parents. The 
declarations of Benito Gonzales, father of the kidnapped child indicate the role 
played by appellant <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos in obtaining the 
amount of P20,000.00 supposedly to repay the purported loan secured from one 
<span class="SpellE">Romy</span> Castro and which was to be utilized to pay for 
the ransom of the kidnapped boy. All the above mentioned evidence, separate and 
independent from the extrajudicial statement Exhibit E, executed by the 
appellant, are likewise proof establishing beyond reasonable doubt the 
appellant's guilt.</p>
<p class="BODY">Appellant submits that he was an unwilling participant in the 
crime and that he was forced to write the ransom note because of his fear that 
his children in Manila will be hurt by his co-accused. Appellant claims that his 
cooperation was not given voluntarily and therefore he should not be regarded as 
a principal for even assuming that he participated in the commission of the 
crime, his participation was merely that of an accomplice.</p>
<p class="BODY">We cannot give credence to the claim of the appellant that he was 
coerced into writing the ransom note. There is no averment nor is there even 
mention of any such alleged coercion exerted on him when appellant executed his 
sworn statement, Exhibit E<span>, </span>wherein it described the role he played 
in the kidnapping of Benedict Gonzales. What appears is that appellant wrote the 
ransom note while in his residence and without any of his co-accused being 
present. In his extrajudicial statement, Exhibit E, appellant stated:</p>

midnight. The driver must bring with him the ransom money and we will intercept 
him, I mean the money. I also mentioned in that ransom note that along the 
highway, at about midnight he will see a car with a red flag and upon seeing 
that car he must stop and go down hands up and he must light the inside of the 
car."<o:p></o:p></span></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p></o:p></span>To mitigate somehow his criminal 
liability, appellant submits that he merely acted as a "go-between" between 
kidnappers and the victim's father and where there is doubt as to whether one 
participated as a principal or as an accomplice, the milder form of criminal 
liability should be favored. Appellant asks that he be given the benefit of 
doubt and that he be regarded, at most only as an accomplice {Appellant's Brief, 
pp. 19-20).</p>
<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the conclusion arrived at by the trial court 
that appellant's participation in the said felony was as a principal. It was 
appellant who informed his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Castro 
and the other persons named only as "John Doe" and "Peter Doe," that Benito 
Gonzales, father of the kidnapped victim, is among the richest residents of 
<span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>. It was no 
less appellant <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos who pointed out Benedict 
Gonzales to his other co-accused who later duped said boy into going along with 
them on the pretext that the boy's father was then in a hospital. It was 
appellant who wrote the ransom note and he himself placed said note at the gate 
of the house of the father of the kidnapped child. Appellant made it appear that 
he borrowed money in the amount of P20,000.00 from one Romeo Castro which was to 
be used in paying the ransom and although appellant did not actually obtain that 
loan, he nevertheless caused the boy's father to agree to repay that alleged 
loan and this the latter did afterwards. Appellant, by himself, went to <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, where the 
kidnapped boy was detained. He then brought back the latter to his parents in 
<span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>. It is 
undisputed that appellant received from Benito Gonzales the amount of P20,000.00 
which was intended to serve as reimbursement for the money allegedly borrowed 
and which Benito Gonzales was made to believe was paid for the release of his 
kidnapped son.</p>
<p class="BODY">The narration of the kidnapping incident by the herein appellant 
is replete with details which could not possibly be known by anyone else other 
than those actually and principally involved in the kidnapping and in the 
execution thereof.</p>
<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant contends that the death penalty should not have 
been imposed on him because the amount of the ransom money involved is small. He 
maintains that the death penalty constitutes a cruel and unusual punishment, 
disallowed by Section 21, Article IV of the 1973 Constitution.</p>
<p class="BODY">The crime committed by appellant and his co-accused is defined and 
penalized in Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 
Nos. 18 and 1084, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 267 - Kidnapping and serious illegal detention. - Any private 
individual who shall kidnap or detain another, or in any other manner deprive 
him of his liberty, shall suffer the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> to death.</p>

<p>"4. If the person kidnapped or detained shall be a minor, female, or a public 
officer."The penalty shall be death where the kidnapping or detention was 
committed for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other 
persons, even if none of the circumstances above mentioned were present in the 
commission of the offense."</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">There is no question at all that Benedict, the victim, was then a 
minor and that he was kidnapped for the purpose of extorting ransom.</p>
<p class="BODY">Appellant's argument that death is a cruel and unusual punishment 
does not deserve consideration. In <em>People vs. Camano</em>, 115 SCRA 688, We 
already held that the death penalty, as such is not excessive, unjust or cruel, 
within the meaning of that word in the Constitution. In said case, this Court 
stated, citing <em>Harden vs. Director of Prisons,</em> 81 Phil. 741 —</p>
<blockquote>"The penalty complained of neither cruel, unjust or excessive. In Ex 
<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> <span class="SpellE">Kemmler</span>, 136 U.S. 436, 
the United States Supreme Court said that punishments are cruel when they 
involved torture or lingering death but the punishment of death is not cruel 
within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution. It implies there 
something inhuman and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of 
life."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">What can be gleaned from a review of the evidence on record is 
that apparently there was an abrupt and increasing remorse or contrition on the 
part of the herein appellant after the kidnapping was an accomplished fact but 
there no longer was any way of turning back from<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"> </span>his assigned role. Appellant's change 
of heart could have been brought about by appellant's realization of the anxiety 
and suffering inflicted on the parents of the child whose father is the first 
cousin of the appellant. The <span class="SpellE">vaccillation</span> of appellant 
is understandable because, as submitted by appellant's counsel in this case, 
"... appellant is not a professional wrong doer (he has not been guilty of any 
other previous offense)." (Appellant's Brief, p. 23). </p>
<p class="BODY">In our assessment of the facts of this case and upon considering 
the conduct and actuations of the herein appellant, We are inclined to agree 
with the observations of the appellant's counsel <em>de oficio</em>, who went to 
the National Penitentiary to interview the accused. The Court's impression is 
that when appellant <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos began to realize the 
extent of the grief and torment being undergone by the family of Benedict 
Gonzales (the kidnapped child), he must have even at that times, already 
regretted his felonious act and thus he voluntarily returned the kidnapped boy 
to his parents although full payment of the P200,000.00 being demanded in the 
ransom note was not given by the boy's family. It is indicated, that when his 
other co-accused were later grumbling about the small sun of P20,000.00 received 
by them (herein appellant had no share in the ransom paid), appellant then sold 
his car for P5,000.00 and gave this money to his co-conspirators to appease them 
(Q. 65-67, Sworn Statement of Appellant, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E).</p>
<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing circumstances, the Court is disposed to 
accept the urging of appellant's counsel <em>de oficio</em>, that if appellant's 
conviction is sustained, the appropriate penalty that he should suffer must not 
be the extreme penalty of death.</p>
<p class="BODY">Appellant has already been detained for almost eight years now and 
is presently confined at the National Penitentiary awaiting the outcome of our 
review of the judgment rendered by the trial court. The facts of this case tend 
to show that the crime in this case was not the result of any deliberate and 
well formed nefarious conspiracy of a criminal group. It was rather a crime 
clumsily conceived on the spur of the moment. Appellant obviously did not fully 
realize the gravity of the crime he and his companions were embarking upon. 
Thus, We find the extreme penalty of death imposed on appellant, <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos, to be inappropriate. In the view of the 
Court, under the given circumstances in this case, the penalty that should be 
imposed should be reduced to life imprisonment. Furthermore, if the record of 
appellant's behavior while under detention in the National Penitentiary during 
the years he has been imprisoned is satisfactory and indicative of his 
worthiness to rejoin the society of law-abiding citizens, then the proper 
recommendation in his behalf should be made by the prison officials concerned 
for the further commutation of his prison term.</p>
<p class="BODY">The Court also notes that only P20,000.00 was paid by the father 
of the kidnapped child for ransom but the amount of P25,000.00 was decreed in 
the decision of the court below. It should be therefore reduced to 
P20,000.00.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision, being in accordance with 
the evidence is AFFIRMED but with modification, as to the penalty of death 
imposed on the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Marcos which 
is hereby reduced to <em>Reclusion Perpetua</em>. The indemnity to be paid to 
the offended party is also reduced to P20,000.00. In all other respects, the 
said judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>
