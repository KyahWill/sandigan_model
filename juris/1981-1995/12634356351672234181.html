				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Alleging that the respondent court seriously erred in dismissing
Civil Case No. 88-1014 entitled <i>Maria L. </i><i><span style="">Lopez vs. </span>Northwest Airlines, Inc. </i>before it on the ground
that it had no jurisdiction to hear and render judgment therein notwithstanding
the fact that its jurisdiction over the very same suit had long been sustained
and/or settled with finality and conclusiveness by this Court in G.R. No. 91393
entitled <i>Northwest </i><i><span style="">Airlines,
Inc. </span>vs. Court of Appeals and Maria </i><i><span style="">L. Lopez, </span></i>petitioner has come to Us by way of this petition
for review on <i>certiorari </i>to seek a reversal of the said order of
dismissal.  We shall treat this petition
as a special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 65 of the Revised
Rules of Court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner purchased from the private respondent Northwest
Airlines, Inc. (NWA) in New York Ticket No. 8443546771 with bookings for an
airplane flight covering the following destinations:  "New York - Seattle - Manila - Tokyo - New York."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the petitioner made the trip to the Philippines
on the New York - Seattle - Manila leg of her ticket and that her trip back to
New York via Tokyo was confirmed by the private respondent for 10 July
1987.  However, when she went to the
latter's representative in the Philippines on 7 July 1987, or barely two (2)
days before the date of the flight, to reconfirm her booking, she was informed
that she could not be accommodated in view of its cancellation.  Despite her insisting that she be allowed to
take the 10 July 1987 flight as stipulated in her ticket, private respondent
remained adamant; it scheduled her flight for 11 July 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the petitioner filed a complaint for damages
against the private respondent before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Makati,
Metro Manila alleging that in bad faith and utter disregard of her rights as
well as its own obligation under the contract of carriage, the private
respondent unjustly and without good and/or valid cause cancelled her
accommodation in its scheduled flight for 10 July 1987; as a result thereof,
she supposedly suffered mental anguish, embarrassment, humiliation and great
inconvenience.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 88-1014 and was raffled off to
Branch 147 of the said court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 July 1988, private respondent filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint on the ground that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the action under the Warsaw Convention.  Petitioner opposed the motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> On 8
November 1988, the trial court, per Judge Teofilo Guadiz, Jr., handed down an
Order denying the motion to dismiss on the ground that the same is "not
well-taken."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, private respondent filed with the Court of Appeals on
24 November 1988 a special civil action for <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>to
set aside the aforesaid order.  The case
was docketed as CA-­G.R. SP No. 16174.  Private respondent insisted that the trial court is precluded from
exercising jurisdiction over the case pursuant to Article 28(1) of the Warsaw
Convention which provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ART. 28(1).  An action
<span style="">for </span>damages must be brought, at
the option of the plaintiff, in the territory of one of the High Contracting
Parties, either before the court of the domicile of the carrier or of his
principal place of business, or where he has a place of business through which
the contract has been made, or before the court at the place of
destination."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 29 November 1989, the Court of Appeals promulgated its
decision therein, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the instant petition
before Us <span style="">is </span>hereby DENIED."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This denial is anchored on the appellate court's view that
Article 28(1) of the Warsaw Convention prescribes the venue for the different
actions for damages enumerated in Articles 17, 18 and 19 therein, and does not
cover an action for damages arising out of the carrier's absolute refusal, in
bad faith, to comply with the contract of carriage.  Said court further maintained that Article 28(1) was never meant
to exempt a carrier from liability arising from breaches of contract not
enumerated in said Articles 17, 18 and 19.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> It
invoked the decision in <i><span style="">Pan American
World Airways, Inc. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
factual background of which is similar to the instant case, wherein this Court
affirmed the decision of the appellate court awarding damages to the private
respondent therein.  Reliance was
likewise placed on its own decision in </span><i><span style="">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines vs. Tamayo,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">a
case wherein the Court of Appeals ruled that even "off-loading or bumping
off" does not come under the contemplation of Article 28(1) just as
Article 28 thereof should not be interpreted to be a rule on jurisdiction but
of mere venue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the appellate court's decision, private
respondent filed with this Court a petition for review under Rule 45 of the
Revised Rules of Court.  The case was
docketed as G.R. No. 91393. In the Resolution of 21 March 1990, this Court
dismissed the petition for the "failure to sufficiently show that the
Court of Appeals had committed any reversible error in the questioned judgment."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent sought to have this adverse resolution reconsidered.  On 9 May 1990, however, this Court denied
the motion with finality, "the basic issues raised therein having
previously been duly considered and passed upon by this Court in the aforesaid
resolution and no substantial matter having been adduced to warrant the
reconsideration sought."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> Per
entry of judgment which was made in due course, the Resolution of 21 March 1990
became final on 19 June 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, private respondent was compelled to go
back to the trial <span style="">court in </span>Civil
Case No. 88-1014 where it filed its Answer <span style="">on </span>31 August 1990.  <span style="">In </span>the meantime, said case was
re-raffled to Branch 65 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the issues were properly joined, trial on the merits ensued
and was terminated on 15 January 1992.  On said date, the trial court issued an order giving the parties
"thirty (30) days from today to file their respective memorandum (sic)
after which the case shall be deemed submitted for decision."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This 30-day period expired on 14 February 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 July 1992, private respondent filed a second motion to
dismiss Civil Case No. 88-1014<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> on
the ground that the rulings of the Court of Appeals in the aforesaid CA-G.R. SP
No. 16174 and <span style="">this Court in G.R. No.
91393 "cannot stand, and therefore must be deemed overruled and
superseded, by the subsequent Decision"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> promulgated by this Court on 23 June 1992 in
</span><i>Santos vs. Northwest Orient Airlines, Inc</i>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the factual setting of which is

court is bound by the said decision for it "now unquestionably provides
the controlling </span>doctrine concerning the Warsaw Convention and its
provisions on jurisdiction, in accordance with <u><span style="">Article</span></u><span style=""> <u>8</u></span>

The order reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Consistent with the ruling of the <span style="">Supreme Court in </span><i>Augusto Benedicto Santos III vs. Northwest
Airlines and Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 101538,</i> <span style="">where the constitutionality </span>of Article 28(1) of the Warsaw
Convention was upheld, and it appearing clear that the court is not vested with
jurisdiction to hear and render judgment in the present case, this court
resolves to grant defendant's Motion to Dismiss.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Consequently, this case is DISMISSED for want of
jurisdiction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then took this recourse and imputes upon the
respondent court the error adverted to in the beginning of this <i><span style="">ponencia</span></i><span style="">.  </span>She urges Us to set
aside the aforesaid order of the trial court and reiterates the arguments which
she had raised in her pleadings filed in the court below in opposition to the
private respondent's second motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the filing of the Comment to the petition by the private
respondent, the Reply thereto by the petitioner and the Rejoinder to the latter
by the private respondent, this Court gave due course to the petition and
considered the case submitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent filed its Answer to the Complaint in Civil
Case No. 88-1014 after this Court, in G.R. No. 91393, had, in effect, sustained
the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R. SP No. 16174 which dismissed
the former's petition to set aside the trial court's denial of its motion to dismiss
based on the lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter.  None of the parties has attached to their
pleadings filed before this Court copies of the Complaint and the Answer in
Civil Case No. 88-1014.  It is therefore
not clear to Us whether the said complaint contains specific allegations which
may not entirely bring the subject matter within the broad confines of Article
28(1) of the Warsaw Convention, or whether the private respondent (a) had
pleaded in its Answer lack of jurisdiction as one of its affirmative defenses,
or (b) had set up a counterclaim invoking the jurisdiction of the trial court
for specific reliefs in its favor as a consequence of the filing of the
case.  What is sufficiently certain is
that private respondent participated in the said case by presenting and
offering its evidence, and advanced no objection to the trial court's order
requiring the parties to submit their evidence within thirty (30) days from 15
January 1992 and declaring the case submitted for decision upon the lapse of
the said thirty (30) day period on 14 February 1992.  Pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2), Section 15, Article VIII of
the 1987 Constitution and paragraph 11.1, subdivision 11 of Administrative
Circular No. 1 of this Court dated 28 January 1988, the trial court had ninety
(90) days from 15 February 1992 -- or until 15 May 1992 -- within which to
decide the case.  There was nothing more
for the trial court to do except decide the case especially since its 90-day mandatory
period to do so had already expired.  Doubtless, in view of the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP
No. 16174 and Our resolution in G.R. No. 91393, it had at least <i>prima facie </i>jurisdiction
over the case and, therefore, the rendition of judgment therein was undeniably
within its authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined by the
allegations in the complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> and
is not made to depend upon the allegations in the answer or in the motion to
dismiss.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Jurisdiction continues until the case is finally terminated.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
And while jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case may be raised at any
stage of the proceedings as the same is conferred by law,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
it is nevertheless settled that a party may be barred from raising it on the
ground of laches or estoppel.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the decision in <i><span style="">Santos vs. Northwest Orient Airlines, supra., </span></i>promulgated by
this Court on 23 June 1992, cannot be invoked to peremptorily oust the trial
court of jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 88-1014.  For one, there is no indubitable showing that indeed, the factual
antecedents in <i><span style="">Santos</span></i><span style=""> </span>are substantially the same as those
obtaining in this case.  Whether there
exists such an identity would depend largely on the findings of fact which the
trial court must make in its <span style="">decision
in Civil Case No. 88-1014.  It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">quite evident that the trial court has not yet endeavored to do
so.  Moreover, it behooves the trial
court to determine whether the private respondent is already barred from
raising the issue of jurisdiction because of estoppel or laches.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the trial court should have seriously taken into
consideration the earlier case of <i>Pan</i> <i><span style="">American World Airways, Inc. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, supra</span></i><span style="">., </span><span style="">wherein this Court affirmed a decision of the appellate court awarding
damages to the private respondent therein arising from Pan American World
Airways` (PAN AM) refusal to accommodate the latter on PAN AM Flight No. 431
from Sto. Domingo, Republica Dominica, to San Juan, Puerto Rico on 29 April
1973 notwithstanding the fact that said private respondent had a confirmed
plane ticket which she purchased from PAN AM's office in Sto. Domingo.  We have ruled in a number of cases that
posterior changes in the doctrine of this Court cannot retroactively be applied
to nullify a prior final ruling in the same proceeding where the prior
adjudication was had, whether the case should be civil or criminal in nature.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction in granting the second motion to dismiss solely
on the basis of the <i><span style="">Santos</span></i><span style=""> </span>case, and in dismissing Civil Case
No. 88-1014 weeks after its period to decide the same had expired.  The Presiding Judge of Branch 65 should have
denied the motion and decided the case taking into account, however, the decision
in the <i>Santos</i> case and the above observations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the </span>instant petition is <span style="">hereby GRANTED.  The </span>Order of Branch 65 of the Regional Trial Court of

SP No. 16174 and by this Court in G.R. No. 91393.&nbsp; Verily, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ponencia</span> even acknowledges that "private respondent was compelled to go back to the trial court in Civil Case No. 88-1014 where it filed its answer on 31 August 1990" (p. 5, Decision).&nbsp; Therefore, to construe private respondent's demeanor in the course of the proceedings, subsequent to the filing of an Answer, as akin to estoppel is certainly incongruous considering that it was forced by circumstances to pursue procedural measures in order to protect its interests in the case.<br><br>And in view of the recent pronouncement of this Court in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Santos III vs. Northwest Orient Airlines</span> (210 SCRA 256 [1992]) that it is the passenger's ultimate destination that determines the country where the suit against an international carrier is to be filed, I believe that the trial court is now precluded from exercising <span style="text-decoration: underline;">competencia</span> over the case.<br><br>It seems unreasonable and self-contradictory at this point to insist that because we said previous to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Santos</span> that our courts may hear the complaint of petitioner, that the case must go on despite the subsequent pronouncement that our courts cannot validly and legally do so.&nbsp; It would have been a totally different matter, and I would have without reluctance extended my concurrence, if previous to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Santos</span> the case below were decided on the merits and the decision thereafter attained finality.&nbsp; Then the doctrine of the law of the case would apply.&nbsp; Surely, if the case below were decided, granted upon our previous say so, and the decision is thence elevated with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Santos </span>in the meantime having been pronounced, surely and inevitably, any appellate court will vacate the judgment of the trial court for lack of jurisdiction.<br><br>I, therefore, vote to dismiss the petition<br>
