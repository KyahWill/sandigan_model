</span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Asia</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> and America (IBAA) made </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">money

amount of P1,877,053.03.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
consideration of such placement, Commercial Credit Corporation executed a Non
Negotiable Repurchase Agreement whereby it conveyed to IBAA securities issued
by International Corporate Bank (Interbank) with a face value of P2,000,000.00
and with a maturity date of </span><st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">22 April 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
parties (IBAA and CCC) also executed a resale agreement which bound IBAA to

 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On due date (22 April 1981), CCC caused to be
issued to IBAA a Commercial Bank and Trust Co. (CBTC) cashier's check for
P2,000,000.00 which was, however, dishonored upon presentment for being drawn
against uncollected deposits.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="5">18 May 1981</st1:date>,
IBAA advised CCC of the dishonor and demanded cash payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its reply, CCC admitted difficulty in
replacing the dishonored check and proposed payment on a staggered basis, attaching
to the proposal a copy of a Central Bank letter approving its (CCC's) request
for additional standby credit facility to meet its maturing money market
placements.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Due to CCC's failure to meet its obligation despite demands, on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="8">24 August 1981</st1:date>, IBAA filed an action
for recovery of sum of money with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary attachment before the CFI of Rizal, <st1:city><st1:place>Pasig</st1:place></st1:city>,
Branch X (docketed as Civil Case No. L-42585), claiming that:</p>

contracting the debt or incurring the obligation upon which the action is
brought, or in concealing or disposing of the property for the taking,
detention or conversion of which the action is brought; this is an action
against defendant who has removed or disposed of his property, or is about to
do so, with intent to defraud his creditors."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="10">20 October 1981</st1:date>,
the CFI of Rizal issued an order granting the preliminary attachment against
real and personal properties of CCC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="11">19 November 1981</st1:date>, CCC filed a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R.
No. SP-13376-SCA, alleging grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction on the part of the RTC of Rizal in the issuance of the attachment
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the issuance of a <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">status</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>quo</u> </span>order
from the Court of Appeals, deposits of CCC with Bank of the Philippine Islands
and Far East Bank and Trust Co. were garnished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Heavy equipment used in the construction of CCC's building in <st1:city><st1:place>Makati</st1:place></st1:city>
and its office equipment were attached.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two (2) urgent motions and a supplemental pleading were filed by CCC
with the Court of Appeals praying for release of the garnished funds and
attached equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>IBAA reiterated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">its </span>apprehension over CCC's financial
viability and ability to pay;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
besides, IBAA claimed, it (CCC) never had any serious intention to pay at the
inception of the money market placement transaction such that the intention to
defraud the bank (IBAA) was very apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The circumstances in the case at bar fall, according to IBAA, under Rule
57, Section 1(d),<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In setting aside the RTC order of attachment, the Court of
Appeals, in its decision,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> held:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner (meaning, CCC) operates as an on-going
concern.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it is apparent - that it
is in a financial crisis with the Central Bank's grant of an additional standby
credit facility of P20 million in favor of the latter, the attachment of its
property will unduly hinder any transaction where it can regain its financial
solvency to meet its obligations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:

x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is true that petitioner failed to pay the private respondent the
sum of P2,000,000.00 due to its financial difficulty at the time of the
maturity date for the payment of P2,000,000.00 but We find no reason to uphold
the order of attachment issued by the respondent judge on October 20, 1981 where
there is no showing that the petitioner was performing acts to defraud its
creditors or by disposing its assets to the prejudice of its creditors or
persons who may have a claim to its assets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the withdrawal of petitioner's bank deposits in the
Far East Bank and Trust Company (which were then subject to the garnishment
proceedings by the respondent Deputy Sheriff) was intended to finance the
operations of the petitioner as an on-going concern, in payment of wages of its
employees."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the Court of Appeals decision, the present
petition for review was filed by petitioner bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is insufficient merit in the petition.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Essentially, the only question is whether or not the questioned
Court of Appeals decision setting aside the order of the CFI of Rizal, Branch
X, Pasig granting a writ of preliminary attachment upon a complaint for
collection of a sum of money which the respondent CCC allegedly fraudulently
contracted and now has difficulty paying, is in accordance with law or a
reversible error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The purpose of attachment is to secure a contingent lien on
defendant's property until plaintiff can obtain a judgment and have such
property applied to its satisfaction or to make provision for unsecured debts
in such cases where the means of satisfaction thereof are liable to be removed
beyond the jurisdiction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">or </span>improperly
disposed of (by fraud or otherwise) or concealed or placed beyond the reach of
creditors.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that at the time the obligation was incurred by
respondent CCC, the latter already had the fraudulent intent not to pay the
obligation or indebtedness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is not borne out by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand, respondent CCC has not denied that it was
undergoing financial difficulties and had in fact called a creditor's meeting<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
to make full disclosure of its business condition and negotiate for payment of
its outstanding obligations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
also claims there was an incipient misrepresentation regarding respondent's
capacity to pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
found, on the other hand, that there was no dissipation of assets, in fact,
respondent's withdrawal of money from Far East Bank and Trust Co. was intended
to finance its operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inability to
pay, we rule, is not necessarily synonymous with fraudulent intent not to honor
an admitted obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is thus no reversible error in the questioned Court of
Appeals decision which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">we </span>find to
be in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals decision in CA-G.R. No.
SP-13376-SCA is AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">toto</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
