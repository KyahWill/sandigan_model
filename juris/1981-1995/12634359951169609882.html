<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution were
summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Freddie <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Tuban x x x
swore on </span>the stand that about 7 o'clock in the evening of April 5, 1986,
Jun Tumor came to his (Tuban's) house in Upper Matinao, Polomolok, South
Cotabato, to invite him to a drinking party at the house of Elias (henceforth
referred hereon as Ely as it is by this nickname that he is identified in
almost the entire record of the case) Cornea in Upper Matinao x x x.  On April 22, 1986, between 11 o'clock and
noontime, on his way <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">on </span>foot
to the basketball court he met Ely Cornea, <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">who </span>asked him where he was going, to which query he
answered that he was going to the basketball court to watch a basketball game.  Ely Cornea said that as there were still no
people thereat, he would better come with him for a drink at Diding's store,
where they drunk up to 1:30 in the afternoon, at which place they would have
stayed longer had not the store owner, who noticed them to have had already one
drink too many, refused to serve them more.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The two then walked home, but before they parted ways, Ely Cornea
asked him why he did not come with Jun Tumor when he went to his house to
invite him to their drinking party.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x x.  </span>Then Ely Cornea told him that had he only come with them, he
would also have been greatly gratified because they raped Bernardita Abad and
then killed her.  And when he (Tuban)
asked him why they had to kill her when she had not done anything against them,
Ely Cornea answered that they ‘were merely implicated in this matter because
this is the plan of Jun Tumor’.  Ely
Cornea told him that it was he who twisted the knee of Bernardita; that Wennie
Sebugon was the one who cut the breast of Bernardita; that it was Primo Peligro
and Jun Tumor<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">
who killed her, but the four of them raped her.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Freddie
Tuban identified Ely Cornea, Primo Peligro and Wennie Sebugon, who were all his
'barkadas' since childhood, on the dock.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Ely Cornea warned him that if he squealed, he would be the next
victim.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">As they were already </span>drunk,
he suggested that they parted (sic), and so he went home immediately and went
to sleep.  Bothered by his conscience
for several days on what Ely Cornea had revealed to him, because he also had
sisters, he slept one night in the house <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">of </span>Dante Anhao, but still his conscience bothered him
and he could hardly sleep.  So he
decided to tell Dante Anhao that the person who raped Bernardita Abad was <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">his </span>(Dante's) relative <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x </span>x.</blockquote>

to fetch water and that while thereon (sic), he heard a shout which said ‘Jun,
Jun, we will pass here’ (Jun, Jun dire to agi).  Looking up to where the voice came from, he saw Primo Peligro,
Ely Cornea, Jun Tumor, and Wennie Sebugon, who is the brother-in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">-</span>law of Ely Cornea, walking hurriedly
from the place where the dead body of Bernardita would later be found.  When the four saw him, they turned back and

away from the four when he saw them that morning, and the place where he saw

would later be found on April 13, 1986.  He identified the three accused on the dock.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x x </span>Dr. Pasuelo,
Municipal Health Officer of Polomolok, testifying for the prosecution, swore
that he conducted a post-­mortem examination on the dead body of Bernardita
Abad which, at the time he conducted the post?mortem examination, was in
a state of decomposition (Exhibit 'J', 129) and that Bernardita Abad had been
dead for ‘more or less one week’, and that there ‘might be some corruption on
the body of the victim’,  which he meant
'that she must have been sexually attacked'.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x x.  </span>The doctor said that he did not examine the private parts
of the dead Bernardita Abad which had 'some bloating and some mutilation on the
other parts' x x x.  The doctor's basis
in saying that Bernardita had been sexually attacked before she was killed was
‘because of the panty on the leg which is only on one part of the leg’ and that
'there is no positive proof' that Bernardita had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

who raped and killed Bernardita Abad were Ely Cornea, Willy Cebugon, Primo
Peligro and Jun Tumor’ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">x </span>x x He

gone with us last April 5 at about 7 o'clock in the evening then you would have
been happy’ and when Freddie Tuban asked why, Ely Cornea said, ‘we were the

suspected ‘Ely Cornea, one alias Jun and one named Primo Peligro’ as the ones <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">who murdered and raped his daughter,
because these people and ‘all those staying inside the house of </span>Cornea’
entertained a grudge against him.  The
Corneas were his neighbors in Upper Matinao, their houses being only 160 to 200
meters from each other.  Jun (Tumor)
stayed in the house of Maximo Cornea, father of Ely Cornea, but after the death
of his daughter, he had never see him again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Buenaventura Abad ascribed the grudge of those residing in the
house of Maximo Cornea against him to this action taken by him against Maximo
Cornea x x x Buenaventura Abad lost <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">two
</span>goats on March 1, 1986.  Around

was moving towards the direction where his house was and when it got near his
house, it accelerated speed; it ran <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;

what its load was.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The following day, March 2, 1986, he went to the Barangay Captain
of Silway 8 to report what he had observed the night before.  As that was allegedly the seventh case of
thievery reported to him by the people of Upper Matinao, the Barangay Captain
summoned Maximo Cornea <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x x.  </span>The first question the Barangay
Captain put to Maximo Cornea was what was his relation to Jun Tumor, and Maximo
Cornea said that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">was </span>not
related to Jun.  Asked by the Barangay
Captain if Jun Tumor worked with him, Maximo Cornea said, no, Jun had no
work.  And when asked what Jun was
therefore doing in his house, Maximo Cornea answered that Jun was helping <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">him care for his farm animals.  Then the Barangay Captain asked him why a
visitor of his would only come at night, but would not at daytime, but Maximo
Cornea's answer was that his visitor was a good</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> person as he was the companion of
his son Ely, to which x x x the Barangay Captain countered:  'Why would you say that he is a good man
just because he is the companion of Ely Cornea.  Is it not that this Ely Cornea staged a hold-up and wounded Undoy
Ampo?'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution and the defense <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in </span>the case at bar presented totally different versions
regarding the whereabouts of the three (3) accused in the morning of 5 April
1986.  The issues therefore can be
limited to:  (1) the credibility of
witnesses and (2) whether the circumstantial evidence is adequate to overcome
the constitutional presump­tion of innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The settled doctrine in this jurisdiction is that an appellate
court will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court, especially as
to the credibility of witnesses, as the latter is in a better position to
decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and having observed
their demeanor and manner of testifying during trial, unless it is shown that
the trial court overlooked certain facts of substance and value which, if
considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a close and careful review of the records of this case,
including the testimonies of more than twenty (20) witnesses contained in more
than five hundred (500) pages of transcripts of stenographic notes, the Court
finds no compelling reason to disturb the findings of the trial court on the
credibility of the witnesses.  It should
be noted that none of the witnesses for the defense was able to show any ill
motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses to falsely testify against the
three (3) accused.  The trial court
believed the version of the prosecution that the three <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">(3) accused together with one Jun Tumor, who remains at-large,
were with the victim, Bernardita Abad on 5 April 1986, the day she disappeared,
at the area where Abad's decomposing body would later be found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having settled the issue of credibility of witnesses, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">innocence or </span>guilt of the three (3)
accused should now be determined, based on the circumstantial evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">established.  The sufficiency of circumstantial evidence
must be determined upon the particular circumstances of each case.  All the facts and circumstances are to be
considered together as a whole and the totality of these circumstances must be
consistent with the guilt of the accused, if conviction is to be imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No general rule has been formulated as to the quantity of circumstantial
evidence which will suffice.  What is
required is that the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other,
and at the same time inconsistent with the hypothesis that the accused is
innocent, and with every other rational hypothesis except that of guilt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
