No. SP-09081, entitled "Manuel P. <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> </span>and
<span style="">Cristina E. <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span>
vs. Hon. Gregorio Pineda, Presiding Judge, Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch XXI, et al." giving due course to the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by herein private respondents and
annulling the Orders of Judge Pineda dated February 15 and March 13, 1979 in
Civil Case No. 16668.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The antecedent facts, as
gathered from the records, are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">G-P and Co. (G-P, for
short) is the owner of a house and lot located at </span><st1:address><st1:street><span style="">No.138 F. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>
  St.</span></st1:street><span style="">, </span><st1:city><span style="">San Juan</span></st1:city></st1:address><span style="">, Metro Manila, which </span><span style="">was leased to Manuel </span><span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> way back <span style="">on
</span><st1:date year="1961" day="1" month="12"><span style="">December </span><span style="">1, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> for a </span><span style="">period of two years at the </span>rate <span style="">of P275.00 per month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease
contract was presumably extended, at the increased rate of P325.00 a month, and
with option to </span>buy on the <span style="">part
of <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> (Decision, CA, </span>pp. 1-2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 20-21).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1972</st1:date>,
G-P filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> <span style="">suit </span>for non-<span style="">payment</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
rentals from </span><st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="8"><span style="">August 19, 1970</span></st1:date><span style=""> to </span>April, 1972 wit<span style="">h</span> the Municipal Court of San Juan
(Civil Case No. 3369).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> was <span style="">rendered
in favor of G-P and against <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It required the latter to vacate and restore
the possession of the property and to pay the sum of P7, 297.50 as house and
telephone back rentals plus the sum of P325.00 monthly rentals until he vacates
the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 22, 1972, <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> appealed the said decision </span>to the t<span style="">hen Court of First Instance (now Regional
Trial Court) of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, </span><span style="">Branch XXI, docketed therein as Civil Case No. 16668.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 26, 1972, while the case was
pending therein, G-P filed a motion to restore possession of the subject leased
property for failure of <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond and to deposit the monthly rentals during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal as required by Section 8, Rule
70 of the Rules of Court, to stay the execution of the appealed decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="10"><span style="">October
 15, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="">, the then
CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> issued an order directing the issuance
of the writ of execution prayed for in the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> filed a
motion for reconsideration of the said </span><span style="">order after depositing the sum of P1,950.00 representing the accrued
monthly rentals from June to November, 1972 at P325.00 per month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, said motion was denied since
"<span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> has not complied with the mandatory
requirement of depositing the monthly rentals within the first 10 days of each
month" and the non-filing of <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond
which is likewise mandatory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">appears that the
efficacy of the writ of execution lapsed without having been enforced, as the
implementation of the execu­tion order was held in abeyance due to the
negotiation for settlement of the case by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="5"><span style="">May 23, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, G-P filed a motion for issuance of an alias
writ of execution which was granted by the then CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on <st1:date year="1974" day="2" month="8">August
 2, 1974</st1:date>, the Clerk of Court of <span style="">the </span>court <u>a quo</u> informed the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
taking cognizance of the appeal, that there was no transcript of stenographic
notes taken during the proceedings before it because said court “had no court
stenographer yet being employed then.”<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view thereof, the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> set the case
for <b>trial de novo</b> (Petitioner's Brief, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 71).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1975</st1:date>, upon the ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
motion of <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span>, the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
ordered the lifting of the alias writ <span style="">of
</span>execution until after the parties shall have arrived at an ami­cable
settlement (CA <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 65).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1975</st1:date>,
it appearing that the parties failed to arrive at an amicable settlement, the
CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, upon motion of G-P, issued an <b><span style="">order</span></b><span style=""> </span>reviving the alias writ of execution (Ibid., p. 65).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1975</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> filed a petition to lift the writ of
execution but the same was denied in an Order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1975</st1:date> "it appearing that the writ
of execution was issued for non-payment <span style="">x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>of the rentals
that fell due since the perfec<span style="">tion </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span>appeal" <span style="">(Ibid.,
p. 57).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From said order, <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> instituted <i>mandamus</i> proceedings before the
Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. SP 04105) to compel the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to lift said order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="2"><span style="">February 6, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Special First Division</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a><span style=""> of the same
court dismissed said petition (CA Decision, p. 6; Ibid., pp. 63-68).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> filed
several motions for reconsideration but all were subsequently denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first denial was promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="11"><span style="">November
 18, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> and the
second was promulgated</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a><span style=""> on </span><st1:date year="1977" day="12" month="5"><span style="">May 12, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As <span class="SpellE">Mondejar's</span>
motions were all denied, he appealed to this Court, but the First Division of
this Court denied the petition (G.R. No. 45175) for lack of merit on </span><st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="8"><span style="">August
 22, 1977</span></st1:date><span style=""> (Ibid, p.
44).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the finality of the
resolution </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the Court of Appeals dismissing the <i>mandamus</i>
proceedings, G-P, on January 9, 1979, filed with the then Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a motion for the issuance of
another alias writ of execution since the alias writ previously issued had
already expired (Petitioner's Brief, pp. 6-7).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="2"><span style="">February
 15, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, the CFI of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> issued an order grant­ing G-P's motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, a second alias writ of execution
was issued for the execution of the judgment of the Municipal Court of San Juan
(CA <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> filed </span>a <span style="">motion to </span><span style="">set </span><span style="">aside the said </span><span style="">order </span><span style="">but the same was denied in an order dated </span><st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="3"><span style="">March 13, 1979</span></st1:date><span style=""> (Ibid., p. 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason thereof, on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="3"><span style="">March
 29, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span>, joined by private respondent Cristina <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span>, again instituted a <i>certiorari</i> proceeding
with the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 09081 to annul the </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">order of </span><st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="2"><span style="">February 15, 1979</span></st1:date><span style=""> as well as the order of </span><st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="3"><span style="">March
 13, 1979</span></st1:date><span style=""> (Ibid., pp.
1-6).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="2"><span style="">February
 20, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of
Appeals promulgated its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Petition is hereby given due course and the
questioned orders dated February 15, and <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1979</st1:date> are hereby annulled and set aside, with
costs against the private respondents.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The temporary restraining order issued in this<span style=""> </span>case is hereby made permanent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (CA Decision, p. <span style="">5; </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 24).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From said decision, a motion for reconsideration was filed by G-P
on <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1980</st1:date>, but
in the resolution of <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1980</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals denied said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition praying for reinstatement of the dis­puted
orders of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dated February 15 and <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="1">January
 19, 1981</st1:date>, the petition was given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The brief for G-P was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1981</st1:date>, while the <span class="SpellE">Mondejars</span>, in their manifestation dated <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1981</st1:date> stated that their comment
filed on <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1980</st1:date> be
considered as their answer to the petition and brief of petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 78).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the case, G-P filed on <st1:date year="1984" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1984</st1:date>
a motion to set the case for trial on the merits in the same Civil Case No.
16668 with the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Branch
CLX (CA <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 209).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was set for trial on the merits on <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1984</st1:date> during which <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> appeared without counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was reset for hearing on <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="9">Sep­tember 24, 1984</st1:date> but <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> failed to appear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon motion, G-P was allowed to present evidence ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1985</st1:date>,
judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> was rendered in favor of G-P and against <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> ordering the latter to vacate the <span style="">subject </span>leased property and surrender
the possession thereof to G-P (RTC Decision, p. 3; CA <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 220).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1985</st1:date>, the motion for
issuance of a writ of execution was granted (Order, p. 2; Ibid., p. 228) and a
writ of execution was corres­pondingly issued to Deputy Sheriff Romeo de la
Cruz (Ibid., p. 231).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 3 and 4,
1986, Deputy Sheriff de la Cruz levied the prop­erties of <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span>
(Ibid., p. 267), and the <span class="SpellE">Mondejars</span> were subse­quently
ejected from the leased property.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering therefore
that the </span><b>raison <span class="SpellE">d'etre</span></b> <span style="">of this peti­tion has already been resolved, <b>i.e.,</b>
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Mondejar</span> has already been ejected
from the subject property, it is evident that the same has become moot and
academic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under similar circumstances,
this Court held that a case becomes moot and academic and should be dismissed
where the tenant had already vacated the premises and possession thereof had
already been delivered to the owner (<span class="SpellE">Tinio</span> v. Castro,
136 SCRA 658 [1985] ).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A case is
likewise dismissed as moot and academic where a related case had resolved all
the varied issues raised between the parties (GSIS v. CA, 149 SCRA 379 [1987] ).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is a settled rule that
a court will not determine moot questions or abstract propositions nor express
an opinion in a case in which no practical relief can be granted (<span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> Workers Union v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>,
19 SCRA 177 [1967] ; <span class="SpellE">Bongat</span> v. Bureau of Labor
