that the accused persisted in their attempts to arrest and/or pick up the
victim for almost two (2) hours, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">culminating
in the tragedy at around nine o'clock that evening; (2) the fact that the
victim suffered three gunshot wounds, two of which were over the heart and
admittedly fatal, and the third on the left thigh which was not fatal but
sufficient to cripple him; (3) the fact that all three gunshot wounds bore
evidence of gunpowder signs, which is indicative and conclusive of having been
inflicted at close range; (4) the fact that the victim had a 2-inch lacerated
wound on his forehead and another lacerated wound on his right leg which have
not been sufficiently explained but are also indicative of having been inflicted
by blunt instruments, like a flashlight or the butts of a revolver or a
sub-machine gun; and (5) the fact that the alleged injuries of accused <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> could not, by any stretch of imagination, be
inflicted by a bolo allegedly wielded by the victim, since they are quite
superficial in degree, located in the most improbable places and may even have
been self-inflicted to justify </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a

<p class="BODY">Tested by this standard, the means employed by <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> in repelling the attack were, under the
circumstances, both reasonable and necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He initially tried to defend himself by pushing the rocking <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">c</span>h<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">air toward <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span>
but when that proved futile and he (<span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span>) was
caught in a very precarious position, i.e., his back was on the floor and <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span> kept flailing at
him with the bolo, he had no other choice but to use his revolver to defend
himself against the attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, there was no opportunity for <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span>
to carefully take aim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He just
discharged his weapon at the deceased in the hope that such would save him from
any further injury or death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It must also be borne in mind that the rule is that the
reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel or prevent the attack
depends upon the imminent danger of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">injury,
not on the harm actually done to the accused [</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> v. </span><span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">9 Phil. 367 (1907).] Thus, that <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> escaped serious injuries does not necessarily
imply that the means he used to repel the attack were unreasonable and
excessive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that the act
of <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span> of
attacking <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> with a bolo was a very real
danger to his life that the latter had to repel the best way he can.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the gunshot wounds he inflicted </span>on
<span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Leopoldo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span> proved to

the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3. Then, the lack of sufficient provocation on the part of <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> is too plain to even doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He, together with Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Alampayan</span> had been tasked by his superior to apprehend <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span> upon complaint of
his own father and brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
petitioners herein, when they went to apprehend the deceased, were in the
performance of their official duties as peace officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And when they reached the house where <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span> was hiding, <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> tried to coax <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Potane</span> into coming out of the house, but the latter
would not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only when <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span>, who was his childhood friend, to enter the
house that he did, followed by Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Potane</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> was
about to take a seat, definitely a non-provocative act, when he was suddenly
attacked by <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span>
with a bolo.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As consistently argued by the Solicitor General before the Court
of Appeals and this Court, all the elements of self defense are present in the
instant case:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">. . . </span>(a) [T]here was
unlawful aggression on the part of the victim which was a real and imminent
threat to the life of Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Masipequiña</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim was
brandishing a bolo which he did use in fact to hit the latter; (b) <span class="GramE">The</span> use of his revolver to repel the aggression was a
reasonable necessity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His life already
exposed to danger in the face of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>continuous
assault, it is likely that had he not shot the victim, he would have been
killed, considering the deranged mind of the aggressor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, after he shot the victim, he ran
away to avoid being hit farther (sic), an act obviously inconsistent with <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>deliberate intent to kill; (c) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Pat. </span><span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span>
did not provoke the victim into attacking him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, before he went inside the house, he asked <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
to come out to talk things over.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He even
asked for a drink.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only when the
victim himself asked Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Masipequiña</span></span><span class="GramE"> to go up the house that the latter entered the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>[Manifestation and Motion In Lieu of
Respondent People's Brief, p. 12; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 115.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We also hasten to add that, as in the case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Boholst</u></span><u>-Caballero,</u> <u>supra</u>, we
accord special significance to the wounds inflicted on the deceased in finding
that the elements of self-defense had been established.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span> <span class="SpellE">Melicor</span>, who conducted the post-mortem examination on the
body of the deceased, the trajectory of the two chest wounds indicate that the
person who fired the shots was in a lying and lower position while the deceased
was then standing [TSN, <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="9">September 2,
 1976</st1:date>, pp. 5-6, 10.] This corroborates petitioner <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña's</span> testimony that he had his back to the floor
when he fired at the victim who was attacking him with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the wounds bore traces of
gunpowder, indicating the proximity between the person who fired the shot and
the deceased, also support <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña’s</span> testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the elements of self-defense had been established to
exculpate petitioners from the charge of homicide, the next question that
arises, albeit only incidentally, is whether or not <span class="SpellE">Alampayan</span>
could be separately convicted of the lesser offense of less serious or slight
physical injuries for the gunshot wound he inflicted on <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Potane's</span> thigh.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, we refer to Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 11.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Justifying</u> <u>circumstances</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- The following do not incur any criminal
liability:</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> *<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Anyone who acts in
defense of the person or rights of a stranger, provided that the first and
second requisites mentioned in the first circumstance of this article are
present and that the person defending be not induced by revenge, resentment, or
other evil motive.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> *<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the elements of defense of stranger are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) the person
defending be not induced by revenge, resentment, or other evil motive.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case,
that there was unlawful aggression on the part of <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Potane</span> had been adequately established, as discussed
earlier with regard to the circumstance of self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Then, that the means
employed by <span class="SpellE">Alampayan</span> in trying to prevent <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span> from further attacking
<span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> with a bolo were reasonable is clearly
evident, as <span class="SpellE">Alampayan</span> only shot at <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane's</span> thigh to
prevent him from further pursuing <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span> who was
trying to escape <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane's</span>
attack.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Finally, that <span class="SpellE">Alampayan</span> was not motivated by any evil motive is shown by
the fact that he, together with <span class="SpellE">Masipequiña</span>, only
proceeded to the place where the incident happened to look for <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span> because they had
been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ordered by their substation
commander to apprehend <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span>
who had shown signs of mental derangement and had threatened his relatives with
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the two policemen were in the performance of their official
and lawful duties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This, the performance of duties, brings to fore another
circumstance that would justify <span class="SpellE">Alampayan's</span> wounding
of <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span>, for the
same Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code exempts from liability "[a]<span class="SpellE">ny</span> person who acts in the fulfillment of a duty or in the
lawful exercise of a right or office" (Art. 11, <span class="SpellE">para</span>.
5.] Thus, in one case, the Court acquitted the accused police officers even if
their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">acts </span>constituted the
crimes of discharge of firearm and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lesiones</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>graves</u> </span>and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">menos</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>graves</u>, </span>inflicted upon persons
facing criminal charges who were trying to resist arrest, because the accused
officers were in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">performance of
their official duties [U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Resaba</span>, 1 Phil. 311
(1902).]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the small lacerated wounds on <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Potane's</span> forehead and right leg, which the trial
court and the Court of Appeals found suspicious, can be explained by the fact
that <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Potane</span>
dropped to the ground after <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he was shot
on the thigh by <span class="SpellE">Alampayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing on the record to support the
conclusion that the wounds were inflicted by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">flashlight or gun butt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, this Court, on the basis of the same facts found by the
Court of Appeals, has arrived at a different conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Principally, the Court of Appeals affirmed
the trial court’s decision after concluding that one of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">elements of self-defense, i.e., reasonable
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the attack, was
lacking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after a careful
consideration of the undisputed facts and the rule on self-defense by police
officers enunciated in </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
