				<H3>ATTY. TEODORO V. CABILAN & ALEJANDRO A. PARALISAN, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. JUDGE JOSE R. RAMOLETE & PROVINCIAL/CITY JAIL WARDEN OF CEBU CITY, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction seeking the annulment of the <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1976</st1:date> Judgment of Hon. Jose R. <span class="SpellE">Ramolete</span> in Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">CU-1388
declaring herein petitioners guilty of direct contempt of court sentencing them
to suffer the penalty of ten (10) days imprisonment.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Herein respondent judge is the presiding judge in Criminal Case
No. CU-1388, and herein petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Cabilan</span> is the private prosecutor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Alejandro A. <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span>
is the husband of Norma Yap <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span>, one of the
prosecution witnesses who was ordered arrested by respondent judge for failure
to attend the scheduled hearing of the said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span>
wrote a letter to respondent judge, explaining her failure and attached an
unverified medical certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="3">March
 29, 1976</st1:date>, the prosecution presented an illegible <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of <span style="">a </span>supposed
Deed of Sale of a truck executed by the complainant in favor of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabilan</span>, as private prosecutor, moved for the production of
the original which is being kept in the same building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge granted the motion and
ordered a ten minute recess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecuting
fiscal, petitioners and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span> went to the <span class="SpellE">Notarial</span> Division to search for the original of the
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, upon instruction
of the fiscal, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span> returned to the
courtroom to watch the<span style="">ir </span>exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, respondent judge
allegedly approached him and a heated exchange of words transpired between
them, the details of which are contained <span style="">in
an </span>affidavit <span class="SpellE">Annex"A</span>" filed later on
March 30, by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabilan</span> attached to a motion
to disqualify respondent judge from further hearing the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portions of the said affidavit,
read:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style=""> </span>The
Honorable Presiding Judge, upon seeing the affiant sitting on the bench walked
back and forth towards said affiant and then, with a pointed finger directed to
affiant said, ‘you, you where is your wife?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I will have her arrested, I do not accept that kind of medical
certificate she submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will order
the Sheriff right now to detain your wife,’ in a voice so loud as if affiant
were his notorious enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Drowned by
extreme <span class="SpellE">humilation</span>, shame and amazed by the violent
attitude of said judge, the affiant rushed up to the Judge and in a loud voice
also asked, ‘Judge, do you have personal grudge against my wife and my family
and why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why do you shout at me?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not a party to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your show of partiality is conduct unbecoming
of a Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are you interested
personally in this case?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have not seen
a Judge acting like this.’ I further told him that his partiality is very
apparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Since the start of the trial
in this case, you have been threatening witnesses for the prosecution.' After
uttering those words, I left out of the court room and the Honorable Presiding
Judge followed me and threatened me with arrest and called the Sheriffs
available in the vicinity.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style=""> </span>Since
the start of the trial of this case almost a year ago, I noticed suspicious
behavior of the Honorable Presiding Judge like allowing counsel for the accused
and even the accused himself to enter his chambers without the presence of the
Fiscal and/or private prosecutor.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style=""> </span>Personally,
I have no intention of intervening or appearing as witness in this case
although I know the fact hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also
know the questionable acts of accused especially Romeo <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But after reading in the papers that the
Honorable Presiding Judge is fond of issuing illegal orders like that <span class="SpellE">Tanhu</span> Case as enunciated by our Supreme Court, I got
interested in said Judge because my wife was also ordered arrested by her
failure to attend the hearing of this case as a mere witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believed that the order of arrest is
another illegal order because I believe that my wife's failure to attend a
trial as a witness is NOT direct contempt but an indirect one instead of
arrest, she should merely be cited for contempt.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style=""> </span>In
my observation, by the conduct of the Honorable Presiding Judge which he
demonstrated to me as above-stated, he is not only fond of issuing illegal
order but is tyrannical, oppressive, whimsical and capricious when he feels
like tilting the scales of justice in favor <span style="">of </span>a party in the case adverted to under trial.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style=""> </span>I
feel that taxpayers of this province wherein the Honorable Presiding Judge is
sitting should at least be respected in their rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tax payers expect fairness in the
dispensation of justice." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 13)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge, finding the allegations in the said affidavit
contemptuous, prepared the herein questioned judgment, but on <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1976</st1:date>, the same was
promulgated only to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span> because
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabilan</span> was then in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span>
was escorted to the City Jail and had already served the sentence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1976</st1:date>,
petitioners filed the instant petition in this Court, and on the same date, the
Second Division of this Court resolved to issue a temporary restraining order,
and to order the immediate release of the petitioners (Ibid., p. 36-A).</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue in this case is whether or not respondent judge
erred in declaring herein petitioners guilty of direct contempt of court and
sentencing them to suffer the penalty of ten (10) days imprisonment.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The answer is in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the petitioners that respondent judge
gravely abused his discretion in ordering the incarceration of the petitioners
without preferred charges, considering that respondent judge implied in his
order that the charges of the petitioners were unsubstantiated (Par. 2,
Judgment, Annex "E"); that it may <span style="">be </span>that the contempt contemplated by respondent judge was an
indirect contempt; that it was next to impossible to substantiate the charges
in the motion for disqualification because petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span>
was immediately placed under arrest and sentenced to jail without charges; and
that the acts of respondent judge were highly arbitrary and derogatory to his
oath to hear before he condemns and to render justice to anyone regardless of
his station <span style="">in </span>life.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention is untenable.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it should be stated that this Court has repeatedly
declared that the power <span style="">to </span>punish
for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to the preservation of
order in judicial proceedings and to the enforcement of judgments, orders, and
mandates of the court, and consequently, to the due administration of justice (<span class="SpellE">Halili</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Court
of Industrial Relations, 136 SCRA 112, 135 [1985], citing the cases of Slade
Perkins vs. Director of Prisons, 58 Phil. 271; In re Kelly, 35 <span style="">Phil. </span>944; Commissioner of Immigration
<span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>,
20 SCRA 1241; and <span class="SpellE">Montalban</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Canonoy</span>,
38 SCRA 1).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Rules of Court,
contempt is classified into direct and indirect contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Direct contempt is committed in the presence
of or so near a court or judge and can be punished summarily without
hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indirect contempt is not
committed in the presence of the court and can be punished only after hearing
(People v. Navarro, 121 SCRA 707, 710 [1983]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> vs. Castro (136 SCRA 453,
458 [1985]), this Court ruled that if the pleading containing derogatory,
offensive or malicious statements is submitted in the same court or judge in
which the proceedings are pending, it is direct contempt because it is equivalent
to a <span class="SpellE">misbehaviour</span> committed in the presence of or so
near a court or judge as to interrupt the administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was reiterated in the case of
Ante vs. <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> (162 SCRA 780 [1988]), where it was
held that contemptuous statements made in the pleadings filed with the court
constitute direct contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the basis of the judgment for contempt of
court is petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paralisan's</span> affidavit which was
attached and made as an integral part of the motion for disqualification filed
by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabilan</span> which therefore falls squarely
under the above ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the claim of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabilan</span>
that the affidavit <span style="">was </span>modified
by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span> and that he discovered the
insertion of the derogatory remarks only upon his return to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City from <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City, suffice it to say that aside
from the arguments presented by respondent judge to the contrary, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabilan</span>, as counsel of record, has control of the
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever steps his client
takes should be within his knowledge and responsibility (<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
Mineral Reservation Board vs. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, 31 SCRA 1, 23
[1970]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, considering that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabilan</span>
has been practicing for nineteen (19) years and this is the first time that he
is charged with contempt of court, and considering that the power to punish
contempt should be exercised on the preservative and not on the vindictive
principle with the corrective rather than the retaliatory idea of punishment
(Baja vs. <span class="SpellE">Macandog</span>, 158 SCRA 391 [1988]), imposition
of a fine of P500.00 without imprisonment would be enough (<span class="SpellE">Caniza</span>
vs. Sebastian, 130 SCRA 295 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Paralisan</span>
having already served his sentence, this case <span style="">is </span>moot and academic insofar as he is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the instant petition is hereby
DISMISSED, but the questioned judgment of <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1976</st1:date> is MODIFIED by changing the sentence of ten
(10) days imprisonment to <span style="">a </span>fine
of P200.00 without imprisonment.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
