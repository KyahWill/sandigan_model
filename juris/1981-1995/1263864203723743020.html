</span>On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">12 May 1983, his aunt, Fe
Cruz, filed a petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> on his behalf, alleging
that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a) the sentence imposed upon him
was unlawful and excessive; b) he was denied due process because the trial was
held only in one sitting and the defense was not allowed to present additional
witnesses; and c) the person who represented him at the trial was not a lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution dated <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="12">3
 December 1984</st1:date>, the Court dismissed the petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
after considering the same with the return to the writ submitted by the
Solicitor General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it resolved
"to consider the said accused to have filed a timely notice of appeal; to
REQUIRE the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>to
elevate the records of Criminal Case No. 81-913-P to this Court within ten (10)
days from notice; and to ALLOW the accused to post a bail bond of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for his provisional release."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The parties subsequently submitted their respective briefs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dispensing with the testimony of the other defense witnesses
who were only intended to corroborate the averment of the accused that he had
been to several discotheques before his apprehension, the trial court was not
acting arbitrarily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial judge had
the right to control the conduct of the trial and to bar unnecessary testimony,
such as that intended merely to corroborate relatively unimportant <span class="GramE">matters, that</span> would only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">unnecessarily delay the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
People v. <span class="SpellE">Barabasa</span>,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> we held that suppression of that kind of
evidence "did not deprive the accused of any substantial right" as
"the evidence was merely cumulative and unnecessary because it would not
have affected the result of the case in the least."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The mere fact that the trial was concluded in one sitting only is
not necessarily indicative of irregularity or inordinate haste.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If all the evidence needed by both<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> parties could be presented by them </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that single session, there is no reason why any resetting had to be
made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As for the circumstance that the defense counsel turned out later
to be a non-lawyer, it is observed that he was chosen by the accused himself
and that his representation does not change the fact that <span class="SpellE">Elesterio</span>
was undeniably carrying an unlicensed firearm when he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">arrested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, he has
since been represented by a member of the Philippine bar, who prepared the
petition for </span><u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">and the appellant's brief. </span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees, however, that Judge Enrique <span class="SpellE">Agana</span>
w<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span>exceptionally careless, if
not deliberately <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">high-handed, when he
immediately after the trial dictated his decision in open court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One may well suspect that he had prejudged
the case and had a prepared decision to foist upon the accused even before the
submission of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>And what
is worse is that the decision was <u>wrong</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The elements of the offense punished by General Order No. 6 in
relation to Par. 2, Presidential Decree No. 9, as amended, are first, the
carrying of a firearm <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">outside one's
residence, and second, the motive for such act, which is "in furtherance
of or to abet, or in connection with subversion, rebellion, insurrection,
lawless violence, criminality, chaos or public disorder."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A reading of the information filed against the accused will readily
show that the second element of the imputed crime is not alleged at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All that is averred is that <span class="SpellE">Elesterio</span>, on the date and place indicated, had in his
possession and was carrying outside his residence <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a firearm </span>and two live bullets without the proper permit or
authorization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is only the first
element.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no allegation in the
information that the accused was carrying the weapon outside his residence for
the purposes mentioned in the laws supposedly violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">This omission was all too obvious, and it is a wonder that the
trial judge did not see it at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps he did not choose to see it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In any event, it is clear that the accused could not have been convicted
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>violation of General Order
No. 6 in relation to P.D. No. 9, par. 2, and so should not have been sentenced
to the severe penalty of life imprisonment.</p>

<p class="BODY">But all this notwithstanding, the accused-appellant is not
entirely guiltless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, although his
act is not punishable under the laws invoked by the prosecution, it is undeniable
that it comes under the provision of Section 2692 of the Revised Administrative
Code, as amended by Rep. Act No. 4, for illegal possession of firearms.</p>

<p class="BODY">This provision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>SEC. 2692.</i></span><i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlawful manufacture, dealing in,

and seventy-seven </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">to </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">nine hundred and six, inclusive, of this
Code, as amended, shall, upon conviction, be punished by imprisonment for a
period of not less than one year and one day nor more than five years, or both
such imprisonment and a fine of not less than one thousand pesos nor more than
five thousand pesos, in the discretion of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the article illegally possessed is </span>a

bazooka, machine gun, submachine gun, hand grenade, bomb, artillery of any kind
</span>or </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ammunition exclusively

five years nor more than ten years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
conviction under this section shall carry with it the forfeiture of the
prohibited article or articles to the Philippine Government.<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The possession </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of </span>any
instrument or implement which is directly useful in the manufacture of firearms
or ammunition on the part of any person whose business or employment does not
deal with such instrument or implement shall be "prima facie" proof
that such article is intended to be used in the manufacture of firearms or ammunition.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under this provision, mere possession of an unlicensed firearm is
<span class="SpellE"><u>malum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>prohibitum</u></span>
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>punishable regardless <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>lack of criminal intent or proof of
the ownership of the firearm by another person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even if it were not, the accused in the case at bar still has not been
able to explain his possession of the revolver short of the unsupported
statement that it had been handed to him by one Ray <span class="SpellE">Arong</span>
who, by his own testimony, was <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>casual
acquaintance he had met only two days earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He does not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">even explain why he
received the gun when it was for no apparent reason shoved on him by the said <span class="SpellE">Arong</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">is </span>well-settled that the nature and cause of the accusation are
determined not by the name given to the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>offense
but by the description of the manner and circumstances in which it was
committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The designation of the
offense or of the law violated is a conclusion of law made by the prosecuting
officer but this is not binding on the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That conclusion must ultimately be made only by the court itself after
the trial and following its own ascertainment of the facts needed to constitute
the elements of the crime attributed to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If an essential element is not alleged to
prove a graver crime, no conviction <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> may be
rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, if the elements
proved constitute <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

is justified although it is the higher <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">offense
that is alleged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is
the recitals of the facts of the commission of the offense, and not the
nomenclature of the offense, that should determine the crime being charged in
the information.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

where the failure of the information to allege that the murder had been committed
with the use of an illegally possessed firearm removed it from the coverage of
P.D. No. 9 in relation to G.O. No. 6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

established at the trial) which were sufficient to warrant the conclusion that
the offense committed by the accused was violation of Section 2692 of the
Revised Administrative Code as amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He should therefore have been meted the penalty prescribed therein, not
the sentence of life imprisonment for violation of the presidential decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a period of not less
than one year n<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">or more </span>than five
years and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
fine </span>of not less than P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> nor more than
P5,000.00 in the discretion of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The recommendation of the Solicitor General, considering the facts and
circumstances of this case, is "an indeterminate penalty of imprisonment
from three years and one day as minimum to five years as maximum and a fine of
P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, deducting from the sentence such period of
detention, if any, to which the accused may be entitled." But since the
records show that he has been under detention since 1983, or for more than the
maximum sentence imposable on him, there is no question that he is entitled to
be released immediately upon payment of the fine, as an indispensable part of
the penalty, which we hereby fix at P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the accused is declared guilty of Illegal
Possession of Firearms under Section 2692 of the Revised <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Administrative Code as amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as he has been </span>detained for
more than the maximum period of imprisonment imposable for the offense, he is
hereby ordered released immediately upon payment of the fine of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>
