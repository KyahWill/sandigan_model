This is a petition for review of the decision of the Employees' 
Compensation Commission in ECC Case No. 1924, of October 21, 1982 
affirming the decision of the Government Service Insurance System which 
denied compensation benefits to herein petitioner Gregorio Medina under 
the provisions of the New Labor Code for permanent total disability.
<p>
Petitioner Gregorio Medina had served the government since 1947.  At the
 time of his retire­ment on December 1, 1980, he was holding the 
position of a senior trade promotion and regulation officer at the 
Bureau of Domestic Trade assigned in Batangas City (p. 8, rec.).
</p><p>
The records disclose that on July 18, 1980, petitioner attended a 
conference at their head office in Quezon City and on his way home on 
the same date at 5:30 P.M., he met an accident at Barrio Payapa, Lemery,
 Batangas.  As a result, he sustained head injuries medically described 
as subdural hematoma, fronto parietal (R) and under­went craniotomy at 
the Makati Medical Center.  He was confined from August 29 until 
September 11, 1980 (p. 8, rec.).
</p><p>
Due to the nature of his injury, petitioner was forced to retire at the 
age of 55 years.  He received the amount of P45,516.53 as retirement 
benefits (p. 14, rec.).
</p><p>
Thereafter, petitioner filed a claim for disability compensation under 
P.D. 626, as amended, with respondent GSIS.  He was granted income 
benefits amounting to P1,500.00 corresponding to temporary total 
disability.  Petitioner protested this decision and his case was 
re-studied.  The respondent GSIS re-classified petitioner's disability 
into permanent partial disability and granted him additional income 
benefits in the amount of P14,634.60 covering a period of 15 months, 
from July, 1980 to September, 1981.  Petitioner received a total award 
amounting to P16,134.60 (pp. 14-15, rec.).
</p><p>
Petitioner filed a second motion for recon­sideration which respondent 
GSIS denied, but reimbursed petitioner's hospital expenses in the amount
 of P5,708.22 (pp. 14-15, rec.; p. 15, rec.).
</p><p>
When the third and final motion for recon­sideration was again denied, 
petitioner appealed to respondent Employees' Compensation Commission.
</p><p>
Respondent ECC affirmed the findings of re­spondent GSIS and pertinent portions of the deci­sion state the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "After carefully weighing the facts of the case and the evidence 
submitted, we concur with the respondent System.  Indeed, appellant's 
present physical condition does not to our mind warrant an award of PTD 
benefits not­withstanding the certification of his attending physician. 
 On the contrary, his disability -- functional loss due to hemiparesis 
-- is rated only as permanent partial (PPD) under the group of 
non-scheduled disabilities with a percentage rating of 25% non-scheduled
 disability (NSD).  However, the period of 15 months should be increased
 to 19 months pursuant to Sec. 7 of PD 1368, further amending PD 626, as
 amended. </p>
  <p> "Inasmuch as appellant had already received the benefits 
corresponding to the above-stated period in the total amount of 
P14,634.60, appellant should be further entitled to the remaining four 
(4) months or the amount of P3,902.56" (pp. 13-14, ECC rec.; p. 16, 
rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, this petition.
</p><p>
The only issue to be resolved is whether petitioner's disability would 
entitle him to compensation benefits corresponding to permanent total 
disability under Article 192 of the New Labor Code or to permanent 
partial disability under the group of non-scheduled disabilities 
established by the GSIS.
</p><p>
Petitioner contends that based on the findings of his attending 
physician, Dr. Romeo Gustilo, a well-known neurologist and chairman of 
the Department of Neurological Sciences at the Makati Medical Center, 
his disability was classified by said doctor in a guarded prognosis as 
total disability and that because of an extensive hemorrhagic pathology,
 he may, in the future, develop mental and neurological deficits.
</p><p>
With such findings, petitioner avers that he suffered mental lapses 
which forced him to seek an early retirement on December 1, 1980 at the 
age of 55 years.  He asserts that considering that he was forced to 
retire from the service due to his inability to continue with his work, 
he should be entitled to benefits due for permanent disability (Galang 
vs. WCC, 72 SCRA 454).  An employee forced to retire ahead of his 
compulsory retirement, not due to old age, but due to his illness, is 
entitled to compensation for the remaining days before his retirement, 
aside from his retirement benefits (Cayaba vs. WCC, 102 SCRA 346; 
Hernandez vs. WCC, 14 SCRA 219).
</p><p>
Furthermore, petitioner contends that from the time he retired on 
December 1, 1980 up to the present, more than 120 days had elapsed and 
under Article 192 of the New Labor Code, a disability lasting 
continuously for more than 120 days is compensable as a permanent total 
disability.
</p><p>
He also contends that he has not been able to work since the time he 
retired.  Permanent total disability does not mean a state of absolute 
helplessness, but means disablement of an employee to earn wages in the 
same kind of work, or work of similar nature, that he was trained for or
 any work which a person of his mentality and attainments could do 
(Riesenfield X Maxsell, Modern, p. 301, cited in Quiazon and Fernandez, 
Labor Law Series, Vol. IV, p. 87, 1964 ed.).  Permanent total disability
 means an incapacity to perform gainful work which is expected to be 
permanent.  This status does not require condition of complete 
helplessness (Marte vs. ECC, 96 SCRA 884).  Evidence that claimant has 
been able to earn occasional wages or perform certain kinds of gainful 
work does not necessarily rule out a finding of total disability nor 
require that it be reduced to partial disability (The Law of Workmen's 
Com­pensation, A. Larson, Vol. II, p. 25, 1975 ed.).
</p><p>
On the other hand, respondent ECC maintains that the disability of 
petitioner -- functional loss due to hemiparesis -- is not covered by 
Article 192 of the New Labor Code on permanent total disability.  
Respondent contends that petitioner does not suffer from total paralysis
 nor does the medical certificates of his attending physician prove that
 at the time of evaluation of his disability, petitioner was already 
suffering from mental and neurological deficit which might serve as 
basis for petitioner to qualify for permanent total disability benefits.
</p><p>
Respondent ECC further contends that its decision is not without 
substantial evidence.  Its findings were based on the reports of the 
doctors of respondent GSIS as reviewed by the Medical Officer of the 
ECC, which doctors actually conducted a physical examination on 
petitioner.  It was only after then that petitioner's disability was 
classified as permanent partial based on the schedule of disabilities 
formulated specially to provide standard for calculation of disabilities
 of injured workers patterned after various countries where application 
was successful in solving problems of industrial physicians and 
revisions and improvements made to enlarge coverage and give increased 
benefits to the injured workers.
</p><p>
Respondent ECC reiterates in its contentions that the findings of fact 
by an administrative agency is conclusive upon the courts.
</p><p>
WE find for the petitioner.
</p><p>
Petitioner's claim that he is suffering from a permanent total 
disability is not without substantial evidence.  The certificate of his 
attend­ing physician (p. 17, rec.) dated October 21, 1980 and submitted 
to respondent GSIS, reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Diagnosis:  Subdural Hematoma(R) Fronto Parietal Post Traumatic </p>
  <p>
    Prognosis:  Guarded
  </p>
  <p>
    xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>             xx                     <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx
  </p>
  <p> As date of this examination, do you believe that the patient is 
still incapacitated from engaging in any gainful occupation?  If so, how
 long in your opinion will the patient be still unable to engage in any 
gainful occupation?  -- ­<em>Total Disability.</em>"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, as per his physician's opinion, petitioner is totally incapacitated and incapable of engaging in any gainful occupation.
</p><p>
In the case of Marte vs. ECC (96, SCRA 884), the Supreme Court ruled:  
"Doctor's certification as to the nature of claimant's disability may be
 given credence as he would not normally make a false certification for 
the sake of a slowly school teacher." The findings, however, of the 
doctors and the Chief Medical Officer of respondents GSIS and ECC, 
respectively, are not binding on this Court as they are not considered 
experts.  Opinion of the medical rating officer who did not physically 
examine the claimant cannot be relied upon (Nuguid vs. WCC, 93 SCRA 
374).  Physician's report that the injury caused the workmen's temporary
 disability rebutts WCC's findings of claimant's suffering no disability
 during his employment with respondent (Abordo vs. WCC, 84 SCRA 385).
</p><p>
The attending physician of herein petitioner is Dr. Romeo Gustilo, a 
well-known neurologist.  He is a neurosurgeon and the chairman of the 
Department of Neurological Sciences at the Makati Medical Center, one of
 the biggest and the best hospitals in the country.  Dr. Gustilo is an 
expert in his chosen field of practice and his opinion as to the nature 
of petitioner's injury must be respected.  According to the earlier 
decisions of this Court, where physician's report of sickness 
established not only the causal relation between claimant's work and his
 complained sickness but also his permanent and total disability, 
petitioner's claim for permanent total disability should be granted 
(Francisco vs. WCC, 83 SCRA, 536).  The physician's report of sickness 
or accident substantiates the disability claim (Relente vs. Republic, 
106 SCRA 505; Octavio vs. WCC, 87 SCRA 416; Bandayan vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 
305; Caling vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 309; Evangelista vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 497; 
Romeo vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 482; Sudario vs. Republic, 77 SCRA 337).
</p><p>
In disability compensation, it is not the injury which is compensated, 
but rather it is the incapacity to work resulting in the impairment of 
one's earning capacity (Ulibas vs. Republic, 83 SCRA 819; Roma vs. WCC, 
80 SCRA 170).
</p><p>
Suffering from mental lapses which made him unfit for work, petitioner 
was forced to seek an early retirement on December 1, 1980 at the age of
 55 years.  From that time to the present, he has not been able to work 
nor engage in any gainful occupation.  In Marcelino vs. Seven-Up 
Bottling Co. (47 SCRA 343), petitioner was considered permanently, and 
totally disabled to work when he was incapacitated or disabled to 
perform any substantial amount of labor in the line of work where he was
 formerly engaged or any other kind of work to which he could be 
assigned.  Total disability does not mean a state of absolute 
helplessness, but disablement of an employee to earn wages in the same 
kind of work, or a work of similar nature, that he was trained for or 
accustomed to perform, or any kind of work which a person of his 
mentality and attainments could do (Landicho vs. WCC &amp; Canlubang 
Sugar Estate, 89 SCRA 147).
</p><p>
The second medical certificate issued by petitioner's attending 
physician, dated December 12, 1981, states that "he may, in the future 
develop neurological and mental deficit." Respondents now contend that 
such findings do not prove that petitioner is already suffering from 
mental and neurological deficit.  They further contend that 
peti­tioner's disability is not total and permanent because there is no 
complete paralysis nor does it fall under any of the cases enumerated 
under paragraph c, Article 192 of the Labor Code, as amended.  But 
permanent total disability, when not defined by the statute, must depend
 on the circumstances of each particular case and it has been held that 
claimant must have been rendered wholly and permanently incapable of 
work at a gainful occupation at least without endangering his health.  
An award for permanent total disability is not limited to cases in which
 claimant suffers actual loss of members of the body, although the 
statutory provision for total disability benefits specifies that loss of
 such members shall be total disability, since this is not exclusive (99
 C.J.S. Workmen's Compensation 299, pp. 1068-1-69, 1958 ed.).  Permanent
 and total disability is further defined as lack of ability to follow 
continuously some substantially gainful occupation without serious 
discomfort or pain and without material injury to health or danger to 
life (footnote no. 97, 99 C.J.S. Workmen's Compensation 299, p. 1068, 
1958 ed.).
</p><p>
The approval of claimant's application for optional retirement for 
disability although he has not yet reached the compulsory retirement 
age, is an indication of his physical incapacity to render further 
efficient service (Romero vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 482; Ybañez vs. WCC, 77 SCRA 
501).
</p><p>
Thus, it is the conclusion of this Court that the nature of petitioner's disability is one of permanent total disability.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, THE DECISION OF THE EMPLOYEES' COMPENSATION COMMISSION IS 
HEREBY MODIFIED AND THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE INSURANCE SYSTEM IS HEREBY 
ORDERED TO PAY PETITIONER THE COMPENSATION BENE­FITS AS PROVIDED FOR IN 
ARTICLE 192 OF P.D. 626, AS AMENDED, FOR PERMANENT TOTAL DISABILITY, 
EFFECTIVE AS OF FEBRUARY, 1982.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
