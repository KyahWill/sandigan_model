<blockquote>“With respect to the first ground, while admittedly the amount to be
paid Maria Luisa Madrigal Vazquez is not, strictly speaking, a claim against
the estate, nevertheless, all the heirs have agreed on August 17, 1981 that the
amount ‘shall be reimbursed by the Estate of Vicente Madrigal, or from the
proceeds of the settlement of the claim of Madrigal &amp; Co., Inc. against
said Estate.’ The Court has ordered the Administrator to pay the amount out of <span style="">the </span>assets of the estate in its
possession in compliance with the aforesaid agreement among the heirs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As regards the second ground, the records reveal that the
Administrator was furnished a copy of the motion for payment of lien on <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1982</st1:date>, which motion was set
for hearing on <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the counsel of record for the

not now complaint (sic) that it was deprived of its day in Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is merit, however, in the third ground alleged <span style="">in </span>the motion for reconsideration that
the challenged Order has not made provisions for the payment of estate
taxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court believes that part of
the approved amount should be withheld by the Administrator sufficient to
answer for the payment of taxes due thereon.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1983</st1:date>,
the probate court required the parties <span style="">to
</span>show cause why the case should not be transferred to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Regional Trial Court pursuant to the Administrative
Order issued by the Supreme Court, limiting the territorial jurisdiction of the

<p class="BODY">Two of the seven heirs, i.e., the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span>
Madrigal Vazquez and Mrs. Vazquez, manifested their desire that the case be retained
by the respondent probate court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner did not give its conformity, in effect, objecting to the
retention by the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> probate court of the case for
further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1983, petitioner filed an omnibus motion praying
for the return of the case to the court of origin, or the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Regional Trial Court, and to strike out the motion for accounting since an
accounting had already been rendered by the probate <span style="">court presided over by the now retired Judge Enrique A. <span class="SpellE">Agana</span>, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion was denied in an order dated </span><st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="3"><span style="">March 23, 1984</span></st1:date><span style=""> (Annex “E,” Petition).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals subsequently rendered the disputed decision,
upholding due process in the instant case, and waiver of venue since the lapse
from the time the case was heard at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to the present <span style="">amounted to a waiver on
the part of petitioner to raise the question of venue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards Mrs. Vazquez’ claim of
P5,833,333.33, the Court of Appeals denied the same since payment thereof
would, in effect amount to a partial distribution of the estate of the
deceased, Don Vicente Madrigal, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the intestate proceedings, which may not be allowed prior to the delivery to
any beneficiary of his/her distributive share of the estate and before the </span>payment
<span style="">of estate taxes, pursuant to Sec. 107
of the National Internal Revenue Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents’ motion for accounting was likewise denied and
directed to </span><span style="">betaken </span><span style="">up in the settlement proceedings before the
respondent court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Before Us, petitioner raises only the issue on improper venue,
insisting as a result, on the nullity of the probate proceedings including that
taken by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that the probate proceedings should properly
have been retained by the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City<span style=""> Regional Trial Court, pursuant to Rule 73,
Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“SECTION 1. Where estate of deceased persons settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-If the decedent is an inhabitant <span style="">of </span>the Philippines at the time of his
death, whether a citizen or an alien, his will shall be proved, or letters of
administration granted and his estate settled, in the Court of First Instance
in the province in which he resides at the time of his death, and if he is an
inhabitant of <span style="">a </span>foreign country,
the Court of First Instance of any province in which he had estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court first taking cognizance of the
settlement of the estate of a decedent, shall exercise jurisdiction to the
exclusion of all other, courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
jurisdiction assumed by a court, so far as it depends on the place of residence
of the decedent, or of the location of his estate, shall not be contested in a
suit or proceeding, except in an appeal from that court, in the original case,
or when the want of jurisdiction appears on the record.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that their failure to object <span style="">to </span>the proceedings conducted at <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pasay</span></span><span style=""> </span>City Regional Trial Court, should not
be taken <span style="">as a </span>waiver on their <span style="">part </span>as to venue because they believed
that the proceedings were <span style="">only
temporary and that the case would subsequently be returned to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quezon</span></span><span style=""> City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> for further proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the records of the case, however, reveal that
petitioner never objected when then Judge Enrique <span class="SpellE">Agana</span>

his detail <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>

<blockquote>“It was actually only after the Honorable Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>

jurisdiction of the Probate Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As correctly stated by petitioner, on <st1:date year="1983" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1983</st1:date>, the Probate Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>

the parties, including the private respondent, except the petitioner herein,
manifested their willingness to have the case retained by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner did not respond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> issued an Order
on <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1983</st1:date> stating

</span>Petitioner did not then move for a reconsideration of said Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its contention that ‘it did not conform

is an utter falsity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A<span style="">s a </span>matter of fact, it continued
attending all subsequent proceedings and its counsel, as earlier stated, was
even later to verbally manifest its agreement to have the case retained by the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:place></st1:city> branch.” (pp. 245-246, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

that only two <span style="">heirs agreed to the
retention by the probate court is misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent has pointed out:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“It is incorrect for petitioner to declare that the other heirs of the
late Don Vicente Madrigal never manifested their willingness to have the
probate court continue with the proceedings below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that the other heirs of Don
Vicente Madrigal <span style="">were (as </span>they
continue to be) represented by the law firm of <span class="SpellE">Bausa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ampil</span> and Suarez, and this <span style="">is </span>evident from the Motion for Extension of Time of said firm
dated May 24,1983, a copy of which is attached as Annex ‘4’ hereof, wherein
said other heirs specifically asked for an <span style="">extension </span>of fifteen days (from May 25, 1983 - and<span style=""> </span>therefore up to June 10, 1983) within
which to file their common desire to have the probate court continue with the
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the same law firm
that filed the Manifestation (Annex ‘9’<span style=""> </span>of
Comment of private respondent) dated June 10, 1983, precisely expressing the
consent of all the other heirs, as well as <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span>
Madrigal-Gonzales, that the probate court continue with the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 249-250, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appears unable to distinguish between jurisdiction and
venue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief Justice Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Fernan</span> <span style="">lays down
the distinction between the two, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Questions or issues relating to venue of actions are basically
governed by Rule 4 of the Revised Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said that the laying <span style="">of </span>venue is procedural rather than
substantive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It relates to the
jurisdiction of the court over the person rather than the subject matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provisions relating to venue establish a
relation between the plaintiff and the defendant and not between the court and
the subject matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Venue relates to
trial not to jurisdiction, touches more of the convenience of the parties
rather than the substance of the case.” (Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dacoycoy</span>

523)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The action in the present case pertains to the probate of the
intestate estate of the late Don Vicente Madrigal, in which case a regional
trial court properly has jurisdiction over the case, both under the Judiciary
Act of 1948, Sec. 44 (e) and under BP 129, Sec. 19(4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Objection to improper venue should be made in a motion to
dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until this is done, venue
cannot truly be said to have been improperly laid.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, of course note that petitioner had, in fact, filed an Omnibus
Motion to Dismiss, questioning the venue of the probate proceedings at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was howeve<span style="">r</span>, filed quite late in the day, petitioner having already
submitted his person to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, it would appear
that petitioner </span>was <span style="">motivated by
some other reasons for belatedly questioning the venue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, private respondent’s observations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Contrary to petitioner’s pretense, it never sounded off its
vigorous objection that venue was improperly laid nor against the jurisdiction
of the probate court <u><span style="">until</span></u><span style=""> </span>said court issued the order of <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after its receipt of said order,
wherein the probate court directed petitioner to <span style="">pay </span>herein private respondent the total amount of P5,833,333.33
that petitioner commenced its mindless and baseless attack against the
jurisdiction of the probate court below claiming now, that venue, which it has
for a long time waived, should be with the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Regional Trial Court.” (p. 250, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regrettably, therefore, while We agree with the petitioner that
venue in this case should have been laid in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, petitioner’s inaction
has worked against it:</p>

<blockquote>“It is well-settled in this jurisdiction that <u>wrong</u> venue <span style="">is </span>merely a <span class="SpellE">waiveable</span>
procedural defect, and <span style="">su</span>ch<span style=""> </span>waiver may occur by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.” (<span class="SpellE">Uriarte</span>

<p class="BODY">Foregoing considered, We agree with the Court of Appeals that
indeed, petitioner has waived its right to contest the question of venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">We quote from the decision of the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Noted is that as per Order of April 11, 1983 (p. 130, id.), this
case was brought to the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City by the former presiding Judge after his temporary detail with the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City branch, the former Court of First Instance, now
the Regional Trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When that
detail was terminated, it follows that the provisions of the Judiciary
Reorganization Act of 1980 or the Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 and the Resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of the Supreme
Court dated February 10, 1983 on pending cases as of February 14, 1983,
limiting the territorial jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City,
Regional Trial Court to <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City cases only is
operative already and should have been followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, in other words, Special Proceedings No.
Q-16962 (sic) should have been sent to the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City which was pointed out by the respondent court
earlier but which position was not pursued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, neither did the petitioner raise this question, to emphasize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing resolution, however is merely
directory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein <span class="SpellE">Ponente</span> had come across similar instances where cases were
brought along by an incumbent RTC Judge who is re-assigned to another place but
within the same district or province, despite the opposition from one
litigant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, it can be
again said <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>lapse</u> <u>of</u> <u>time</u> <u>from</u>
<u>the</u> <u>time</u> <u>the</u> <u>case</u> <u>was</u> <u>heard</u> <u>at</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Pasay</u></span> <u>City</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>present,</u>
<u>has</u> <u>amounted</u> <u>to</u> <u>another</u> <u>waiver</u> on the part
of the petitioner to contest the question of venue which he has been
questioning after the issuance of the questioned Orders of October <span style="">20, </span>1983 and December 8,<span style=""> </span>1983, apparently <span class="SpellE">adversed</span>
<span style="">(sic) </span>to its liking due to some
legal grounds like the non-payment of taxes which will be discussed below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At this juncture, We are not prepared to rule that all the
proceedings in the past are null and void because of venue and send back the
proceedings to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Regional Trial Court,
try the case anew from the very beginning to where this incident came about
which proceedings might take more than five (5) years again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not prone <span style="">to </span>do this, conscious of the fact that one of the primordial
objections of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
129 is the speedy administration <span style="">of </span>justice
<span style="">but </span>within the framework of the
rule <span style="">o</span>f law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not inclined to give our <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> to the petitioner’s desire for the said transfer
because the procedure will only militate against <span style="">t</span>he interest of all parties considering that everybody is
desirous to terminate the proceedings as early as possible and the continuance
of the proceedings before the respondent court has not caused any damage
against the parties and there is no damage <span style="">as </span>well against public interest.” (pp. 35-36, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>
