				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">PETITIONER assails in this petition (for declaratory relief, <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition) the following resolutions of the Commission on Elections:  Resolution No. 2327 dated 26 December 1991
for being unconstitutional, and Resolution No. 92-0829 dated 6 April 1992 and
Resolution No. 92-0999 dated 23 April 1992, for want of legal and factual
bases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual backdrop:  In
preparation for the synchronized national and local elections scheduled on 11
May 1992, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) issued on 11 December 1991
Resolution No. 2323 otherwise referred to as the "Gun Ban,” promulgating
rules and regulations on bearing, carrying and transporting of firearms or
other deadly weapons, on security personnel or bodyguards, on bearing arms by
members of security agencies or police organizations, and organization or
maintenance of reaction forces during the election period.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequently, on 26 December 1991 COMELEC issued Resolution No. 2327 providing
for the summary disqualification of candidates engaged in gunrunning, using and
transporting of firearms, organizing special strike forces, and establishing
spot checkpoints.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 January 1992, pursuant <span style="">to </span>the "Gun Ban," Mr. Serapio P. Taccad,
Sergeant-at-Arms, House of Representatives, wrote petitioner who was then
Congressman of the 1st District of Bulacan requesting the return of the two (2)
firearms<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
issued to him by the House of Representatives.  Upon being advised of the request on 13 January 1992 by his staff,
petitioner immediately instructed his driver, Ernesto Arellano, to pick up the
firearms from petitioner's house at Valle Verde and return them to Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, at about five o'clock in the afternoon of the same
day, the Philippine National Police (PNP) headed by Senior Superintendent
Danilo Cordero set up a checkpoint outside the Batasan Complex some twenty (20)
meters away from its entrance.  About
thirty minutes later, the policemen <span style="">manning
</span>the outpost flagged down the car driven by Arellano as it approached the
checkpoint.  They searched the car and
found the firearms neatly packed in their gun cases and placed in a bag in the
trunk of the car.  Arellano was then
apprehended and detained.  He explained
that he was ordered by petitioner to get the firearms from the house and return
them to Sergeant-at Arms Taccad of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the police referred Arellano's case to the Office of
the City Prosecutor for inquest.  The
referral did not include petitioner as among those charged with an election
offense.  On 15 January 1992, the City
Prosecutor ordered the release of Arellano after finding the latter's sworn
explanation meritorious.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 January 1992, the City Prosecutor invited petitioner to
shed light on the circumstances mentioned in Arellano's sworn explanation.  Petitioner not only appeared at the
preliminary investigation to confirm Arellano's statement but also wrote the
City Prosecutor urging him to exonerate Arellano.  He explained that Arellano did not violate the firearms ban as he
in fact was complying with it when apprehended by returning the firearms to
Congress; and, that he was petitioner's driver, not a security officer nor a
bodyguard.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 March 1992, the Office of the City Prosecutor issued a
resolution which, among other matters, recommended that the case against
Arellano be dismissed and that the "unofficial" charge against
petitioner be also dismissed.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, on 6 April 1992, upon recommendation of its Law
Department, COMELEC issued Resolution No. 92-0829 directing the filing of
information against petitioner and Arellano for violation of Sec. 261, par.
(q), of B.P. Blg. 881 otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code, in relation
to Sec. 32 of R.A. No. 7166;<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> and
petitioner to show cause why he should not be disqualified from running for an
elective position, pursuant to COMELEC Resolution No. 2327, in relation to
Secs. 32, 33 and 35 of R.A. 7166, and Sec. 52, par. (c), of B.P. Blg. 881.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 April 1992, petitioner moved for reconsideration and to
hold in abe<span style="">y</span>ance the
administrative proceedings as well as the filing of the information in court.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
On 23 April 1992, the COMELEC denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, this recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner questions the constitutionality of Resolution No.
2327.  He argues that the rules and
regulations of an administrative body must respect the limits defined by law;
that the Omnibus Election Code provides for the disqualification of any
person/candidate from running for or holding a public office, i.e., any person
who has either been declared by competent authority as insane or incompetent or
has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion or
for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than
eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude; that gunrunning,
using or transporting firearms or similar weapons and other acts mentioned in
the resolution are not within the letter or spirit of the provisions of the
Code; that the resolution did away with the requirement of final conviction
before the commission of certain offenses; that instead, it created a
presumption of guilt as a candidate may be disqualified from office in
situations (a) where the criminal charge is still pending, (b) where there is
no pending criminal case, and (c) where the accused has already been acquitted,
all contrary to the requisite quantum of proof for one to be disqualified from
running or holding public office under the Omnibus Election Code, i.e., proof
beyond reasonable doubt.  As a result,
petitioner concludes, Resolution No. 2327 violates the fundamental law thus
rendering it fatally defective.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, the issue on the disqualification of petitioner from running
in the 11 May 1992 synchronized elections was rendered moot when he lost his
bid for a seat in Congress in the elections that ensued.  Consequently, it is now futile to discuss
the implications of the charge against him on his qualification to run for
public office.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, there still remains an important question to be
resolved, i.e., whether he can be validly prosecuted for instructing his driver
to return to the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives the two
firearms issued to him on the basis of the evidence gathered from the
warrantless search of his car.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner strongly protests against the manner by which the PNP
conducted the search.  According to him,
without a warrant and without informing the driver of his fundamental rights
the policemen searched his car.  The
firearms were not tucked in the waist nor within the immediate reach of
Arellano but were neatly packed <span style="">in
their gun cases and wrapped in a bag kept in the trunk of the car.  Thus, the search of his car that yielded the
evidence for the prosecution was clearly violative of Secs. 2 and 3, par. (2),
Art. III, of the Constitution.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further maintains that he was neither impleaded as
party respondent in the preliminary investigation before the Office of the City
Prosecutor nor included in the charge sheet.  Consequently, making him a respondent in the criminal information would
violate his constitutional right to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner disputes the charge that he violated Sec. 33 of R.A.
7166, which prohibits any candidate for public office during the election
period from employing or availing himself or engaging the services of security
personnel or bodyguards since, admittedly, Arellano was not a security officer
or bodyguard but a civilian employee assigned to him as driver by the House of
Representatives.  Specifically, petitioner
further argues, Arellano was instructed to return to Congress, as he did, the
firearms in compliance with the directive of its Sergeant-at-Arms pursuant to
the "Gun Ban," thus, no law was in fact violated.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 25 June 1992, we required COMELEC to file its own comment on
the petition<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
upon manifestation of the Solicitor General that it could not take the position
of COMELEC and prayed instead to be excused from filing the required comment.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">COMELEC claims that petitioner is charged with violation of Sec.
261, par. (q), in relation to Sec. 263, of B.P. Blg. 881 which provides that
"the principals, accomplices and accessories, as defined in the Revised
Penal Code, shall be criminally liable for election offenses." It points
out that it was upon petitioner's instruction that Arellano brought the
firearms in question outside petitioner's residence, submitting that his right
to be heard was not violated as he was invited by the City Prosecutor to
explain the circumstances regarding Arellano's possession of the firearms.  Petitioner also filed a sworn written
explanation about the incident.  Finally, COMELEC claims that violation of the "Gun Ban" is <i><span style="">mala </span></i><i><span style="">prohibita</span></i><span style="">,<i> </i></span>hence,
the intention of the offender is immaterial.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, we find no need to delve into the alleged
constitutional infirmity of Resolution No. 2327 since this petition may be
resolved without passing upon this particular issue.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule, a valid search must be authorized by a search warrant
duly issued by an appropriate authority.  However<span style="">, </span>this is not
absolute.  Aside from a search incident
to a lawful arrest, a warrantless search had been upheld in cases of moving
vehicles and the seizure of evidence in plain view,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as the search conducted at police <span style="">or
</span>military checkpoints which we declared are not illegal <i><span style="">per</span></i><span style=""> <i>se</i>, </span>and stressed that the <u>warrantless search is not </u><u><span style="">violative of the Constitution for as long as
the vehicle is neither searched nor its </span>occupants subjected to a body
search, and the inspection of the </u><u><span style="">vehicle
is merely limited </span>to </u><u><span style="">a
visual search</span></u><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the guns were not tucked in Arellano's
waist nor placed within his reach, and that they were neatly packed in gun
cases and placed inside a bag at the back of the car.  Significantly, COMELEC did not rebut this claim.  The records do not show that the manner by
which the package was bundled led the PNP to suspect that it contained
firearms.  There was no mention either
of any report regarding any nervous, suspicious or unnatural reaction from
Arellano when the car was stopped and searched.  Given these circumstances and relying on its visual observation,
the PNP could not thoroughly search the car lawfully as well as the package
without violating the constitutional injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">An extensive search without warrant could only be resorted to if
the officers conducting the search had reasonable or probable cause to believe <u><span style="">before</span></u><span style=""> </span>the search that either the motorist was a law offender or that
they would find the instrumentality or evidence pertaining to the commission of
a crime in the vehicle to be searched.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> The
existence of probable cause justifying the warrantless search is determined by
the facts of each case.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, we upheld the validity of the warrantless search in situations where the
smell of marijuana emanated from a plastic bag owned by the accused, or where
the accused was acting suspiciously, and attempted to flee.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We also recognize the stop-and-search without warrant conducted
by police officers <span style="">o</span>n the basis
of prior confidential information which were reasonably corroborated by other
attendant matters, e.g., where a confidential report that a sizeable volume of
marijuana would be transported along the route where the search was conducted
and appellants were caught <i><span style="">in
flagrante </span></i><i><span style="">delicto </span></i>transporting
drugs at the time of their arrest;<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
where apart from the intelligence information, there were reports by an
undercover "deep penetration" agent that appellants were bringing
prohibited drugs into the country;<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
where the information that a Caucasian coming from Sagada bringing prohibited
drugs was strengthened by the conspicuous bulge in accused's waistline and his
suspicious failure to produce his passport and other identification papers;<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where the physical appearance of the

where the accused carrying a bulging black leather bag were suspiciously quiet
and nervous when queried about its contents;<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> or
where the identity of the drug courier was already established by police
authorities who received confidential information about the probable arrival of
accused on board one of the vessels arriving in Dumaguete City.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, we find that the checkpoint was set up
twenty (20) meters from the entrance to the Batasan Complex to enforce
Resolution No. 2327.  There was no
evidence to show that the policemen were impelled to do so because of a
confidential report leading them to reasonably believe that certain motorists
matching the description furnished by their informant were engaged in
gunrunning, transporting firearms or in organizing special strike forces.  <span style="">Nor,
as </span>adverted to earlier, was there any indication from the package or
behavior of Arellano that could have triggered the suspicion of the policemen.  Absent such justifying circumstances
specifically pointing to the culpability of petitioner and Arellano, the search
could not be valid.  The action then of
the policemen unreasonably intruded into petitioner's privacy and the security
of his property, in violation of Sec. 2, Art. III, of the Constitution.  Consequently, the firearms obtained in
violation of petitioner's right against warrantless search cannot be admitted
for any purpose in any proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be argued that the seeming acquiescence of Arellano to the
search constitutes an implied waiver of petitioner's right to question the
reasonableness of the search of the vehicle and the seizure of the firearms.</p>

<p class="BODY">While Resolution No. 2327 authorized the setting up of
checkpoints, it however stressed that "guidelines shall be made to ensure
that no infringement of civil and political rights results from the
implementation of this authority," and that "the places and manner of
setting up of checkpoints shall be determined in consultation with the
Committee on Firearms Ban and Security Personnel created under Sec. 5,
Resolution No. 2323."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a> The
facts show that PNP installed the checkpoint at about five o'clock in the
afternoon of 13 January 1992.  The
search was made soon thereafter, or thirty minutes later.  It was not shown that news of impending
checkpoints without necessarily giving their locations, and the reason for the
same have been announced in the media to forewarn the citizens.  Nor did the informal checkpoint that
afternoon carry signs informing the public of the purpose of its
operation.  As a result, motorists
passing that place did not have any inkling whatsoever about the reason behind
the instant exercise.  With the
authorities in control to stop and search passing vehicles, the motorists did
not have any choice but to submit to the PNP's scrutiny.  Otherwise, any attempt to turnabout albeit
innocent would raise suspicion and provide probable cause for the police to
arrest the motorist and to conduct an extensive search of his vehicle.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of petitioner, only his driver was at the car at that
time it was stopped for inspection.  As
conceded by COMELEC, driver Arellano did not know the purpose of the
checkpoint.  In the face of fourteen
(14) armed policemen conducting the operation,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
driver Arellano being alone and <span style="">a </span>mere
employee <span style="">of </span>petitioner could not
have marshalled the strength and the courage to protest against the extensive
search conducted in the vehicle.  In
such scenario, the "implied acquiescence," if there was any, could
not be more than a mere passive conformity on Arellano's part to the search,
and "consent" given under intimidating or coercive circumstances is
no consent within the purview of the constitutional guaranty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the manner by which COMELEC proceeded against
petitioner runs counter to the due process clause of the Constitution.  The facts show that petitioner was not among
those charged by the PNP with violation of the Omnibus Election Code.  Nor was he subjected by the City Prosecutor
to a preliminary investigation for such offense.  The non-disclosure by the City Prosecutor to the petitioner that
he was a respondent in the preliminary investigation is violative of due
process which requires that the procedure established by law should be obeyed.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">COMELEC argues that petitioner was given the chance to be heard
because he was invited to enlighten the City Prosecutor regarding the
circumstances leading to the arrest of his driver, and that petitioner in fact
submitted a sworn letter of explanation regarding the incident.  This does not satisfy the requirement of due
process the essence of which is the reasonable opportunity to be heard and to
submit any evidence one <span style="">may have in
support of his defense.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Due process guarantees the observance of

<blockquote>While the right to preliminary investigation is statutory rather than
constitutional in its fundament, since it has in fact been established by
statute, <u>it is a component part of due process in criminal justice</u>.  The right to have a preliminary
investigation conducted before being bound over to trial for a criminal offense
and hence formally at risk of incarceration or some other penalty is not a mere
formal or technical right; it is a <u>substantive right</u> x <span style="">x x x </span>[T]he right to an opportunity to
avoid a process painful to anyone save, perhaps, to hardened criminals is a valuable
right.  To deny petitioner's claim to a
preliminary investigation would be to deprive him of the full measure of his
right to due process.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, petitioner was merely invited during the preliminary
investigation of Arellano to corroborate the latter's explanation.  Petitioner then was made to believe that he
was not a party respondent in the case, so that his written explanation on the
incident was only intended to exculpate <span style="">Arellano,
not petitioner himself.  Hence, it
cannot be seriously contended that petitioner was fully </span>given the
opportunity to meet the accusation against him as he was not apprised that he
was himself <span style="">a </span>respondent when he
appeared before the City Prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it must be pointed out too that petitioner's filing of a
motion for reconsideration with <span style="">COMELEC </span>cannot
be considered as a waiver of his claim to a separate preliminary investigation
for himself.  The motion itself
expresses petitioner's vigorous insistence on his right.  Petitioner's protestation started as soon as
he learned of his inclusion in the charge, and did not ease up even after <span style="">COMELEC's </span>denial of his motion for
reconsideration.  This is understandably
so since the prohibition against carrying firearms bears the penalty of
imprisonment of not less than one (1) year nor more than six (6) years without
probation and with disqualification from holding public office, and deprivation
of the right to suffrage.  Against such
strong stance, petitioner clearly did not waive his right to a preliminary
investigation.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i>J.</i>:<i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur, and reiterate my objections to checkpoints in general
as originally expressed in my dissent in the case of Valmonte v. De Villa, 178
SCRA 217, where I said:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">The sweeping statements in
the majority opinion are as dangerous as </span>the checkpoints it would
sustain and fraught with serious threats <span style="">to
</span>individual liberty.  The bland
declaration that individual rights must yield to the demands of national
security ignores the fact that the Bill of Rights was intended precisely to
limit the authority of the State even if asserted on the ground of national
security.  What is worse is that the
searches and seizures are peremptorily pronounced to be reasonable even without
proof of probable cause and much less the required warrant.  The improbable excuse is that they are aimed
at "establishing an effective territorial defense, maintaining peace and
order, and providing an atmosphere conducive <span style="">to </span>the social, economic and political development of the
National Capital Region." For these purposes, every individual may be
stopped and searched at random and at any time simply because he excites the
suspicion, caprice, hostility or malice of the officers manning the
checkpoints, on pain of arrest or worse, even being shot to death, if he
resists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>Unless we are vigilant of our rights, we may find ourselves back to
the dark era of the truncheon and the barbed wire, with the Court itself a
captive of its own complaisance and sitting at the death-bed of liberty.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I hope the colleagues I have behind on my retirement will
reconsider the stand of the Court on checkpoints and finally dismantle them
altogether as an affront to individual liberty.</p>

<div class="Section1">

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I regret that I can concur only in the result, <i><span style="">viz., </span></i>the granting of the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the specific issues raised by the petitioner which,
as stated in the <i>exordium </i>of the majority opinion, are whether (a) <span style="">COMELEC </span>Resolution No. 2327, dated 26
December 1991, is unconstitutional, and (b) <span style="">COMELEC </span>Resolutions No. 92-0829, dated 6 April 1992, and No.
92-0999, dated 23 April 1992, have legal and factual bases, I am unable to
agree with the specific disposition declaring (a) illegal the warrantless
search conducted by the Philippine National Police (PNP) on 13 January 1992,
(b) inadmissible in evidence in any proceeding against the petitioner the
firearms seized during such warrantless search, and (c) unconstitutional <span style="">COMELEC </span>Resolution No. 92-0829.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Having declined to rule on the constitutionality of Resolution
No. 2327 because "this petition may be resolved without passing upon this
particular issue" <span style="">(first paragraph,
page 10, </span><i>Ponencia), </i>this Court may no longer inquire into the
constitutionality of the spot checkpoints authorized to be established
thereunder.  And whether the warrantless
search conducted by the PNP at the checkpoint was valid, it being assumed that
it would have been, provided there existed a probable cause therefor, is a
question of fact whose presentation in this case is either procedurally
premature, or one which this Court cannot, with definiteness, resolve
considering the obvious paucity of the facts before it.  The most the majority opinion can state is
that "[t]here was no evidence to show that the police were impelled to do
so because of a confidential report leading them to reasonably believe that
certain motorists matching the description furnished by their informant were
engaged in <span style="">gunrunning, </span>transporting
firearms or in organizing special strike forces.  Nor, as adverted to earlier, was there any indication from the
package or behavior of Arellano that could have triggered the suspicion of the
policemen." Nothing more could be expected at this stage since the records
of the proceedings conducted by the Office of the City Prosecutor and the
COMELEC are not before this Court.  A
declaration of invalidity of the warrantless search and of the inadmissibility
in evidence of the firearms seized would thus be premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may additionally be relevant to state that the search was not
in connection with the crime of illegal possession of firearms, which would
have been factually and legally baseless since the firearms involved were
licensed and were duly issued to the petitioner by the House of
Representatives, but for the violation of the gun ban which was validly decreed
by the COMELEC pursuant to its constitutional power to enforce and administer
all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of elections, plebiscite,
initiative, referendum, and recall (Section <span style="">2(1), </span>Article IX-C, 1987 Constitution), its statutory authority
to have exclusive charge of the enforcement and administration of all laws
relative to the conduct of elections for the purpose of ensuring free, orderly,
and honest elections (Section 52, <span style="">Omnibus
Election Code), </span>and its statutory authority to promulgate rules and
regulations implementing the provisions of the Omnibus Election Code or other
laws which the COMELEC is required to enforce and administer <span style="">(Section 52(c), Id.; Section 35, R.A. No.
7166), </span>in relation to paragraph (q), Section 261 of the Omnibus Election
Code which prohibits the carrying of firearms outside the residence or place of
business during the election period unless authorized in writing by the
COMELEC, and Section 32 of R.A. No. 7166 which prohibits any person from
bearing, carrying, or transporting firearms or other deadly weapons in public
places, including any building, street, park, private vehicle, or public
conveyance, even if such person is licensed to possess or carry the same during
the election period, unless authorized in writing by the COMELEC.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the petitioner himself admits that on 10 January 1992
he was requested by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives to
return the two firearms issued to him, and that on 13 January 199<span style="">2</span>, he instructed his driver, Ernesto
Arellano, to pick up the firearms from his (petitioner's) house at Valle Verde
and to return them to the House of Representatives.  That day was already within the election period, which commenced
the day earlier pursuant to COMELEC Resolution No. 2314 (In The Matter of
Fixing The Schedule of Activities in Connection With the Elections of National
and Local Officials on <span style="">May </span>11, <span style="">1992), </span>promulgated on 20 November
1991.  Considering then that the offense
for which he was to be charged was for the violation <span style="">of paragraph (q), Section 261 of the Omnibus Election Code, in relation
to Section 32 of R.A. No. 7166, which, in view of his aforesaid admissions,
renders unnecessary the offer in evidence of the seized firearms, I fail to
grasp the rationale of a ruling on the admissibility in evidence of the
firearms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. COMELEC Resolution No. 92-0829, dated 6 April 1992, should not
be set aside on the ground of unconstitutionality.  It simply directed the filing of an information against the
petitioner and Arellano for the violation of paragraph (q), Section 261 of the
Omnibus Election Code, in relation to Section 32 of R.A. No. 7166, and directed
the petitioner to show cause why he should not be disqualified from running for
an elective position, pursuant to COMELEC Resolution No. 2327, in relation to
Sections 32, 33, and 35 of R.A. No. 7166 and paragraph (c), Section 52 of the
Omnibus Election Code.  Insofar as
Arellano is concerned, he is not a petitioner in this case.  Moreover, as to him, the resolution was
nothing more than a disapproval of the recommendation of the Office of the City
Prosecutor to dismiss the complaint against him.  As against the petitioner, there was no denial of due process
because the petitioner was later heard on his motion for reconsideration.  Moreover, the right of an accused to a
preliminary <span style="">investigation </span>is not
a creation of the Constitution; its origin is statutory <i><span style="">(Kilusang Bayan sa Paglilingkod </span>ng mga
Magtitinda ng Bagong Pamilihang Bayan ng Muntinglupa, Inc. vs. Dominguez, </i>205
SCRA 92 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The fatal flaw of Resolution No. 92-0829 lies in its directive to
file the information against the petitioner despite the fact that he was never
formally charged before the Office of the City Prosecutor.  There was only an "'unofficial' charge
imputed against" him.  The COMELEC
then acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to want or excess of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>I vote</b> then <b>to grant </b>the <b>petition,</b> but <b>solely</b>
on the <b>ground</b> that the <b>COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion</b>
in <b>directing</b> the <b>filing of an information against the petitioner</b>
for the <b>violation of paragraph (q), Section 261 of the Omnibus Election
Code, in relation to Section 32 of R.A. No. 7166.</b></p>

<div class="Section1">

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="">CONCURRING </span>AND
DISSENTING OPINION<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">REGALADO, <i>J.</i>:<i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">I join Mr. Justice Davide, Jr. in his opinion wherein he concurs
with the majority ruling that with respect to petitioner Aniag, Resolution No.
92-0829 of respondent commission should be set aside, not because of an
unconstitutional warrantless search but by reason of the fact that he was not
actually charged as a respondent in the preliminary investigation of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to petitioner's driver, Ernesto Arellano, although he
was not impleaded as a co-petitioner in the present recourse, the nullification
of said Resolution No. 92-0829 necessarily applies to him and redounds to his
benefit.  To the extent, therefore, that
the majority opinion thereby reinstates the resolution of the Office <span style="">of </span>the City Prosecutor dismissing the
charge against Arellano, I concur in that result.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, even as a simple matter of consistency but more in point
of law, I dissent from the rationale submitted therefor, that <span style="">is, </span>that Arellano was the victim of an
unlawful search without a warrant.  The
pertinent facts stated by the majority readily yield the conclusion that there
was consent on the part of Arellano to the search of the car then under his
control, particularly of its baggage compartment where the firearms were
discovered.  As held in <i>People vs.
Excela, et al.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
consent to a search may be given expressly or impliedly, and as early as <i><span style="">People vs. </span>Malasugui,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the settled rule is that a search may be validly conducted without a warrant if
the person searched consented thereto.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I would prefer to sustain the exoneration of Ernesto Arellano on
the justifying circumstance that he was acting in obedience to what he
innocently believed to be a lawful order of a superior, that is, the
instructions of his employer, petitioner Aniag, who was himself acting upon and
in compliance with Resolution No. 2323 of respondent commission which was
implemented by the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said justifying circumstance provided in paragraph 6, Article
11 of the Revised Penal Code can be given suppletory effect to special laws
like B.P. Blg. 881 and R.A. No. 7166 by force of Article 10 of the same
Code.  There is no <i>prohibition </i>therefor
in the cited provisions of B.P. Blg. 881 in relation to R.A. No. 7166, nor is
there any <i>legal impossibility </i>for such suppletory application whether by
express provision or by necessary implication.  And even if the order of petitioner Aniag may be considered as illegal,
Arellano acted thereon in good faith<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> and
under a mistake of fact as to its legality, hence his exculpation is ineludibly
dictated.  <i>Ignorantia facti excusat.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It being evident from the very records and the factual findings
adopted in the majority opinion that no error was committed by the Office of
the City Prosecutor in dismissing the charge against Ernesto Arellano for lack
of sufficient <span style="">grounds </span>to
engender a well founded belief that a crime had been committed and that he was
probably guilty thereof,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent commission acted with grave abuse of discretion in arriving at <span style="">a </span>contrary conclusion and directing
his prosecution in its Resolution No. 92-0829.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">VITUG, <i><span style="">J.</span></i><span style="">:</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The ultimate hypothesis of sound governance is not might but the
willingness of the governed to accept and subordinate themselves to authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">When our people gave their consent to the fundamental law of the
land, they did not renounce but, to the contrary, reserved for themselves
certain rights that they held sacred and inviolable.</p>

<p class="BODY">One such right is the privilege to be so secured "in their
persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
of whatever nature and for any purpose." Their sole conceded <u>proviso</u>
to this rule is when a search warrant or a warrant of arrest is lawfully
issued.  There are, to be sure, known
exceptions, predicated on necessity and justified by good reasons, when warrantless
searches and seizures are allowed.  It
is in this context that I appreciate the <u>ratio</u> <u>decidendi</u> of the
Court in Valmonte vs. De Villa (178 SCRA 211).  In giving its imprimatur to the installation of checkpoints, the Court
clearly has based its decision on the existence <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>time</u>
of what has been so described as an "abnormal" situation that then
prevailed.  Evidently, the Court did not
have the intention to have its ruling continue to apply to less aberrant
circumstances than previously obtaining.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question has been asked:  Between the security of the State and its due preservation, on the one
hand, and the constitutionally-guaranteed right of an individual, on the other
hand, which should be held to prevail?  There is no choice to my mind not for any other reason than because
there is, in the first place, utterly no need to make a choice.  The two are not incompatible; neither are
they necessarily opposed to each other.  Both can be preserved; indeed, the vitality of one is the strength of the
other.</p>

<p class="BODY">There should be ways to curb the ills of society so severe as
they might seem.  A disregard of
constitutional mandates or an abuse on the citizenry, I am most certain, is not
the answer.  It might pay to listen to
the words of Mr. Justice Isagani A. Cruz when he said, "(u)nless we are
vigilant of our rights, we may find ourselves back to the dark era of the
truncheon and the barbed wire, with the Court itself a captive of its own
complaisance and sitting at the death-bed of liberty."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a welcome note that in the subsequent case of Bagalihog vs.
Fernandez (198 SCRA 614), the Court has expressed:</p>

<blockquote>"This guaranty is one of the greatest of individual liberties
and was already recognized even during the days of the absolute monarchies,
when the king could do no wrong.  On
this right, Cooley wrote:  "Awe
surrounded and majesty clothed the King, but the humblest subject might shut
the door of his cottage against him and defend from intrusion that privacy
which was as sacred as the kingly prerogatives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The provision protects not only those who appear to be
innocent but also whose who appear to be guilty but are nevertheless to be
presumed innocent until the contrary is proved.  The mere fact that in the private respondent's view the crime
involved is ‘heinous’ and the victim was ‘a man of consequence’ did not
authorize disregard of the constitutional guaranty.  Neither did 'superior orders' condone the omission for they could
not in any case be superior to the Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While it gives me great comfort to concur with my esteemed
colleague, Mr. Justice Josue N. Bellosillo, in his <u>ponencia</u>, I would
express, nonetheless, the humble view that even on the above constitutional
aspect, the petition could rightly be granted.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
