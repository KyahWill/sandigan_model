<p class="BODY">In seeking the reversal of the trial court, appellant questions
the credibility of complainant raising several arguments viz:  1) If it were true that accused was already

complainant, he could not have known that the latter will be going out, unless
there was a previous understanding between them; 2) If complainant was really
raped at the main door as testi­fied to by her, the fact that she did not seek
the help of the male employees sleeping inside the pubhouse near the main door,
who could have been easily awakened by her cries and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

11.0pt">doubts </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">on her claim
against accused; 3) It is impossible for accused to satisfy his lust on the
complainant within </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">short a time (four to five minutes)
especially with his maong pants on although zipped </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">open in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

folk house restaurant at about 4:00 on April 15, 1984 where appellant sexually
assaulted her.  Nancy was deter­mined to
file a complaint for rape against appellant.  She consented.  On the same date
(April <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">18, 1984), they reported the
incident to the </span>COMDISCOM <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in
Cotabato City.  Appellant was arrested
by Sgt. Alberto Amora while singing at the folkhouse.  He was taken to the PC, headquarters for investigation.  Found in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Briefly it is appellant's contention that the sexual intercourse
between himself and Nancy Tejas in the early morning of April 15, 1984 was
mutually and voluntarily agreed upon by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">them
since </span>they are sweethearts and that no force was employed to intimidate
the latter to perform the act <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">him.  Appellant contends further that what prodded complainant to file the
rape complaint was her belief that one of the male employees woke up and noticed
what they were doing although the accused believed otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contentions hold no water.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputable findings of facts made by the lower <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court </span>reveal that the claim of
appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that Nancy Tejas </span>was
his sweetheart is without basis and is not proven by evidence.  The lower court found thus:</p>

<blockquote>"First, according to the accused Antonio Pena, he courted
Nancy Tejas in February and was accepted as her sweetheart.  But could they be sweethearts in so short a
period of time when Nancy Tejas was a nursing student <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">at the Notre </span>Dame University and he was studying at the Notre
Dame Village High School during <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">day</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">time,
and the distance between the two schools are greatly faraway from each
other.  Or even granting that Nancy
Tejas was going to Ellen's Folk House in the afternoons, so that they could
possibly converse with each other, but accused Antonio Pena starts singing at
5:30 every afternoon in the month of Feb­ruary until 11:30 o'clock in the
evenings.  And in that month, accused
was not sleep­ing in the evenings at Ellen's Folk House.  Certainly, there was not so much a time for
two persons to become lovers when they rarely meet within a certain period.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"More so, Nancy Tejas was in the month of February, 1984 the
current sweetheart of Romeo Angeles, a fact known to the accused Antonio
Pena.  Unless complain­ing witness Nancy
Tejas is woman of sexual aberrations, probably to have two sweet­hearts at the
same time and have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">sex </span>with both of them would be justified.  The evidence however show otherwise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But Nancy Tejas as shown by evidence is a second year nursing
student when she was raped; she was a third honor student, and a student of a
prestigious local univer­sity.  And if
she was at Ellen's Folk House she was to assist only her mother during her off-classes
hours.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again could the complaining witness Nancy Tejas and accused
Antonio Pena in the month of March, 1984 be sweethearts and succeeded in having
sexual intercourse for several times?  The Court cannot give so much weight in such testimony.  First, we find under ordinary course of
events that accused Antonio Pena could not have been sweethearts with Nancy
Tejas in Feb­ruary, 1984 as shown above.  Added to this is the fact that Nancy Tejas in the month of March was
still studying and testified that it is only during her free time when she has
no duty at the hospital that she will assist her mother.  The Court there­fore <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">gives </span>credence to the testimony that
she came to know the accused only on March 30, 1984, after the closing of
schools for summer vacation.  This fact
was not disputed by the counsel for the accused during his cross-examination of
Nancy Tejas.  She have known the accused
for almost 15 days only.  Nowhere in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>testimony of the accused Pena did
he cite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">specific </span>dates that they
were together between February <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and
March, 1984.  All accused could say is
that they meet at the Ellen's Folk House on </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">certain period.  This is so
because there was really no time for them to meet for so long </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">time because of their studies.  Certainly, they could not ‘intimate
relations between April 1 to April 15, 1984, much more sexual relations with­in
such a period’ time.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused Antonio Pena claimed that they have sexual
intercourse for the first time on March 28, 1984 at 2:00 o'clock in the
morning.  March 28, 1984 is a Thursday,
still a school day and Nancy Tejas testified that she had still ''classes at
the NDU during the previous days prior to March 30, 1984'' (p. 3, T.S.N.
rebuttal testimony of Nancy Tejas).  And
this was towards the end of the school year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again accused Pena testified that he had sex with Nancy Tejas
on March 28, 1984 for several times.  Yet when asked by the Fiscal how many times whether 5, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">10 or 15 times, he said he could not remem­ber.  And to think that this was his first time to
have sexual intercourse with Nancy Tejas, he could not now remember how many
times did he have sex with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">her.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Again,
against human reason, accused now conve­niently forgets the number of sexual
acts, when such an event could rarely escape a man's mind it being a bestial
instinct in every human being.  And if
it is true that he had several sexual intercourse with Nancy Tejas that night,
certainly other people sleeping at Ellen's Folk House could have known it
unless they were only the two left that night which the evidence did not show.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But a reversal of his testimony was again made.  He testified that he had sex with Nancy
Tejas at 2:00 o'clock in the morning of March 28, and another at 4:00 o'clock
same morning, and confirmed later that they have sex only twice and not several
times.  He even testified that he had
sex with Nancy Tejas several days after but could no longer remember the dates,
but he can vividly remember two days when they had such an intercourse - March
28 and April 15, 1984 (pp. 11 to 16 T.S.N., testimony of Antonio Pena taken
Nov. 4, 1984).  One need not to have
great knowledge of psychology, to conclude that the statements of accused
Antonio Pena was a litany of lies.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"Again, accused
Antonio Pena testified </span>and vividly described that it was Nancy Tejas who
proposed sex with <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">on March 28, </span>1984.  Accordingly, she asked that they keep the
matter secret because her sweet­heart might know it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Reason dictates a Filipino woman would not propose sex especially
it is the first time they will have the act.  It is the man that proposes and asserts until the woman gives to this
desire.  Human exper­ience will dictate
that even men have to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">propose sex with
prostitutes with a pay.  We find no
derogatory character in the person of Nancy Tejas, nor evidence that she is a
woman of ill-refute.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Again, accused Antonio Pena testified that on his first sex with
Nancy Tejas on March 28, 1984, that Nancy Tejas was not wearing any panty or
underwear.  Is this normal for a woman
to be not wearing any underwear during her first sex with a particular
man.  Unthinkable, but Antonio insist on
it.  Definitely, this is a lie.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimonies of Ernesto Balan and Maria Teresita Pena,
mother of accused is bereft of proof.  There was not in their testimony showing positively the relationship of
sweethearts between Antonio Pena and Nancy Tejas.  All were speculative, hear<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">say
and not based on a solid existence of facts to show such relationship. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">  (pp. </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">35-37; Rollo)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court ruled that the testimony of the accused suffers
from lack of credibility.  Evidence to
be worthy of credit, must not only proceed from a reliable source, but it must
in addition, be credible itself.  Stated
otherwise, it must be natural, reasonable and probable as to make it easy to
believe.  In trying to prove his alleged
relation<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ship with complainant,
appellant presented contradictory testimonies that betrayed his cause.  Additionally, the trial court found that the
testimony of accused is one of an instructed witness, it being admitted by the
accused that he was instructed by his lawyer on what to say in the
cross-examination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Undoubtedly, Nancy Tejas
was an unwilling victim.  </span>She was
intimidated by fear to submit to the lustful desires of the appellant with the
sharp weapon pointed at her neck.  Accused-appellant
knew beforehand that Nancy Tejas would be sleeping inside the pubhouse.  He was aware of her habits in the morning
and he saw the chance he had been waiting for.  He purposely gave drinks to the other male employees who were sleeping
inside the pubhouse.  He made sure that
they were all sound asleep and too dead drunk at that time of the night or
early morning even to notice what was happening.  He wait<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ed for Nancy that
fateful morning to ravish her as an effect­ive way to inflict humiliation and
degradation on her person because of the shabby treatment he imagined to have
received from her.  Appellant admitted
that the complainant did not like him and that she was engaged to be married to
someone else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nancy Tejas was only 18 years of age at the time the incident
happened, a third year nursing student at a reput­able university and a
consistent honor student, engaged to be married to Romeo Angeles.  There is no evidence to show that she is a
woman of ill-repute or of a flirtatious and wanton nature as to invite or
provoke appellant, a mere em­ployee in her mother's pubhouse, to have sexual
intercourse with her.  Young, innocent
and decent as she is, she was cowed by fear and shock because of the outrageous
act of appellant on her person and honor.  Consent obtained by fear of personal violence is no consent at all.  Though a man <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">puts no hand on a woman, yet if, by the use of mental and moral
coercion the accused so overpowers her mind out of fear that as a result she
dare not resist the dastardly act in­flicted on her person, accus</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">e</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">d
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">i</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">s guilty of the crime imputed on him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The incident so devastated and debilitated Nancy Tejas that she
had to seek her fiancee to relate the heinous act inflicted on her by the appellant,
knowing that she could trust her boyfriend, in the absence of her mother who
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">then in another town.  If ever it took her three (3) days from
April 15, 1984, to formally complain with the proper authorities, it was
because of the fear of embarr</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ssment.  But she </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">risked </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">it all to seek justice for the affront and
insult committed upon her person by the accused-appellant, transmitting to her </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">venereal disease in the process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The guilt of appellant cannot be rebutted by his claim that he
did not leave his place of employment, even after the alleged commission of
rape.  Appellant was confident that
Nancy Tejas being an educated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">woman of </span>good
reputation would not denounce him without risk of her being humiliated
publicly.  He thought she would not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">have the courage </span>to expose him.  How <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">wrong
he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
