parties appealed, its execution has taken all of the past seventeen (17) years
with the end nowhere in sight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The delay

not the least of which is the intransigence of the defeated party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, worn down by this <span class="SpellE">attrital</span>
suit, both have pleaded for a decision to end this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assailed in this petition for review are:</p>

failed to pay the second and third installments on time, the total price of the
sale was later increased to P971,371.70 payable on or before <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The difference of P71,371.70 represented

<p class="BODY">As of <st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1968</st1:date>,

paid-up shares) in <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> Development Corporation
to <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span>, as well as the possession of the Hacienda
San Jose, the only asset of the corporation (p. 100, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as provided in paragraph 3,
subparagraph (c) of the contract to sell, <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span>
pledged 1,500 shares in favor of <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> as security
for the balance of his obligation (p. 100, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> failed to

formally informed <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> that he was rescinding the

Corporation (CFI Decision, pp. 81-100, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="2Q"><i>'It will be noted that both parties having decided not to appeal,
the decision has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, <u>the Court finds merit in the
contention of the plaintiff that the payment to the defendant of the total sum
of P410,000.00 plus the interest, should be held in abeyance pending rendition
of the accounting by the defendant of the fruits received by him on account of
the 3,100 shares of the capital stock of <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>
Development Corporation</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same
may be said with respect to the sums due the plaintiff from the defendant for
damages and attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed it
is reasonable to suppose, as contended by the plaintiff, that when such
accounting is made and the accounting, as urged by plaintiff, should refer not
only to the dividends due from the shares of</i> <i>stock but to the products
of the hacienda which is the only asset of the <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>
Development Corporation, certain sums may be found due to the plaintiff from
the defendant which may partially or entirely off set (sic) the amount adjudged
against him in the decision.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="2Q"><i>'It is the sense of the court that the <u>fruits referred to in
the decision include not only the dividends received, if any, on the 3,100
shares of stocks but more particularly the products received by the defendant
from the hacienda</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hacienda and
the products thereon produced constitute the physical assets of the <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> Development Corpora­tion represented by the shares
of stock and it would be absurd to suppose that any accounting could be made by
the defendant without necessarily taking into account the</i> <i>products
received which could be the only basis for determining whether dividends are
due or not on account of the investment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The hacienda and its natural fruits as represented by the shares of
stock which the defendant received as manager and controlling stockholder of the
<span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> Development Corporation can not be divorced
from the certificates of stock in order to determine</i> <i>whether the
defendant has correctly reported the income of the corporation or concealed
part of it for his personal advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is hardly necessary for the Court to restate an obvious fact that on
both legal and equitable grounds, the <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>
Development Corporation and defendant Jose <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span>
are one and the same persons as far as the obligation to account for the
products of the hacienda is concerned,' (pp. 4-6, Annex 1, Answer.)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote><i>"In the same Order, the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>
appointed a receiver upon the filing of a bond in the amount of
P100,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reasons of the lower
court for appointing a receiver were that the matter of accounting of the fruits
received by defendant <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> as directed in the
decision will take time; that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> has
shown sufficient and justifiable ground for the appointment of a receiver ‘in
order to preserve the Hacienda which has obviously been mismanaged by the
defendant to a point where the amortization of the loan with the Development
Bank of the Philippines has been neglected and the arrears in payments have
risen to the amount of P503,510.70 as of October 19, 1972, and there is danger
that the Development Bank of the Philippines may institute foreclosure
proceedings to the damage and prejudice of the plaintiff.' (p. 7, Id.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I. The decision of the Court of Appeals requiring the petitioner
to pay the private respondents the sum of P410,000 <u>plus interest</u>,
without first awaiting <span class="SpellE">Reynoso's</span> accounting of the
fruits of the Hacienda San Jose, violates the law of the case and Article 1385
of the Civil Code, alters the final order dated February 12, 1975 of the trial
court, and is <span class="SpellE">inequitous</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">II. The Court of Appeals erroneously applied the Corporation Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">III. The Court of Appeals erred in ordering entry of its
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We address first the third assignment of error for it will he
futile to discuss the first and second if, after all, the decision complained
of is already final, and the entry of judgment which the Court of Appeals
directed to be made in its resolution of August 24, 1977 (p. 316, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) was proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After examining the records, we find that the Court of Appeals’ decision
is not yet final.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The entry of judgment
was improvident for the Court of Appeals; in its resolution of <st1:date year="1976" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1976</st1:date>, suspended the
proceedings before it "pending the parties’ settlement negotiations"
as prayed for in their joint motion (p. 313, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without however giving them an ultimatum or
setting a deadline for the submission of their compromise agreement, the Court
of Appeals, out of the blue, issued a resolution on <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1977</st1:date> ordering the Judgment Section of
that Court to enter final judgment in the case (p. 316, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the directive was precipitate and premature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> received
the order on <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1977</st1:date>
and filed on <st1:date year="1977" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1977</st1:date>
(p. 317, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) a motion for reconsideration which
the Court of Appeals denied on <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="10">October
 4, 1977</st1:date> (p. 322, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order of denial was received on <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1977</st1:date> (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1977</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> filed in this Court a timely motion for extension
of time to file a petition for review, and the petition was filed within the
extension granted by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now address the petitioners' first and second assignments of
error.</p>

<p class="BODY">After deliberating on the petition for review, we find no reversible
error in the Court of Appeals’ decision directing the clerk of court of the
trial court to execute a deed of conveyance to <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>
of the 1,600 shares of stock of the <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>
Development Corporation still in <span class="SpellE">Reynoso's</span> name
and/or possession, in accordance with the procedure in Section 10, Rule 39 of
the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither did it err
in annulling the trial court's order:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) allowing <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> to vote the 3,100 shares
of <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> Development Corporation without having
effected the transfer of those shares in his name in the corporate books; and
(2) authorizing <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> to call a special meeting of
the stockholders of the <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> Development
Corporation and to vote the 3,100 shares, without the pre-requisite
registration of the shares in his name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a fundamental rule in Corporation Law (Section 35) that a
stockholder acquires voting rights only when the shares of stock to be voted
are registered in his name in the corporate books.</p>

<blockquote><i>"Until<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>registration is
accomplished, the transfer, though valid between the parties, cannot be
effective as against the corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the unrecorded transferee cannot enjoy the status of a
stockholder; he cannot vote nor be voted for, and he will not be entitled to dividends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Corporation will be protected when it
pays dividend to the registered owner despite a previous transfer of which it
had no knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of
registration therefore is two-fold:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to
enable the transferee to exercise all the rights of a stockholder, and to
inform the corporation of any change in share ownership so that it can
ascertain the persons entitled to the rights and subject to the liabilities of
a stockholder." (Corporation Code, Comments, Notes and Selected cases by
Campos &amp; Lopez-Campos, p. 838, 1981 Edition.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order of respondent Court directing <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>
to return the sum of P410,000 (or net P348,000 after deducting P62,000 due from
<span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> under the decision) as the price paid by <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> for the shares of stock, with legal rate of
interest, and the return by <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> of <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga's</span> 3,100 shares with the fruits (construed to mean
not only dividends but also fruits of the corporation's Hacienda San Jose) is
in full accord with Art. 1385 of the Civil Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote><i>"ART. 1385.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>
Rescission creates the obligation to return the things which were the object of
the contract, together with their fruits, and the price with its interest;
consequently, it can be carried out only when he who demands rescission can
return whatever he may be obliged to restore.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Neither shall rescission take place when the things which
are the object of the contract are legally in the possession of third persons
who did not act in bad faith.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"In this case,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>indemnity
for damages may be demanded from the person causing the loss."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Hacienda San Jose and 1,500 shares of stock have already been
returned to <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, upon the conveyance to him of the remaining 1,600 shares, <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> (or his heirs) should return to <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> the price of P410,000 which the latter paid for
those shares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the rescission
decreed in the final judgment, there should be simultaneous mutual restitution
of the principal object of the contract to sell (3,100 shares) and of the
consideration paid (P410,000).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
should not await the mutual restitution of the <u>fruits</u>, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the legal interest earned by <span class="SpellE">Reynoso's</span> P410,000 while in the possession of <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>, and its counterpart:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the fruits of Hacienda San Jose which <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> received from the time the hacienda was delivered
to him on November 4, 1968 until it was placed under receivership by the court
on March 3, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, since <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> has not yet given an accounting of those fruits, it
is only fair that <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga's</span> obligation to deliver to
<span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> the legal interest earned by his money,
should await the rendition and approval of his accounting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To this extent, the decision of the Court of
Appeals should be modified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For it would
be inequitable and oppressive to require <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> to
pay the legal interest earned by <span class="SpellE">Reynoso's</span> P410,000
since 1968 or for the past 20 years (amounting to over P400,000 by this time)
without first requiring <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> to account for the
fruits of <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga's</span> hacienda which he allegedly
squandered while it was in his possession from November 1968 up to March 3,
1975.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The payment of legal interest by <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> to <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> on the price
of P410,000 paid by <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> for <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga's</span>
3,100 shares of stock of the <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> Development
Corporation should be computed as provided in the final judgment in Civil Case
No. 2446 up to <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1972</st1:date>,
the date of said judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since <span class="SpellE">Reynoso's</span> judgment liability to <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span>
for attorney's fees and damages in the total sum of P62,000 should be set off
against the price of P410,000 that <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> is obligated
to return to <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span>, the balance of the judgment in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span> would be only P348,000 which should
earn legal rate of interest after September 30, 1972, the date of the
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the payment of said
interest by <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> should await <span class="SpellE">Reynoso's</span>
accounting of the fruits received by him from the Hacienda San Jose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon payment of P348,000 by <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga</span> to <span class="SpellE">Reynoso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Erquiaga's</span> P410,000 surety bond shall be deemed
cancelled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In all other respects, the
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 04811-SP is affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
