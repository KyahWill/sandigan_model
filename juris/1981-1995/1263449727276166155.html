<blockquote>"After due and careful deliberation, this Commission holds,
and hereby rules, that the 'demand' of the UNIDO cannot be granted and the same
is hereby denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is the considered view of this Commission that when President
Marcos conducted his '<span class="SpellE">pulong-pulong</span>' or consultation
with the people on <st1:date month="3" day="12" year="1981">March 12, 1981</st1:date>,
he did so in his capacity as President/Prime Minister of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and not as the head of any political party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the Constitution, the 'Prime Minister and the Cabinet shall be
responsible . . . . . . . . <span class="GramE">for</span> the program of
government and shall determine the guidelines of national policy' (Art. IX,
Sec. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Commission takes judicial
notice of the fact that the proposed amendments, subject of the President's
remarks in the '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>'
last March 12, 1981, were initiated under the leadership of Mr. Marcos as
President/Prime Minister in the exercise of his constitutional prerogative <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
it was President/Prime Minister Ferdinand E. Marcos who issued the special call
for the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
to convene as a constituent assembly to propose amendments to the Constitution
(Proclamation No. 2040 dated December 5, 1980).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It cannot be denied that seeking constitutional changes through the
means sanctioned by the Constitution constitutes a program of government imbued
with the nature of highest importance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The President/Prime Minister initiated this program of constitutional
remaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, his <span class="SpellE">corrollary</span> prerogative to enlighten the people on the
sense, significance, necessity and nuance of the constitutional amendments
which he wanted the people to support.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be an idle, if not absurd proposition, to declare that the
President/Prime Minister is 'responsible for the program of government and the
guidelines of policy' and yet deprive him of the right and opportunity to
inform and enlighten the people of the rationale of such initiatives without at
the same time granting the same right to the opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under our Constitution the President/Prime Minister has no
counter-part, not even the Opposition still waiting in the uncertain wings of
power.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This, precisely, was what President Marcos sought to accomplish
through the '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>'
last March 12, 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the letter dated
<st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1981</st1:date> by Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and Laurel, it was claimed that the program was the
nationwide '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span>' (underscoring
supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an admission that the
'<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span>' was for the '<span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span>',
not as head of a political party but as President/Prime Minister.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This program '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span>'
is of long standing and has been used by President/Prime Minister Marcos to
bring to the attention of the people certain matters that need to be understood
by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the President
used this program once to explain to the people the increase in the price of
gasoline and other petroleum products.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The program '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span>' is not a
political or partisan vehicle but an innovative system of participatory
democracy where the President as leader of the nation enunciates certain
programs or policies and thereafter subjected to interrogation by panelists
(common men and women) in various strategic places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is why the title is '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a one way arrangement; its format
is intended to result in effective multi-way consultation between the leader of
the nation and the people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The UNIDO or any of its leaders does not have the same
constitutional prerogatives vested in the President/Prime Minister as above
discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, it has no right to
'demand' equal coverage by media accorded President Marcos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The UNIDO, however, is free to enter into appropriate contracts
with the TV or radio stations concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Commission, however, cannot direct these media to grant free use of
their facilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First of all, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> cannot assume dictatorial powers and secondly, the
rule of equal time for campaigning as to duration and quality is not applicable
under the circumstances of this case, for the reasons above-stated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the 'demand' of the UNIDO is hereby
denied.</blockquote>

resolution.</blockquote>

COMELEC Resolution of <st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1981">March 18, 1981</st1:date>,
which denied the letters of UNIDO dated March 10 and 17, 1981 on the following
considerations:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Resolution states that the coverage of
the '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span>' on March 12, 1981 was extended to
Pres. Marcos 'in his capacity as President/Prime Minister and not as head of
any political party', who is 'responsible * * for the program of government and
shall determine the guidelines of national policy'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the radio and television coverage on
March 12<u>th</u>, did not deal with any 'program of government' <span class="GramE">nor</span> any 'guideline of national policy'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subject matter of said '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span>' <span class="GramE">were</span> a campaign for
the approval of the constitutional amendments proposed by the <u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>, for
ratification of the people with their 'YES' votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As announced by President Marcos himself and
as stated in the letter of UNIDO of March 10, 'President Marcos will lead the
campaign for 'YES' votes on the proposed constitutional amendments in the April
7 plebiscite'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The radio and television <span class="GramE">facilities throughout the country on March 12 was</span> used by
President Marcos in his capacity as political leader of the KBL political
party, and <u>not</u> in his capacity as President/Prime Minister.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Resolution states that Mr. Marcos
'initiated the amendments, he convened the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> as a constituent assembly, and he 'initiated this
program of constitutional remaking'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the proposed amendments were passed by the <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span>
under his leadership, his function as President/Prime Minister was
completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His campaign for the
ratification by the people of said amendments was no longer President/Prime
Minister, but as the political leader of KBL as the dominant political party in
the Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Resolution states that the name '<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span>' is an admission that the television and radio
coverage of said program on March 12, was utilized by Mr. Marcos 'not as head
of a political party but as President/Prime Minister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of said program is not determined
by its name but by the subject matter thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, it may be considered as a <span class="SpellE">mis</span>-use of
said program as political campaign for the purpose of inducing 'YES' votes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Resolution states that COMELEC 'cannot
direct these media to grant free use of their facilities', but UNIDO 'is free
to enter into appropriate <u>contracts</u> with the TV or radio stations
concerned'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Pres. Marcos campaigning
for 'YES' votes did not enter into such contracts, but had 'free use' of said
facilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For the
Resolution to require UNIDO to pay for time in a national radio and TV coverage
is to impose an '<u>impossible</u>' financial condition.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Resolution states that 'COMELEC can not
assume dictatorial powers'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The COMELEC
as a constitutional body has the constitutional right and power to have its
Resolutions Nos. 1497, 1498 and 1499 on equal opportunity, equal space and
equal time respected and obeyed by all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, said Resolutions will be only in form without any substance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view of the foregoing, UNIDO respectfully prays that the
Resolution of <st1:date month="3" day="19" year="1981">March 19, 1981</st1:date>
denying the request and demand of UNIDO for equal time, be reconsidered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is likewise prayed that the letter requests of UNIDO be granted
for nation-wide coverage of its public meeting at Plaza Miranda on <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1981">Saturday, March 21, 1981</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The basic grounds of the present appeal are stated in the
petition thus:</p>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Said COMELEC Resolutions, Annexes 'B' and
'D', are also contrary to the Constitution and the law, and moreover, are
unjust, unfair and inequitable, for said Resolutions <u>violate</u> the basic
principles of equality, good faith and fair play, and they are <u>not</u> conducive
to 'insure free, orderly and honest elections';</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The request and/or demand of petitioner for <u>equal
broadcast media</u> of its public meeting or rally at the Plaza Miranda last
Saturday, March 21, 1981 (ante, par. 4) was arbitrarily <u>denied</u> by respondent
COMELEC in its Resolutions (Annex 'B' and 'D').<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the political campaign of the <span class="SpellE">Kilusan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipunan</span>
(KBL) for 'YES' votes used all the radios and televisions in the <span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> of its political leader, President Ferdinand
E. Marcos, the political campaign for 'NO' votes of petitioner UNIDO should and
must be granted the <u>same</u> right and <u>equal</u> use of the same
facilities for the remaining days of the political campaign for 'NO' votes up
to the plebiscite on April 7, 1981;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These grounds were eloquently expanded by distinguished counsel
for petitioner, Senator <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> Padilla, during the
hearing held in the afternoon of <st1:date month="3" day="31" year="1981">Tuesday,
 March 31, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Much as it is indeed desirable and idealistic that the widest and
fullest opportunity to be heard and explain their side should be given to those
opposed to the proposed constitutional amendments, there are certain inexorable
rules and principles that govern the situation at hand which, no matter in what
direction one's sympathies may be inclined, have to be observed in the best
interests of all concerned as this Court sees them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indubitably, the proposed changes of the
Charter are of deep and transcendental importance, since they will affect not
only the structure of government and the democratic institutions and ideals <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the presidential and parliamentary systems to
which our people have been exposed up to the present, and they could outlast
most of us and our children and our children's children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite a number of those ideals and
institutions are fondly cherished and enshrined as sacred by some respectable
elements in the country, admittedly as knowledgeable and patriotic as those who
are advocating their alteration or modification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that the proposed constitutional
changes are purported to establish rather drastic innovations in the
distribution of at least the executive and legislative powers of the national
government, in an avowedly indigenous manner more responsive and attuned not
only to the mores, modes and <span class="SpellE">idiosyncracies</span> of our
people and the prevailing national and international circumstances, which
evidently require unusual means to preserve and defend the state and the
territorial integrity of the country, albeit such proposed reforms maintain
fundamentally the republican and democratic character of our system of
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="GramE">We</span>
reiterate, that the more the people are adequately informed about the proposed
amendments, their exact meaning, implications and nuances, the better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein <span class="GramE">lies</span> the apparent
plausibility of petitioner's pose.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are, however, certain norms which even petitioner and those
that compose it know very well that this Court, all the amplitude of its
prerogatives notwithstanding cannot disregard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Denial of due process is considered generally as the first and the most
valued right of everyone under the Bill of Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this Court to mandate the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, assuming <span class="GramE">We</span> had such
power, having in view the constriction of the Supreme Court's authority over
the actuations of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> under the new
constitution as discoursed by Us in <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, G.R. Nos. L-49705-09, February 8, 1979, 88 SCRA
251, petitioner evidently overlooks the fact that the television and radio
stations they refer to in their petition who will be directly affected by any
injunction of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> upon Our orders are not
parties to this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is elementary,
to state the obvious, that in the premises, <span class="GramE">We</span> would
be overreaching the bounds of our constitutional powers if We acceded to
petitioner's request, absent such indispensable parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, petitioner has not shown, for
apparently they have not done so, that they have requested any TV or radio
station to give them the same time and style of "<span class="SpellE">pulong-pulong</span>"
as that which they afforded the President on <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="3">March 21<span class="GramE">,1981</span></st1:date> and that their
request has been denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt the
Constitution and the Election Code provisions as well as the general <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution cited by petitioner's counsel may be
availed of, but since, We have not been informed of the circumstances under
which the President was accorded the privilege which petitioner wants to be
equally granted to them, We are not even in a position to determine under what
definite terms the order prayed for should be issued by Us, considering there
are other groups and <span class="SpellE">aggrupations</span>, not to speak of
individuals who are similarly situated as petitioner who would also want to be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are afraid <span class="GramE">We</span>
would be expecting from the TV and radio networks more than what conceivably
the Charter, the law and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolutions
contemplate, if We granted what UNIDO wants and did less for those other <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to the amendments who may come to Us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the equal time, equal space and equal quality of exposure
claimed by petitioner, it should be informative to quote the pertinent
constitutional provisions, laws and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
resolutions:</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 of Article XII-C of the Constitution circumscribes the
relevant powers of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <span class="SpellE">thiswise</span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>enjoyment or utilization of all
franchises</u> or permits for the operation of transportation and other public
utilities, <u>media of communication or information</u>, all grants, special
privileges, or concessions granted by the Government, or any subdivision,
agency, or instrumentality thereof, including any government-owned or
controlled corporation, may be <u>supervised or regulated</u> by the Commission
<u>during the election period for the purpose of ensuring free, orderly, and
honest elections</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 41 of the Election Code of 1978 pertinently reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 41.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Regulation of election propaganda through
mass media</u> - (a) The Commission shall promulgate rules and regulations
regarding the <u>sale</u> of air time for political purposes during the
campaign period to insure that time equal as to duration and quality <u>is
available to all candidates for the same office or political parties, groups or
<span class="SpellE">aggrupations</span> at the same rates or given free of
charge</u>; that such rates are reasonable and not higher than those charged
other buyers or users of air time for non-political purposes; that the
provisions of this Code regarding the limitation of expenditures by candidates
and contributions by private persons and certain classes of corporations,
entities and institutions are effectively enforced; that said radio
broadcasting and television stations shall not be allowed to schedule any program
or permit any sponsor to manifestly favor or oppose any candidate or political
party, group or <span class="SpellE">aggrupation</span> by unduly or repeatedly
referring to or including said candidate and/or political party, group or <span class="SpellE">aggrupation</span> <u>respecting, however, in all instances the
right of said stations to broadcast accounts of significant or newsworthy
events and views on matters of public interest</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sections 7 and 8 of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Resolution
No. 1468 read thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 7.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Free air time</u>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Any radio broadcasting or television station
that grants <u>free of charge the use of air time to any supporter, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, political party, group or <span class="SpellE">aggrupation</span>
shall also give similar air time free of charge to other supporters, <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, political parties, groups or <span class="SpellE">aggrupations</span>, except when such use of air time is part of a
news program or coverage involving a newsworthy event</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A radio/television station giving air time free of charge to any
supporter, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, political party/group for campaign
purposes shall inform the Commission of such fact within two days from the use
of such free time."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 8.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Failure to agree on equal time</u>.</span> ?
In case the supporter, <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>, political
party/group and the radio-television station, despite mediation by the Ministry
of Public Information, <u>cannot agree on the equal time to be sold or given
free, the controversy shall be referred to the Commission</u> whose decision on
the matter shall be final and immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot agree with the
restrictive literal interpretation the Solicitor General would want to give to
the "free, orderly and honest elections" clause of Section 5, Article
XII-C above-quoted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Government Counsel
posits that the said clause refers exclusively to the <span class="GramE">manner</span>
in which the elections are conducted, that is to say, with the manner in which
the voters are supposed to be allowed to vote.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps, such a theory may hold insofar as ordinary elections of
officials are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Court
views the provision as applicable also to plebiscites, particularly one
relative to constitutional amendments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Be it borne in mind that it has been one of the most steadfast rulings
of this Court in connection with such plebiscites that it is indispensable that
they be properly characterized to be fair submission - by which is meant that
the voters must of necessity have had adequate opportunity, in the light of
conventional wisdom, to cast their votes with sufficient understanding of what
they are voting on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are of the firm
conviction that the charter's reference to honest elections connotes fair
submission in a plebiscite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be
otherwise, for then the importance of suffrage for the election of officials
would be more significantly valued than voting on the ratification of the
constitution or any amendment thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot yield to such an unorthodox constitutional concept that
relegates the fundamental law of the land which is the source of all powers of
the government to a level less valued than the men who would run the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a voter either gives or denies his
assent to a change of the existing charter of his rights and liberties and the
existing governmental form as well as the powers of those who are to govern
him, he virtually contributes his little grain of sand to the building of the
nation and renders his share in shaping the future of its people, including
himself, his family and those to come after them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, nothing can be of more transcendental
importance than to vote in a constitutional plebiscite.</p>

<p class="BODY">In consequence of the foregoing considerations, <span class="GramE">We</span> opine and so hold that the provisions of all election
laws regulating propaganda through the mass media, for example, Section 41 of
the Election Code of 1978, must be deemed applicable to plebiscites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it is the duty of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to see to it that the sale of air time by TV and
radio stations "insure(s) that time equal as to duration and quality is
available to all candidates for the same office or political parties, groups or
<span class="SpellE">aggrupations</span> at the same rates or given free of
charge."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">We cannot share the Solicitor General's
submission that the above view would subvert or curtail correspondingly the
freedom of speech and of the press to which the TV and radio station owners are
entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, it is Our considered
opinion and We so hold that if such be the effect of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
regulations, it is because they must have been contemplated to precisely
constitute an exception to freedom-of-speech-and-press clause, on account of considerations
more paramount for the general welfare and public interest, which exceptions
after all would operate only during limited periods, that is, during the
duration of the election campaign fixed in the charter itself and/or by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General points, however, to the explicit proviso in
Section 41 to the effect that the equal-time-equal-space privilege must
"respect, - - - in all instances the right of said stations to broadcast
accounts of significant or newsworthy events and views on matters of public
interest", and suggests that the TV and radio stations may not be blamed
for considering the "<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span>" as coming within
said proviso.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is
contended that such choice by them may not then be subjected to the
equal-time-equal-space regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, counsel for petitioner maintains that it is not fair to deem
the President's "<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span>" as a
"significant and noteworthy (an) event(s) and view(s) on matters of public
interest" just because the President campaigned for "Yes" votes,
while a "<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span>" by those who would
appeal for "No" votes cannot be similarly characterized.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our holding in respect to such conflicting contentions is that,
while it may not be exactly proper to say, as the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
resolution in question puts it, that "(u)<span class="SpellE">nder</span>
our constitution, the President-Prime Minister has no counterpart, not even the
Opposition still waiting in the uncertain wings of power", it is
undeniable and but natural that the head of state of every country in the world
must, from the very nature of his position, be accorded certain privileges not
equally available to those who are opposed to him in the sense that, since the
head of state has the grave and tremendous responsibility of planning and implementing
the plan of government itself, either by virtue of the popular mandate given to
him under the corresponding provisions of the Constitution and the laws or any
other duly recognized grant of power and authority, the opposition cannot be
placed at par with him, since logically the opposition can only <span class="SpellE">fiscalize</span> the administration and <span class="SpellE">punctualize</span>
its errors and shortcomings to the end that when the duly scheduled time for
the people to exercise their inalienable power to make a better choice, the opposition
may have the chance to make them accept the alternative they can offer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, when the head of state is afforded the opportunity or
when he feels it incumbent upon him to communicate and dialogue with the people
on any matter affecting the plan of government or any other matter of public
interest, no office or entity of the government is obliged to give the
opposition the same facilities by which its contrary views may be
ventilated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the opposition leaders
feel any sense of responsibility in the premises to counter the administration,
it is up to them - and they are free - to avail of their own resources to
accomplish their purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But surely, it
is not for the administration to hand them on a silver platter the weapon they
need.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are not aware that there is any
existing system of government anywhere in the world which is mandated to be so
accommodating and generous to the opponents of the current administrators of
the national affairs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In instances where the head of state is at the same time the
president of the political party that is in power, it does not necessarily
follow that he speaks with two voices when he dialogues with the governed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unquestionably, there are matters of vital
public interest wherein partisan considerations could in some degree be
involved, but then such partisan interest would be purely secondary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President/Prime Minister of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is the political head of all the people.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His is the sacred responsibility to protect and defend the security of
all the people, the stability of the government and the integrity of the
national territory, not only for the tenure to which he has been elected but
for all times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, as in the instant
situation, he deems it warranted by the circumstances to present to them a plan
of government which includes the modification of the existing structure of
government together with its concomitant allocation of governmental powers, it
is not only his right but his duty to take the people directly into his
confidence and impart to them to the fullest measure of his capacity and by all
available adequate means the reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and the
<span class="SpellE">corollarily</span> advantages thereof to their welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opposition, if it opines otherwise, has
naturally the indisputable right to make every effort to thwart his
objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, surely, this is far from
saying that it is the duty of the administration to generously grant to them
the means to wage their campaign against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The long and short of the foregoing is that it is not true that
in speaking as he did in the "<span class="SpellE">Pulong-Pulong</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangulo</span>" on March 21,
1981, he spoke not only as President-Prime Minister but also as head of the
KBL, the political party now in power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was in the former capacity that he did so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If in any way, what he said would induce the
people to accept the proposed amendments, his exposition of the advantages
thereof was not to promote the interest of that party but to improve the
quality of the government thereby to enable him or anyone who may be chosen by
the people to take his place to better serve the welfare not only of the KBL
but of all of us, including those who are minded, for reasons of their own, to
oppose the amendments.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, petitioner has failed to persuade <span class="GramE">Us</span> that the grant of the prayer in its petition compellingly
pertains to it under the provisions of the Constitution, the Election Code of
1978 and the general resolutions and regulations of respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> regarding equal opportunity among contending
political parties, groups, <span class="SpellE">aggrupations</span> or individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has
indeed the power to supervise and regulate the mass media in such respect, but
such authority arises only when there is a showing that any sector or member of
the media has denied to any party or person the right to which it or he is
entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, there are other
political parties similarly situated as petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To grant to petitioner what it wants, it must

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>C.J.</i>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the traditional practice, constitutionally
sanctioned not only in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but also in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and <st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a
President, even if running for reelection, by virtue of the position he holds,
is necessarily in a more advantageous position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is easy for him to make use of the media for the purpose of
announcing policies of government and offering the necessary explanations as to
why they should be adopted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
sense, therefore, that with the petition based on the fact that two hours were
granted the President for his <span class="SpellE"><u>Pulong-Pulong</u></span>
program and therefore, a similar privilege should be accorded to petitioner, it
cannot be said that respondent Commission on Elections abused its discretion,
much less in a grave manner, in denying the request of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this concurrence with
the opinion of the <span style="">Court.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is, however, to my mind, certain considerations that should
not be ignored by respondent Commission in the utilization of what has come to
be known as the TV and Radio "<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
Time." The vitality of the democratic process and the support extended by
the people to the national leadership depend on the understanding of the
measures undertaken by government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
to the credit of the present administration that all issues of public interest
are fully ventilated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering how
transcendental in character <span class="GramE">are the proposed amendments</span>,
it is not only desirable but to my mind of the essence of constitutionalism
that every government agency be fully aware of the importance of the basic
concepts that lie at the foundations of our political institutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the electoral process, the equal
protection guarantee is of the utmost significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It connotes fairness to all contending
parties whenever the electorate is called upon to express its choice whether of
men or on issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution has
seen to that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The enjoyment or utilization of all
franchises or permits for the operation of transportation and other public
utilities, media of communication or information, all grants, special
privileges, or concessions granted by the Government, or any subdivision,
agency, or instrumentality thereof, including any government-owned or controlled
corporation, may be supervised or regulated by the Commission during the
election period for the purpose of ensuring free, orderly, and honest
elections."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Also, <span class="SpellE">thereis</span> this provision in the 1973
Constitution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<u>Bona</u> <u>fide</u>
candidates for any public office shall be free from any form of harassment and
discrimination."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
There is, moreover, a specific provision in the 1978 Election Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">"* </span>* * In all instances, the Commission shall supervise the
use and employment of press, radio and television facilities so as to give
candidates equal opportunities under equal circumstances to make known their
qualifications and their stand on public issues within the limits set forth in
this Code on election spending."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is my submission that while this paragraph speaks of
candidates as does the constitutional provision cited, it lends itself to an
interpretation allowing its application to the present situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission can take pride in the
fact that it has not been <span class="GramE">recreant</span> to the trust
imposed on it by virtue of the above provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolutions brought to the attention of
this Court are indicative of how far it has gone to ovoid any valid charge of
being discriminatory or unfair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will,
in my view, inspire even greater confidence if in the few remaining days before
the <span class="GramE">plebiscite,</span> it exercises its supervisory authority
to assure that the mass media accord equal access to the views espoused by
petitioner as well as other opposition groups.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That would be a signal contribution to the cause of free and honest
elections as well as free speech.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am authorized to <span style="">state </span>that
justice <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera concurs <span style="">in </span>this opinion.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i style=""><span style="">J.</span></i><span style="">:</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I am constrained to
dissent from the dismissal of the </span>petition at bar and to vote that it be
granted due course.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Occeña</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>
(G.R. No. 56350) and <u>Gonzales vs. National Treasurer</u> (G.R. No. 56404),
jointly decided on this date, April 4, 1981, I voted to enjoin the holding of
the plebiscite scheduled for April 7, 1981 on the ground, among others, that
the controlling doctrine of fair and proper submission as laid down by the
Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> specially in the light of the proposed
complex, complicated and radical changes of our structure of government
requires that the people be given adequate time and information as to the
amendments to be voted upon for their conscientious deliberation and
intelligent consent or rejection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As stressed by retired
Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> V. Sanchez in his separate </span><span style="">opinion in </span><span style="">Gonzales vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">, "(W)e believe the word 'submitted' can
only mean that the government, within its maximum capabilities, should strain
every effort to inform every citizen of the provisions to be amended, and the
proposed amendments and the meaning, nature and effects thereof. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> What the Constitution in effect directs is that the
government, in submitting an amendment for ratification, should put every
instrumentality or agency within its structural framework to enlighten the
people, educate them with respect to their act of ratification or
rejection."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was in response to
these strictures that the 1971 Constitutional Convention provided in Article
XII (C), section 5 of the 1973 Constitution that "(T)he enjoyment or
utilization of all franchises or permits for the operation of transportation
and other public utilities, media of communication or information, all grants,
special privileges, or concessions granted by the Government, or any
subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including any government-owned
or controlled corporation, may be supervised or regulated by the Commission
during the election period for the purpose of ensuring free, orderly, and
honest elections." Likewise, the Election Code of 1978 provided for
regulation by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> of election propaganda
through the mass media and the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> itself issued
its implementing Resolution No. 1468, the pertinent provisions of which are
copied in full in the majority decision.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In consonance with the views expressed by the Chief Justice in
his separate opinion, respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is fully
authorized (as it has done with its "<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
Time" on TV and radio) to issue all reasonable measures to the mass media,
particularly to the government-owned television and radio stations, to grant
petitioners as much time and space as is feasible (although understandably less
than the President-Prime Minister as head of state and government) to air and
disseminate their contrary views on the proposed amendments and enable the
voter to exercise intelligently his choice on acceptance or rejection of
"changes of the existing charter of his rights and liberties and the existing
governmental form as well as the powers of those who are to govern him" -
to borrow the language of the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here we are, on the 36th day after the adoption by the Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> of the proposed
amendments with only two more days to go before plebiscite day on <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1981</st1:date>; yet, even lawyers are
known to "have a difficult time zeroing in on the practical applications
of the [proposed] changes in the basic law of the land."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
would but faithfully discharge its constitutional duty if it fully implemented
the cited statute and regulations </span>of its own to assure the widest
dissemination of the affirmative and negative views on the proposed
amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The technical questions
raised in the majority decision as to the non-<span class="SpellE">impleader</span>
of the mass media as parties and other groups and <span class="SpellE">aggrupations</span>
who also want to be heard are mere administrative problems which the
Constitution has precisely entrusted to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to resolve and determine fairl<span style="">y </span>and equitably.</p>
