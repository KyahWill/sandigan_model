				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision of the Employees'
Compensation Commission in ECC Case No. 0070 (<span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>
Manahan, Jr., deceased), entitled "Maria Manahan, Appellant, versus
Government Service Insurance System, (Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>
Municipal High School), Respondent" affirming the decision of the
Government Service Insurance System which denied the claim for death benefit.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The claimant, petitioner herein, Maria E. Manahan, is the widow
of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> Manahan, Jr., who died of "Enteric
Fever" while employed as classroom teacher in Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>
Municipal High School, Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
on <st1:date month="5" day="8" year="1975">May 8, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a claim with the Government Service
Insurance System for death benefit under Presidential Decree 626.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1975</st1:date>, the Government Service Insurance
denied the claim on a finding that the ailment of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>
Manahan, Jr., typhoid fever, is not an occupational disease.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration on the ground
that the deceased, <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> Manahan, Jr., was in perfect
health when admitted to the service and that the ailment of said deceased was
attributable to his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government Service Insurance System affirmed the denial of
the claim on the ground that enteric fever or paratyphoid is similar in effect
to typhoid fever, in the sense that both are produced by Salmonella organisms.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed to the Employees' Compensation Commission
which affirmed the decision of the Government Service Insurance System on a
finding that the ailment of the deceased, enteric fever, was not induced by or
aggravated by the nature of the duties of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>
Manahan, Jr. as a teacher.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To support her theory that the disease of <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>
Manahan, Jr., enteric fever, resulted from his employment as classroom teacher
of the Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span> Municipal High School, the
petitioner cites the following authority:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"<u>EPIDEMOLOGY
AND PATHOLOGY OF ENTERIC FEVER</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE SOURCE OF INFECTION is feces or urine from patients and
carriers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Family contacts may be
transient carriers and 2 to 5% of patients become chronic carriers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In poorly sanitized communities, water is the
most frequent vehicle of transmission; food, especially milk, is the next most
important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In modern urban areas, food,
contaminated by healthy carriers who are food handlers, is the principal
vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flies may spread the organism
from feces to food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Direct contact
infection is infrequent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The organism enters the body through the gastrointestinal
tract, invading the blood stream by way of the lymphatic channels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is hyperplasia and often ulceration of <span class="SpellE">Pyeris</span> patches, especially in the ileum and <span class="SpellE">cecum</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
ulcers heals, no scar results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
kidneys and liver usually show <span class="SpellE">cloudly</span> swelling and
the latter may reveal a patchy necrosis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The spleen is enlarged and soft. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Rarely, the lungs show pneumonic changes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Merck Manual, 10th Edit., P. 842)"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The factual findings of the respondent Commission indicate that
the deceased was in perfect health when he entered government service on <st1:date year="1969" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1969</st1:date>, and that in the course
of his employment in 1974, he was treated for <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span>
pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He succumbed to enteric fever on <st1:date month="5" day="8" year="1975">May 8, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Enteric fever is referred to in <span style="">medical books </span>as typhoid fever (Dorland's <span style="">Illustrated Medical </span>Dictionary, 24th
Ed., p. 548) or paratyphoid fever (Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine,
6th Ed., p. 817).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its symptoms include
abdominal pain (id., p. 810<span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In discussing the clinical
manifestations of the disease, Mr. Harrison states that recovery (from enteric
or paratyphoid fever) may be followed by continued excretion of the causative
organism in the stools for several months (id., p. 817).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This lingering nature of the species
producing enteric fever points out the possibility that the illness which afflicted
the deceased in 1974 was the same as, or at least, related to, his 1975
illness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical record of the deceased shows that he had a history of
ulcer-like symptoms (p. 3, ECC rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This buttresses the claimant's claim that her husband had been suffering
from ulcer <u><span style="">several months before his
death</span></u><span style=""> </span>on <st1:date month="5" day="8" year="1975">May 8, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is likewise sustained by the medical
certificate (p. 12, ECC rec.) issued by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Aquilles</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> to the effect that "<span class="SpellE">Nazario</span>
Manahan was treated for <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span> pain probably due
to hyperacidity on December 10, 1974." <span class="SpellE">Epigastric</span>
pain is a symptom of ulcer, and ulcer is a common complication of typhoid
fever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is even such a thing as
"<span class="SpellE">typhoidal</span> ulcer" (p. 812, supra).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because of these
circumstances, the illness that claimed the life of the deceased could have </span>had
its onset months before <st1:date month="12" day="10" year="1974">December 10,
 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case,
his cause of action accrued before <st1:date month="12" day="10" year="1974">December
 10, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Corales</span> vs. ECC
(L-44063, Feb. 27, 1979), We ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Article 294, Title III
(Transitory and Final Provisions) of the New Labor Code provides that all
actions and claims accruing <u><span style="">prior</span></u><span style=""> </span>to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Code shall be determined in accordance with the laws in force <span style="">at </span>the time of their accrual and under
the third paragraph of <span style="">Article 292,
Title II (Prescription of Offenses and Claims), workmen's compensation claims
accruing prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code and
during the period from November 1, 1974 up to December 31, 1974 shall be
processed and adjudicated in accordance with the laws and rules at the time
their causes of action accrued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
this Court applied the provisions of the Workmen's </span><span style="">Compensation </span><span style="">Act, as amended, on passing upon petitioner's claim."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to such doctrine and applying now the provisions of the
Workmen's <span style="">Compensation </span>Act in
this case, the presumption of compensability subsists in favor of the claimant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, We have always maintained that in case of doubt, the
same should be resolved in favor of the worker, and that social legislations --
like the Workmen's Compensation Act and the Labor Code -- should be liberally
construed to attain their laudable objective, i.e., to give relief to the
workman and/or his dependents in the event that the former should die or
sustain an injury.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the
constitutional guarantee of social justice and protection to labor make Us take
a second look at the evidence presented by the claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a teacher of the Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span> Municipal
High School at Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
the deceased used to eat his meals at the school canteen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also used the toilet and other facilities
of the school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the respondent
Commission, <span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>it is not improbable that the deceased might
have contracted the illness during those rare moments that he was away from his
family, since it is medically accepted that enteric fever is caused by
'salmonella' organisms which are acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or
drinks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contamination of food or water
may come from the excretion of animals such as rodents, flies, or human beings who
are <span style="">sick </span>or who are carriers, or
<span style="">infection </span>in meat of animals as
food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meat, milk and eggs are the foods
most frequently involved in the transmission of this type of species, since the
organism may multiply even before ingestion x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." These findings of the respondent Commission lead
to the conclusion that the risk of contracting the fatal illness was increased
by the decedent's working condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the petition for review is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the Employees' Compensation
Commission sought to be reviewed is hereby set aside the Government Service
Insurance System is ordered:</p>
