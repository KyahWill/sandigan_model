appealed decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>,
and the July 15, 1986 resolution of the same court denying the motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy in this case involves a residential lot situated
in <span class="SpellE">Digman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, and a house constructed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

were all duly substituted.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-align:left" align="left">As found by the trial court,
the undisputed facts of this case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The late spouses Antonia San Jose and <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron, who were childless, took custody of the late <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
de Leon, who was then a baby, without formalities of legal or judicial
adoption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Together, they lived in a
conjugal house on the land, now in question, in <span class="SpellE">Digman</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1955" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1955</st1:date>,
Antonio San Jose died, leaving a last will and testament, which was duly
probated by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> in
a decision rendered on <st1:date year="1955" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1955</st1:date>

<p class="BODY">In March, 1955, <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron, the
widow, at her own expense, caused the demolition of the said conjugal house and
replaced it with a new one (now in question) on the same spot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon
consented to and even helped in said construction, and thereafter, lived
therein with his family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon and his family moved and settled
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Project of Partition dated December 15, 1955 (Exhibit
"E") duly executed by <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon and <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron, Item "H", consisting of one (1)
residential lot at <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, covered by Tax Declaration No. 6108 and
assessed at P740.00, was assigned and adjudicated in favor of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said project of partition was duly approved by the probate court in an
Order dated <st1:date year="1956" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1956</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of the administrator of the
estate, the court <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">a</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> <u>q</u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

(Exhibit "G") ordering the distribution of the estate of the deceased
Antonio San Jose among his heirs in accordance with the aforesaid project of
partition (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 9).</p>

<p class="BODY">When de Leon returned in 1959, he found private respondents
spouses <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Cruz and Maria Reyes occupying the
house together with <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When said occupants refused to vacate the premises,
<span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon, on <st1:date year="1959" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1959</st1:date>, filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case, Civil Case No. 113, with the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
claiming ownership of the house in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer, it was alleged that <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron is the true and legitimate owner of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She built it at her own expense after the
death of her husband and prior to the preparation and approval of the Project
of Partition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The house is now covered
by Tax Declaration No. 7101 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron as lawful owner thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents pointed out that only the residential lot, without any
house, has been adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon in
the Project of Partition dated <st1:date year="1955" day="15" month="12">December
 15, 1955</st1:date> and approved by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> in its order dated <st1:date year="1956" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1956</st1:date>, with the express approval of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
such, he is in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to impugn the validity and
legality of the adjudication to him of the lot only, without the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the alternative, they raised the defense that <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron is a builder in good faith since that
improvement was constructed at a time when said <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
lot was still part of the conjugal property of <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron and the deceased Antonio San Jose, and that under Article 448 of the
Civil Code, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon has the option to pay
the value of the improvement which is greater than the lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1957" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1957</st1:date>,
the Justice of the Peace Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>, finding
that the case involved conflicting claims on the ownership of the house subject
of litigation, dismissed the same for lack of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal was appealed to the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, and the same was docketed
therein as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Civil </span>Case No. 143 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 205).</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="1">January
 2, 1962</st1:date>, while the said Civil Case No. 143 was pending, <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon filed Civil Case No. 411 against the same
defendants in Civil Case No. 143, for recovery of possession of the lot and
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In both cases, defendants,
particularly <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron, claimed, among other
defenses, the right of a builder in good faith under Article 448 of the Civil
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">While these cases were pending, <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron died on <st1:date year="1963" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1963</st1:date>
and was substituted by respondents spouses <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
Cruz and Maria Reyes on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="11">November 6,
 1964</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1964</st1:date>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon, for the sum of P15,700.00, sold the
questioned lot (more or less 930 square meters) and the house (Record, pp.
84-85) to Vicente Santos, petitioner herein, without notice to the trial court
nor to private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sale was
duly registered with the Registry of Deeds for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1964</st1:date> (Exhibit
"A-1-A").</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 25, 1964, petitioner wrote a letter (Exhibit
"H") to respondent Maria Reyes, advising her that he had acquired
title over the parcel of land, the house and the "<span class="SpellE">camalig</span>"
being occupied by them and that he now needs the property in the pursuit of his
business, for which reason, he demanded that they vacate the premises and
surrender the same to him within ten (10) days from receipt thereof, including
the payment of P500.00 monthly rental from April 2, 1964 for the use of the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This letter was received by
the addressee through mail as evidenced by the Registry Return Card presented
as Exhibit "H-1" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 27).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Complaint in Intervention in Civil Case No. 411 claiming
that he bought the litigated land with an area of 930 square meters from <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1965</st1:date>,
petitioner sent another letter to respondent Maria Reyes (Exhibit
"I") reiterating his demand to vacate the premises and the payment of
P500.00 monthly rentals from <st1:date year="1964" day="2" month="4">April 2,
 1964</st1:date> within five (5) days from receipt.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her reply of May 16, 1965 (Exhibit "J"), respondent
Maria Reyes stated that petitioner has no right to collect the rental demanded
considering that the property acquired is still under litigation, to which,
petitioner, in his letter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of May </span>20,
1965 (Exhibit "K"), made the rejoinder that it is only the house
which is the subject of litigation and that the lot is never involved in the
suit between respondent and respondent <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de
Leon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer to the complaint-in-intervention, the spouses Maria
Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Cruz </span>claimed that <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon had
no right to sell the land because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
a case wherein <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> sought the annulment of the
Project of Partition involving the land where the house is constructed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As counterclaim, respondents invoked the
rights of pre-emption appertaining to a builder in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, petitioner had a parcel of land he bought from <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon, surveyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1967</st1:date>,
the Director of Lands approved the survey plan over the land, designated as
Psu-216172 (Exhibit "B") showing a total area of 1,937 square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1969</st1:date>,
the trial court dismissed said Civil Case No. 411 without prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aforesaid Civil Cases Nos. 143 and N-411 were revived by the
petitioner, filing with the trial court on <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1972</st1:date>, Civil Case No. N-1762 (later known as Civil
Case No. B-16), against herein private respondents together with <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon for recovery of the subject land, now
claimed to be 1,937 square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Answer with Counterclaim and a Cross-Claim (Records, pp.
26-34), private respondents aver that the area of the subject land is only 930
square meters, more or less, and that petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from claiming that its area is 1,937 square meters; that the land area in
excess of 930 square meters, and north of subject land, is a public land
covered by Miscellaneous Sales (III-I) Application No. 633 of respondent
Medina, filed with the Bureau of Lands, who actually occupied said public land,
introducing improvements thereon; that the court has no jurisdiction over said
public land, jurisdiction being with the Bureau of Land<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">s</span>; that as builder in good faith, they are entitled to retention
of subject land, without obligation to pay rental until <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
de Leon shall have exercised the option; that they have preferential rights to
buy the subject land; and that the sale of subject land by <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
de Leon to Vicente Santos is <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span> or <span class="SpellE">annulable</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their
cross-claim against their co-respondent <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de
Leon, they asserted ownership of the house in question, sought enforcement of
their rights as builders in good faith, and prayed for a rescission of the sale
of subject land for being in fraud of private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a protracted trial, the question of ownership of said house
was settled, when on October 18, 1973, respondent <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
de Leon (as cross-defendant) and respondents spouses Maria Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> S. Cruz (as cross-claimants) filed a Motion to
Approve Compromise Agreement (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 44, 46), wherein <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon admitted that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the house in question was constructed by <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron Reyes, at her own expense, on the portion
of the land pertaining to the conjugal partnership property of the spouses
Antonio San Jose and <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron Reyes, prior to
his acquisition of the said lot; (2) he was prevailed upon by petitioner, who
was aware of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Cases Nos. 143 and
N-411 and was even his financier in the said cases, to sell the land in
question to him (petitioner); <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(3) </span>he
did not offer to buy the house from respondents spouses nor from their
predecessor-in-interest <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron Reyes, nor
did he offer to sell the questioned land to them; (4) he did not notify them of
his intention to sell the land in question; (5) that he decided to sell the
land to petitioner; (6) that he sold to petitioner the parcel of land in
question with an area of 930 square meters only, and the excess portion is a
public land which is actually occupied by respondents spouses <span class="SpellE">Edwardo</span> Medina and <span class="SpellE">Luceria</span> Reyes;
(7) that he recognizes the right of private respondents to purchase the land on
which the house in question is erected; and (8) that he recognizes their right
to a rescission of the contract of sale of subject lot between him and
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said Compromise Agreement
was signed by private respondents Maria Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>
S. Cruz on the one hand and by <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon on
the other, assisted by their respective counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Compromise Agreement was approved by the
trial court in an order dated <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="10">October
 22, 1973</st1:date> as its judgment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>.,

<p class="BODY">The Second Division of this Court, after the required pleadings

resolution of <st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1989</st1:date>
and required the parties to submit simultaneously their respective

petitioner filed his memorandum on <st1:date year="1989" day="29" month="5">May

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp. 203-225).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the ownership of the lot bequeathed by
the late Antonio San Jose to <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon but
only as to the ownership of the house built thereon by the surviving spouse <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron immediately after the death of her husband
<st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question at issue is whether or not <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron was a builder in good faith and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
</span>such, is entitled to the rights of pre-emption prescribed under Article
448 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it must be stated that pursuant to Article 527 of
the Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Code, </span>which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Art. 527.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Good faith
is always presumed, and upon him who alleges bad faith on the part of a
possessor rests the burden of proof."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The late <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron, predecessor-in-interest of private respondents, except <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon, has in her favor the presumption that she
constructed the house in question in good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly argued by private respondents, there
is no allegation in the complaint that even remotely suggests that the late <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron was a builder in bad faith; that there is
not even a scintilla of proof, attempting to show that she was in bad faith;
and that in such situation, presumption of good faith remains (<span class="SpellE">Sideco</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>, 13 Phil.
342).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the presumption of
innocence is given because every person should be presumed honest until the
contrary is proved (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Rapinan</span>, 1 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Phil.
294).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, on equitable grounds,
she </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>entitled to the
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron
constructed the house on the lot in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">question
sometime in March, 1955, less than a </span>month after her husband died on
February <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">27, 1955 </span>and before the
approval of a project of partition submitted on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">or about </span>February 21, 1956 in Sp. Proc. No. 5668, made for the
purpose of segregating the house from the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is of record that when Barron gave her conformity to the project of
partition what was included in the estate of her husband and allotted to <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon as one of his shares in the inheritance,
is the lot only, now covered by Tax Declaration No. 6108 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 29).</p>

<p class="BODY">It, therefore, stands to reason that when <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron constructed the house she thought that said land was still her conjugal
property unknowing that it was the same land bequeathed by her husband to <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon, the ownership and possession of which, by
the latter, retroacted as of February 27, 1955, the death of the testator
(Article 777, Civil Code; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 73).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the error in the identification of
the land, if any, is attributable not only to <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span>
Barron alone but also to <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon who as
earlier stated, not only consented but also helped in the construction of the
house in litigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, under similar
circumstances, this Court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The proof clearly shows that the defendant went into
possession of the land in question and erected her house thereon by and with
the permission of the plaintiff, and <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in good
faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The improvement thus <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">made by the defendant, can not become the
property of the plaintiff except upon paying a due consideration to the
defendant." </span>(<span class="SpellE">Aringo</span> v. Arena, 14 Phil.
263, 268 [1909]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the final analysis, it is more reasonable to believe that bad
faith lies in the actuations of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> de Leon as
shown by his admissions in a compromise agreement that knowing the rights of <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> Barron over the property he sold the parcel of
land to petitioner without notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can de Leon claim that as there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">is </span>no dispute as to the ownership of the land, the same is not
in litigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, respondents'
claim of pre-emption and right of retention placed the same under litigation
and subject to disposition by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Having opted to sell the land, de Leon is bound under the law to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">sell </span>the same to Barron and not to
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the sale of the land
to petitioner is <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span> under Article 1381,
Civil Code, paragraph 4.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise established that petitioner is a buyer in bad
faith, on the <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> testimony of <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Cruz, that he told the petitioner at the wake of
Barron that the cases against subject property are still pending and that the
same involved both house and land (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 217).</p>

<p class="BODY">Ultimately, respondent court did not err in declaring the sale of
subject land invalid for being in fraud of creditors and rescinded, under
Article 1381 of the Civil Code, paragraph 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>More accurately, the sale was <span class="SpellE">rescissible</span>
because the property was then under litigation.</p>
