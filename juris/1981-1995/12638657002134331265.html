				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> (which We treat as
a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>) seeks to annul the decision of
the National Labor Relations Commission dated November 29, 1988, which reversed
the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated February 10, 1988 in NLRC-NCR Case No.
12-4861-86 (<span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Barcenas</span>
v. Rev. <span class="SpellE">Sim</span> See, etc., et al.) on the ground that no <span style="">employer-employee relationship exists between
the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleged in her position paper the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1978, Chua Se Su (Su, for short) in his capacity as the Head
Monk of the Buddhist Temple of Manila and <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City
and as President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the <span class="SpellE">Poh</span> <span class="SpellE">Toh</span> Buddhist Association of
the <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>. Inc. hired the petitioner who speaks the
Chinese language as secretary and interpreter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's position required her <span style="">to
</span>receive and assist Chinese visitors to the temple, act as tourist guide
for foreign Chinese visitors, attend to the callers of the Head Monk as well as
to the food for the temple visitors, run errands for the Head Monk such as
paying the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>, PLDT, <span style="">MWSS </span>bills and act as liaison in some government offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from her pay and allowances under the
law, she received an amount of P500.00 per month plus free board and lodging in
the <span style="">temple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In December, 1979, Su assumed the </span>responsibility
of paying for the education of petitioner's nephew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1981, Su and petitioner had amorous
relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In May, 1982, or five months
before giving birth to the alleged son of Su on <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1982</st1:date>, petitioner was sent home to <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
death of Su in July, 1983, complainant remained and continued in her job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1985, respondent Manuel Chua (Chua, for
short) was elected President and Chairman of the Board of the <span class="SpellE">Poh</span> <span class="SpellE">Toh</span> Buddhist Association of
the Philippines, Inc. and Rev. <span class="SpellE">Sim</span> Dee (<st1:place>Dee</st1:place>,
for short) was <span style="">elected Head Buddhist
Priest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Chua and Dee
discontinued payment of her monthly allowance and the additional P500.00
effective 1983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, petitioner
and her son were evicted forcibly from their quarters in the temple by six
police officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was brought first
to the Police precinct in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> and then brought to
Aloha Hotel where she was compelled to sign a written undertaking not to return
to the Buddhist temple in consideration of the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner refused and Chua shouted threats
against her and her son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her personal
belongings including assorted jewelries were never returned by respondent Chua.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Chua and Dee, on the other hand, claimed that petitioner was
never an employee of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Poh</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Toh</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Temple</st1:placetype></st1:place>
but a servant who confined herself to the temple and to the personal needs of
the late Chua Se Su and thus, her position is co-<span class="SpellE">terminous</span>
with that of her master.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1988</st1:date>,
the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
in favor of the complainant <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Barcenas</span>, and the respondent corporation is hereby ordered
to pay her the following:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission
which, as earlier stated, reversed the above decision of the Labor
Arbiter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this
instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A painstaking review of
the records compels <span class="GramE">Us</span> to dismiss the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, however, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with
the petitioner's claim that she was a regular employee of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Buddhist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Temple</st1:placetype></st1:place>
as secretary and interpreter of its Head Monk, Su.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Head Monk, President and Chairman of the
Board of Directors of the <span class="SpellE">Poh</span> <span class="SpellE">Toh</span>
Buddhist Association of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Su was empowered to hire the petitioner under Article V of the By-laws of the
Association which states:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (T<span class="GramE">)he</span> President or in his absence, the Vice President shall
represent the Association in all its dealings with the public, subject to the
Board, shall have the power to enter into any contract or agreement in the name
of the Association, shall manage the active business operation of the
Association, shall deal with the bank or banks x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent NLRC represented by its Legal Officer<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
argues that since petitioner was hired without the approval of the Board of
Directors of the <span class="SpellE">Poh</span> <span class="SpellE">Toh</span>
Buddhist Association of the Philippines, Inc., she was not an employee of
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is
specious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The required Board approval
would appear to relate to the acts of the President in representing the
association "in all its dealings with the public." And, even granting
that prior Board approval is required to confirm the hiring of the petitioner,
the same was already granted, albeit, tacitly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be noted that petitioner was hired in 1978 and no whimper of
protest was raised until this present controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the work that petitioner performed in the temple could
not be categorized as mere domestic work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span style="">We </span>find that
petitioner, being proficient in the Chinese language, attended to the visitors,
mostly Chinese, who came to pray or seek advice before Buddha for personal or
business problems; arranged meetings between these visitors and Su and
supervised the preparation of the food for the temple visitors; acted as
tourist guide of foreign visitors; acted as liaison with some government
offices; and made the payment for the temple's <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>,
MWSS and PLDT bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, these tasks
may not be deemed activities of a household helper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were essential and important to the
operation and religious functions of the temple.</p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of this finding, her status as a regular employee ended
upon her return to <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> in May, 1982 to await the
birth of her lovechild allegedly by Su.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records do not show that petitioner filed any leave from work or
that a leave was granted her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
did she return to work after the birth of her child on <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1982</st1:date>, whom she named Robert Chua
alias Chua <span class="SpellE">Sim</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC found that it was only in July, 1983
after Su died that she went back to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Buddhist</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Temple</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's pleadings failed to rebut this
finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, her return could not
be deemed as a resumption of her old position which she had already abandoned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner herself supplied the reason for
her return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stated:</p>

<blockquote>"... (I)t was the death-bed instruction to her by Chua Se Su
to stay at the temple and to take care of the two boys and to see to it that <span style="">they </span>finish their studies to become
monks and when they are monks to eventually take over the two temples as their
inheritance from their father Chua Se Su."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, her return to the temple was no
longer as an employee but rather as Su's mistress who is bent on protecting the
proprietary and hereditary rights of her son and nephew. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In her pleadings, the petitioner claims that
they were forcefully evicted from the <span class="GramE">temple,</span> harassed
and threatened by respondents and that the <span class="SpellE">Poh</span> <span class="SpellE">Toh</span> Buddhist Association is a trustee corporation with the
children as <span class="SpellE"><u>cestui</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>que</u></span>
trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These claims are not proper in
this labor case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should be
appropriately threshed out in the complaints already filed by the petitioner
before the civil courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to these
claims, We view the respondents' offer of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as indicative more of their desire to evict the petitioner <span style="">and her son from the temple rather than an
admission of an employer-employee relations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the petitioner's claim for unpaid wages since May, 1982
which she filed only in 1986, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the same
has already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article
292 of the Labor Code, all money claims arising from employer-employee
relations must be filed within three years from the time the cause of action
accrued, otherwise they shall forever be barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, while petitioner contends that she continued to work in
the temple after Su died, there is, however, no proof that she was re-hired by
the new Head Monk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, she herself
manifested that respondents made it clear to her in no uncertain terms that her
services as well as her presence and that of her son were no longer needed.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
However, she persisted and continued to work in the temple without receiving
her salary because she expected Chua and Dee to relent and permit the studies
of the two boys.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, under these circumstances, no employer-employee relationship
could have arisen.</p>
