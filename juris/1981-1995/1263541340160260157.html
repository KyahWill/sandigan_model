				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Petitioner Vicente Ouano, now deceased, filed during his lifetime, with the then Court of First Instance of Cebu, Branch VI, an action against his father Arsenio Ouano, and his uncles and aunts, all private respondents herein, for the recovery of the paraphernal property of his late mother (Civil Case No. R-14254).&nbsp; After trial, the lower Court dismissed the complaint.&nbsp; He then filed a petition for leave to appeal as pauper, which was granted.&nbsp; He did not file a record on appeal.<br><br>Private respondents moved to dismiss the appeal for failure of petitioner to file his record on appeal within the reglementary period.&nbsp; The lower Court granted the motion and disallowed the appeal.<br><br>Petitioner then filed with respondent Appellate Court a petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and <i>Mandamus</i> contending that as a pauper litigant he was not required to submit a separate record on appeal under Section 16, Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, and prayed that the trial Court be ordered to elevate the entire original records of Civil Case No. R-14254 for purposes of has appeal.&nbsp; Respondent Appellate Court dismissed the petition and denied reconsideration as well.<br><br>Petitioner elevated the case to this Court in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> filed in <i>forma pauperis</i>.&nbsp; This First Division treated the petition as a special civil action, required the parties to submit simultaneous memoranda, and referred the case to the Court <i>en banc</i>.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></sup> The Court <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> referred the case back to this Division.<br><br>On May 17, 1980, petitioner died and was substituted by his surviving spouse Querina Arraz Ouano, and their two (2) minor children, Vicente Ouano, Jr. and Anna Loraine Ouano.&nbsp;
