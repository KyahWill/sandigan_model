<p class="BODY"><span>The prosecution evidence as synthesized by the People's

<blockquote>In the late afternoon of <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1980</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> was on her way home walking along the narrow 
street of <span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span> in Sta. Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pampanga</span></span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her companions were the

nephew of her husband, <span class="SpellE">Librado</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, and her eleven year old son Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> was walking behind the deceased, followed by her 
son, when suddenly the brothers Alejandro and <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Paras</span> rushed them from behind.<span>&nbsp; </span>Alejandro 
pulled the deceased by the shoulder, while <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> 
held his hands behind to prevent him from defending himself.<span>&nbsp;

and hit <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> on the head with it.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Whereupon, Alejandro drew out <span class="GramE">a hunting</span> knife 
and stabbed the victim in the stomach.<span>&nbsp; </span>At this instance, 
accused-appellant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, <em>alias</em>

boxing, kicking and throwing hollow blocks at the victim.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> tried to 
pacify the attackers by shouting, "Do not kill him, do not kill him", and by 
embracing the victim from behind to the extent of injuring her hands in the 
process and had to be treated at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span></st1:placename>

<blockquote>The assailants then fled leaving the deceased lying on his back 
unconscious.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> started

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the following appears in the Appellant's

Pat. <span class="GramE">Rogelio Alfonso and <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Viray</span>.</span></blockquote>

</span><span>While he was walking along <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span>, Sta. Lucia, he saw his nephew, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, wounded lying on the 
road, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> requested 
him to carry him but because he was afraid he ran to the house of his <span class="SpellE">Kakang</span> <span class="SpellE">Ising</span> and reported the same 
to her.<span>&nbsp; </span>He stayed in that house, slept there and did not leave the 
place.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He stayed in the house of Feliciana <span class="SpellE">Usi</span> for 
three days and returned to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> 
thereafter.<span>&nbsp; </span>He went home to <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> many times and all the while he did not know 
that he was being implicated in the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>When he was arrested on 
<st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1984</st1:date> by the 
INP of <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, 
he was not informed of the reason why he was being apprehended (<em>Ibid.</em>, 
pp. 11-27).</blockquote>
<blockquote>Pat. Rogelio Alfonso testified that he is a member of the <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Police 
Station.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="3">March 11,

dated <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1980</st1:date> and 
read the entries made therein regarding the death of <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> wherein accused 
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> was not among those reported as 
suspect in the death of said <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 3-6, <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1985</st1:date>).</blockquote>

averred that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> is his cousin and that 
Alejandro, <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>, Alberto and Gregorio all surnamed 
<span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, were his nephews while Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> is his brother-in-law.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1980</st1:date> between <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00

making an accounting of the expenses on the death and burial of <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> he heard about the 
stabbing incident.<span>&nbsp; </span>He along with his brothers and his

by <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>. 
Thereafter he heard Consolation <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> saying "do 
not kill him" at the same time embracing <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Later on he saw <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> lying dead and

crawling.<span>&nbsp; </span>His brother brought <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>

pp. 7-11, <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="3">March 11, 
1985</st1:date>).<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>After a study of the case, <span class="GramE">We</span> have 
come to the conclusion that, there is greater credibility on </span><span>the 
part </span><span>of the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>There </span><span>is of </span><span>course no question 
about the participation and </span><span>liability </span><span>of the <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>' family.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>We 
</span><span>are concerned here merely with the actuations of appellant <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We do not believe <span class="SpellE">Viray's</span> 
assertion that he did not participate at all in the attack and that he was not 
present when the crime was taking place.<span>&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> saw him 
leading the second attack on the fallen <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>And on this matter she was 
corroborated by her young son Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both saw <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> pick up a piece of hollow block with which he hit 
<span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We quote from the transcript (quoted in the Appellant's 
Brief). <span class="GramE">re</span> the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>Q<span> </span><span>&nbsp; </span>Then what happened with <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> when he was hit 
with a hollow block and stabbed on the stomach by the two <span class="SpellE">parases</span>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>A<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp; </span>He fell on the ground.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Q<span> </span><span>&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> was already lying 
on the ground, what else happened?</blockquote>
<blockquote>A<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, his father and brothers 
came led by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> then Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, then Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and 
Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>Q<span> </span><span>&nbsp; </span>W</span>hen these persons you 
have just mentioned arrived at the place where <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> was <span class="GramE">lying</span>, what did they do?</blockquote>
<blockquote>A<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp; </span>They got pieces of hollow block and 
hit him on the <span class="GramE">head,</span> they kicked him and boxed him, 
sir." (pp. 9-11, <st1:date year="1985" day="6" month="2">Feb. 6, 
1985</st1:date>).</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>With respect to the existence of a conspiracy, <span class="GramE">We</span> quote with approval the following apt observations of the 
Solicitor General:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>However, he contends that the prosecution failed to establish by 
clear and convincing evidence that his participation <span>was </span>by virtue 
of a pre-conceived plan or conspiracy between him and the other accused.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In <span class="SpellE">suport</span> thereof, he points out, that, 
according to <span class="SpellE">Manansala's</span> testimony, when appellant, 
along with Alberto, Gregorio and Juan, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, arrived at the scene of the incident, the deceased 
was already lying on the ground seriously wounded, if not already 
dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote>This pretence is devoid of merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>True, that the same 
degree of proof necessary to establish the crime is required to support a 
finding of the presence of a criminal conspiracy.<span>&nbsp; </span>But it is 
equally true that direct proof is not essential to prove conspiracy which may be 
established by the facts and circumstances surrounding the case.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>And in the instant case, the existence of conspiracy is amply shown by 
the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated indubitably show that the 
malefactors acted in concert pursuant to the same objective.<span>&nbsp; </span>While 
appellant was not in sight when the brothers Alejandro and <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> commenced mauling 
and stabbing the deceased, the fact that he appeared immediately thereafter and, 
together with the other two <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> brothers, Gregorio 
and Alberto, and their father, Juan, joined in assaulting the victim by kicking 
and hitting him with hollow blocks, can lead to no other logical conclusion that 
that appellant was part of the conspiracy to kill the deceased.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Surely, no one will believe that appellant just happened to be around at 
the time and that he acted independently of the four <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> brothers and their father.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, his 
flight after the incident leans heavily against his <span class="SpellE">innocense</span>.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Anent treachery or <span class="SpellE"><em>alevosia</em></span> be 
it noted among other things that appellant (and the rest) continued to hit and 
kick the victim, even when he was already unconscious, to m<span>ake sure 
</span>he would die.</p>
