Bautista, and those in G.R. No. 71728, Pablo Silva, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
Cruz and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span>, were charged before the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>
together with Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> and <span class="SpellE">Barulio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Darum</span>, with a violation of Section 3, paragraphs (e)
and (j) of Republic Act No. 3019. <span class="GramE">as</span> amended,
otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The (amended)
indictment against them reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about March 1, 1977 or for sometime prior thereto,
in Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>, Laguna, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the accused Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>,

to them while giving <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>
unwarranted benefits, advantage and preference."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After due proceedings and trial, the Second Division of the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>
promulgated judgment dated June 27, 1985, finding all the accused guilty of the
charges against them, except Mayor Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>,
who was acquitted. The dispositive portion of the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span> decision reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Darum</span> y Cruz, Cesar <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span> y <span class="SpellE">Basbas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cagongon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Bautista y
Santos, Pablo Silva y Salvador and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Cruz y <span class="SpellE">Canare</span> GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in the Violation of
Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3, paragraph (e) as amended, ** and hereby
sentences each of them to suffer the indeterminate penalty ranging from THREE
(3) YEARS as minimum, to SIX (6) YEARS as maximum; to further suffer perpetual
disqualification from public office, and to pay their proportionate costs of
this action.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Three (3) separate petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i> of
this judgment of conviction ware filed with this Court by the accused. As
already intimated, two of these, docketed as G.R. Nos. 71651 and 71728, were
filed respectively by <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Bautista, on the one hand, and Pablo
Silva, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Cruz and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span>,
on the other. These are hereby jointly decided. The third appeal, docketed as
G.R. No. 72230, was perfected by <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> <span class="SpellE">Darum</span>, but this was given short shrift; it was summarily
dismissed for lack of merit by Resolution dated October 10, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents are largely undisputed, most having in fact been
admitted by the defense in the proceedings in the <span class="SpellE"><i>Sandiganbayan</i></span>
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 71651, pp. 56 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">et seq</i>.)</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 19, 1919, a parcel of land in Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>, adjoining Laguna de Bay, with an area of 589 sq. m.,
was registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Ciriaca</span> Arguelles <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>,
to whom was issued Original Certificate of Title No. 989. The land was later
inherited by her heirs, who obtained Transfer Certificate of Title No. 33393 in
their names.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1962 the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span> instituted an <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">accion</i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span></i> in
the Court of First Instance of Laguna (docketed as Case B-350) to recover
possession of a portion of their property which had been intruded into by <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> and Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Lanuzo</span>: Judgment was rendered in the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>'
favor on January 3, 1966. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lanuzo</span> appealed to the Court of Appeals but to no avail.
That Court affirmed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></i> on February 7, 1974 the judgment of the Trial
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1964, the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span> caused the
survey of an additional area of 2,387 sq. m. which had accrued to their
property through the natural action of the waters of the Laguna de Bay. The
survey plan was duly drawn up, identified as PSU-20837. The plan divided the
additional area into two (2) lots and was in due course approved by the
Director of Lands on November 16, 1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span> thereafter filed with
the Court of First Instance an application pursuant to the Torrens Act for the
registration in their names of said additional portion of land, and also prayed
that the land be subdivided into six (6) parcels in accordance with their
respective shares as co-owners. The case was docketed as LRC Case No. <span class="GramE">B-327.</span> The proceedings were temporarily suspended in view of
the appeal in the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">accion</i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span></i>
(Case B-350), supra. But after the dismissal of that appeal, the proceedings
were resumed and resulted in a decision dated September 28, 1978 confirming the
<span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>' title. The Court subsequently directed:
(1) on February 9, 1979 that the <span class="SpellE">correspondingdecree</span>
issue in the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>' favor; (2) on June 19, 1980
that the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span> be placed in possession of the
lots registered in their names; and (3) on December 16, 1980, that the sheriff
demolish the houses and/or <span class="SpellE">imrovements</span> of the
occupants thereof. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Rollo</i></span>, G.R. No. 71651, pp. 14-15:219-220.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Months before the adjudication of the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">accion</i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span></i> or sometime in May, 1978, the
<span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span> discovered that someone had constructed a
swimming pool on a portion of their land. Investigation by their attorney soon
disclosed that in March, 1977, District Land Officer <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Darum</span> had issued to <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>, brother of Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>
Mayor Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>, Free Patent No. 12807 with
Original Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">P-1268 (for 417 sq. m.) and
Free Patent No. 22808 with OCT No.</span> <span class="GramE">P-1269 (for 515 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>.).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said free patents and titles were issued by <span class="SpellE">Darum</span>
principally on the basis of (1) applications for free patents presented by <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>; (2) the
certificates of inspection, prepared relative to said applications by Cesar <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span>, Land Inspector in the Bureau of Lands District
Land Office, in which it was stated that the property was originally owned by <span class="SpellE">Gliceria</span> <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> who sold the land
to <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Bautista, a Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>
Market Collector; and that the latter in turn sold his rights to <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> through a
"Deed of Waiver and Transfer of Rights," notarized by Mayor Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>; and (3) affidavits of Pablo Silva, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> claiming continuous occupation and cultivation of
the land by the latter. It was Cesar <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span> who
admittedly filled up the Free Patent forms and drew up the supporting
documents. The patents and titles were issued by <span class="SpellE">Darum</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> without
a survey plan of the land duly approved by the Director of Lands as required by
R.A. No. 6516 (<span class="SpellE">eff</span>., July 22, 1972). (<span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rollo</i></span>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">id.</i>, pp. 11-14<span class="GramE">;215</span>-218.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Darum</span> manifested his opposition to the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>' application for title (LRC Case No. <span class="GramE">B-327) by writing to the Land Registration Commissioner on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 6, 1979</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> to request abatement of the issuance of the decree to the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>.</span> He also filed, ostensibly in behalf of
the Director of Lands, a âMotion to Set Aside Order for Issuance of a Decreeâ,
but this was denied due course on account of his failure to show his authority
as well as his voluntary withdrawal of his appearance in the proceedings. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rollo</i></span>,
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">id.</i>, pp. 59-60.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span> filed a motion before
the CFI accusing <span class="SpellE">Darum</span>, <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> brothers, and several John Does of
contempt of court, for having issued or caused the issuance of free patents and
titles over the land while registration proceedings involving it, as part of a larger
parcel, were pending. On <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1981</st1:date>,
the Court issued an order finding the accused guilty of contempt of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was in the light of these antecedents and the other evidence
on that, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span> convicted all the
accused except Mayor <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>. In the Court's view --</p>

<blockquote>"When accused <span class="SpellE">Darum</span> and <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span> processed and caused the approval and issuance of
the free Patents in question, based on the technical descriptions of the lots
covered thereby but which survey plan was not approved yet by the Director of
Lands as required by Republic Act No 6516, or without exerting due or even
ordinary diligence in ascertaining the actual owner or occupants of said land
from their own office records or from the Bureau of Lands, they thus acted with
gross inexcusable negligence. And when they awarded the patents to accused <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>, under such
circumstances, they also acted with evident bad faith and manifest partiality
in granting undue or unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to said
patentee and to the prejudice or injury of the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>.
Accused <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>,
Bautista, Cruz and Silva, on their part, are likewise liable as co-principals
in this fraudulent scheme as they fully well knew that they had no real or
positive basis, factual or legal, for their preparation of supporting documents
of the application for free Patents and which documents are clearly suspicious
or fraudulent. Under Section 3, paragraph (e), their collective liabilities
have been clearly established by the evidence to sustain conviction <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>. Hence, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no more
necessity to discuss their liabilities under Section 3, paragraph (j), which is
just another mode of commission of the offense.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>
ruled that contrary to the contentions of the accused --</p>

<p class="BODY">1) the evidence, inclusive of the admitted facts, more than
adequately established the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>' title to the
property in question, alluding to specific facts and circumstances
demonstrating their and their predecessor's possession and exercise of dominion
dating from 1919;</p>

<p class="BODY">2) <span class="GramE">the</span> exhibits submitted by the defense
were "not true and actual documents in existence in 1975 and were probably
manufactured and/or ante-dated to support the defense theory of good
faith," it appearing --</p>

<blockquote>a) "very suspicious that <span class="SpellE">Almeda's</span>
application does not bear the marital consent ** of her husband and does not
include the details of her 1959 residence certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>
15-Meneses);</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) <span class="GramE">that</span> "from <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1959</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1959" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1959</st1:date>. while certain proceedings allegedly
took place in connection with <span class="SpellE">Almeda's</span> application,
there was a hiatus from October 29, 1959 up to August 12, 1963, on which latter
date <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> was supposed to have paid P21.48 as fees
for her use and occupation of the land (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
11-Meneses); **(and) there is another gap of time up to January 21, 1966 when <span class="SpellE">Almeda's</span> affidavit of waiver in favor of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Bautista was allegedly submitted to the Land
Management Division (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span> 14 and 33-Meneses);</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) that "Exhibits 8-to-12-Meneses, inclusive were all secured
by counsel for <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> only on September 13,1983
allegedly from the Natural Resources District No IV-2 Bureau of Lands, Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>, Laguna, and not from the Records Division of the
Central Office, Bureau of Lands or of District Land Office No. 7, which are the
proper official custodian of such records";</blockquote>

<blockquote>d) <span class="GramE">that</span> "the supposed affidavit of
waiver by <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> in favor of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>
Bautista was allegedly executed on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="7">July
 26, 1965</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 14-Meneses) and, although
it was mentioned in the said exhibit, there is no evidence presented as to its
actual existence";</blockquote>

<blockquote>e) that "as of 1962, the same area applied for by <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span>, allegedly consisting of 300 sq. m. then, was
already the subject of litigation between the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>,
on one hand, and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lonrenzo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lanuzo</span>, on the other
hand" (Civil Case No. B-350, <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">accion</i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span></i> although the area involved had increased by
accretion to 859 sq. m. by that time [Exhibits E to E-2]):</blockquote>

<blockquote>f) that "the same land applied for by <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span>
was within ** the private land survey conducted in 1964 ** for the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>, denominated as PSU-208327 (EXHIBIT D), thus,
it would appear that <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> had no legal or factual
basis in waiving her rights and interests in favor of Bautista on July 26.1965
(Exhibit 14-Meneses)";</blockquote>

<blockquote>g) that "neither could <span class="SpellE">Darum</span>, <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> brothers
ignore the existence of PSU-208327 as the said survey clearly appears on the
cadastral survey plan of <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Clemeno</span>,
plus the fact that the land was the subject of land registration
proceedings;"</blockquote>

<blockquote>h) that "in his Deed of Waiver and Transfer of Right', Bautista
declared that he had occupied the land in question since 1956 (Exhibit FF)
contrary to Exhibit 14-Meneses, which states that <span class="SpellE">Almeda's</span>
waiver to him was in 1965";</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">i</span>) that "when <span class="SpellE">Atty</span>
<span class="SpellE">Brion</span> (the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>'
attorney) went to ** <span class="SpellE">Darum</span> and also to the <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> brothers, these persons could not show or present
the requisite documents to support the issuance of Free Patents to <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>; ** (indeed) <span class="SpellE">Darum</span> and <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span> allegedly âreconstituted'
certain documents and it was only after the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>
had filed their complaint with the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Tanodbayan</i></span> and a prima facie case was found that the accused
came up with said reconstituted' documents to support their motion for
reconsideration in 1981 (Exhibit TT)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>
decision also pointed out ânumerous inconsistencies and contradictions ** in
the defense evidence," to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"(1) While Bautista declared in his waiver (Exhibit FF)that
the consideration for the transfer of his rights to <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> was love and affection and some monetary
obligation,â however during his testimony in the contempt case, he declared
that <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> owed him P12,000.00 (Exhibits 00-1 to
00-7), which <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> himself admitted by declaring
during the same proceedings that he had agreed to pay P12,000.00 to Bautista on
installments (Exhibits NN-1 to NN-3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Bautista declared in his Deed of Waiver, dated May 5, 1985
(Exhibit FF) that the area of the land transferred by him to <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> was 900 sq. m. while <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span>
claimed in her application that the area was 300 sq. m., and that she had
occupied said land since 1958 (Exhibit 12-Meneses). In Bautista's Application
for Permit dated <span class="SpellE">Feburary</span> 14, 1973 (Exhibit
27-Meneses), he stated that the area was still 300 sq. m., while in his
Affidavit dated May 12,1980, he stated that area is 318 sq. m.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) In the documents submitted by the defense and which were
notarized by accused Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>, some documents
were notarized by the latter as municipal mayor of Los <span class="SpellE">Banos</span>,
while others were notarized as a notary public, a circumstance which casts doubt
as to the genuineness of the allegedly 'reconstitutedâ supporting documents to
his brother <span class="SpellE">Pablito's</span> application.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) If it were true, as <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> and <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Bautista
contended, that the land subject of the free patent application had an arm of
900 sq. m. as of 1975 (Exhibit FF), ** no justification <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
(exists) since the private survey (PSU-208327) conducted at the behest of the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span> on May 16, 1984 showed that the total land area
which was added to the original <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span> property
by accretion was already 2,387 sq. m. (Exhibits D to D-3) In fact, in <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>' two applications
(Exhibits M and M-1), no area was mentioned of the two lots applied for.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5) While the defense vigorously insisted on their theory that the
land in question was held in occupancy by <span class="SpellE">Gliceria</span> <span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> from the Japanese Occupation up to 1965 when she
transferred her rights to <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Bautista, however,
there was no solid or substantial refutation of the prosecution's evidence that
Private Land Surveyor <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span>
findings, as set forth in the technical descriptions of Lots 1 and 2 of
PSU-208327, together with his Surveyor's Certificate, showed that as of 1964,
the adjoining owners of said land were the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>,
Santiago de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos and the Heirs of E. <span class="SpellE">Capinpin</span> (Exhibits D-1 to D-3)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their appeal (G.R. No. 71651) <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> and <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span>
Bautista raise the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>1. Whether or not private individuals like them "may be held
criminally liable for alleged violation of Section 3 (e) of R. A. 3019 under
which they are convicted anent the issuance of and granting of free patents
titles;"</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Whether or not they were convicted "on the basis of alleged
weakness of their evidence and not on the strength of the evidence of the
prosecution;"</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Whether or not their conviction was founded on "mere
suspicions and conjectures unsupported by positive proof;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the appellants in G.R. No. 71728, Pablo Silva,
<span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Cruz and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span>,
ascribe to the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>
the following errors, <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">viz</i></span>:</p>

<blockquote>1) â<span class="GramE">in</span> declaring "the existence of
conspiracy despite the fact that no evidence of its existence could be obtained
from the evidence of the prosecution **";</blockquote>

<blockquote>5) "<span class="GramE">in</span> not holding the evidence of
the prosecution insufficient to establish a moral certainty of guilt and in not
giving due weight and consideration to the evidence for the defense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It would seem quite obvious that such issues raised by <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> and Bautista in G.R. No. 71651 as whether or not
conviction was on the basis of alleged weakness of the defense evidence rather
than on the strength of the prosecution's proofs or was founded on mere
suspicions and conjectures; or the existence of conspiracy was inferred in the
absence of positive and convincing evidence; or the evidence on record does not
justify arrival at a verdict of guilt, are issues of fact, and not of law So,
too, such issues as are set up by Silva, Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span>
in G.R. No. 71728, to wit: whether or not there is sufficient evidence of
conspiracy among the accused; or Silva and Cruz acted truthfully and in utmost
good faith; or the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>
relied on the weakness of the defense rather than on the strength of the
evidence of the State; or the judgment of the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span> was unduly
influenced by the findings of the Civil Service Commission of grave misconduct
and neglect of duties as regards accused <span class="SpellE">Darum</span>; or
the evidence of the prosecution is insufficient to establish moral certainty of
guilt, are factual, not legal, issues. But it is axiomatic that in appeals to
this Court from the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>
only questions of law may be raised, not issues of fact (Sec. 7, PD 1606; Nunez
v. <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>
111 SCRA 433). Absent any grave abuse of discretion tainting the factual
findings of the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>,
and the record discloses no such grave abuse of discretion in the case at bar,
this Court is bound by those findings (<span class="SpellE">Calubaquib</span> v.
People, 117 SCRA 493).</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, a review of the record (Cesar vs. <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>,
134 SCRA 105, 121) satisfies this Court of the absence of error in the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sandiganbayan</i>'s</span>
factual findings. The appellantsâ claim of good faith and lack of awareness of
the registration proceedings initiated by the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>
and the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">accion</i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> <span class="SpellE">publiciana</span></i>
filed against <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>
and Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Lanuso</span> cannot be given credence. These
proceedings, apart from being widely known, could not possibly have eluded the
attention of the accused officers of the Bureau of Lands. By reason of their
positions which gave them easy access to all land surveys and records of
registration proceedings within their district, and the fact, particularly,
that they had to inquire into the history of the lands involved in the
applications of <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>,
and hence had to precisely examine those surveys and records, they could not
but learn, if they did not already know, the recorded and observable facts. The
appellants could not produce or exhibit to the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>'
counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Brion</span>, the papers relevant to <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> applications for
free patent. It was only after the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span> had
filed a complaint with the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Tanodbayan</i></span> that the accused public officers presented any of
the relevant documents; but even at this time, what was produced was not the
originals of <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span>'
free patent applications but only "reconstituted" copies thereof,
furthermore, the copies bore only the signature of the Land District Officer, <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span>, but not of the applicants, and equally as
significant, showed that no notice of the applications had been given to
adjoining land-owners. And, as earlier already stressed, the cadastral survey
made the basis for the issuance of free patents and titles to <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> had never been
approved by the Director of Lands as explicitly required by law. These
circumstances, considered conjointly with the other evidence of the
prosecution, and the infirmities in the documentary proofs of the appellants
and the serious inconsistencies and contradictions in their testimonial
declarations -- set forth by the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span> in its decision in no little detail, and of
the existence of which this Court is also satisfied - confirm the validity of
the factual findings of the <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Sandiganbayan</i></span>, inclusive of its <span class="SpellE">adjudgment</span>
that a conspiracy existed among the appellants as demonstrated by their
individual acts which though separately performed, all obviously conduced
towards the attainment of a common objective. Those findings will not therefore
be disturbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point sought to be made by appellants that private persons,
such as <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Bautista, can not be convicted of a
violation of Section 3[3] of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Law, its
application being limited only to public officers, cannot be conceded. Section
1 of the law makes clear the legislative intention to make application of the
statute extend both to public officers and private persons.</p>

<blockquote>"The policy of the Philippine government, in line with the
principle that a public office is a public trust is to repress certain acts of
public officers and private persons alike which constitute graft or corrupt
practices or which may lead thereto." <span class="GramE">(SEE also, Sec 4 [3rd
par.], PD 1606, as amended by PD 1861.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as the Solicitor General stresses, quite correctly --</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" *</span>* Section 4 [b] of R.A. 3019
punishes any private individual who knowingly induces a public Officer to
commit any offense defined in Section 3 of the said statute. Appellant <span class="SpellE">Meneses</span> desperately attempts to <span class="SpellE">exctricate</span>
himself by insisting that he cannot be punished for merely applying for a free
patent from the accused <span class="SpellE">Darum</span> and <span class="SpellE">Almendral</span>.
This would be true, were this the full extent of his participation, but as
circumstances show, he voluntarily participated in the fraud committed against
the <span class="SpellE">Quisumbings</span>. Indeed, it would be unlikely that
the public officers concerned would go to such lengths to grant such titles
were they not persuaded to do so by the appellants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having conspired and confederated with the accused public
officers, in the perpetration of acts designed towards the <span class="SpellE">obtention</span>
of pecuniary benefits or advantage, in violation of law, they must be deemed to
have consented to and adopted as their own, the offense of said public
officers; in a conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all (People v. <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>, 86 SCRA 370; see also U.S. v. Ponte, 20 Phil. 379;
