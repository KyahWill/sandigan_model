Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Cina</span>, charged and convicted for the violation
of Section 4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425 otherwise known as the
Dangerous Drugs Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case finds its origin in two separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
filed against the accused before the Regional Trial Court on <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the sale of prohibited <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">drugs in violation of Section 4, Art. II,
Rep. Act No. </span>6425, the information [Criminal Case No. 427-D] <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">against </span>appellant Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Cina</span> reads as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 9th day of April, 1987, in the Municipality of
<span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without having
been authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
sell and deliver to another person 4.33 grams of dried Marijuana fruiting tops,
which are prohibited drugs.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Contrary to law.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Record, p. 1.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other information [Criminal Case No. 428-D] charged him with
the possession of prohibited substances under Section 8, Art. II of Rep. Act
No. 6425, thus:</p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 9th day of April, 1987, in the Municipality of
<span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without having
been authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and

marijuana fruiting tops which are prohibited drugs.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Contrary to law.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Record, p. 2.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded "not guilty" to
both charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During trial, the accused
filed a motion to quash the information charging him with possession of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In support thereof, the accused invoked the ruling in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u>
<u>De</u> <u>Jesus</u> G.R. Nos. 71942-43, November 13, 1986, 145 SCRA 521,]
wherein the Court held that possession is inherent in the crime of selling
prohibited </span>drugs and therefore, the charges for both possession and
sale, when alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>have been
committed in one occasion, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">must not be
filed in separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding merit in the "Motion to
Quash" (which is actually a motion to dismiss having been filed after the
accused was arraigned and entered his plea), the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">dismissed </span>the charge of possession of
marijuana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Trial thereupon ensued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
found by the trial court, the evidence of the prosecution showed that:</p>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1987</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> in the evening, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Panaga</span> of the
Narcotics Command unit of the AFP posed as a buyer of two tea bags of marijuana
from herein accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The transaction took
place near the crossing of <st1:street><st1:address>Marcos Highway</st1:address></st1:street>

Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately after the exchange
of two (2) tea bags of marijuana for P20.00, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Panaga</span>
raised his right hand as a signal for Capt. (now Major) Edwin <span class="SpellE">Balongay</span> and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Contreras to apprehend said accused, which was accordingly done.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The body of the accused was thereupon
searched and Capt. <span class="SpellE">Balongay</span> recovered the P10.00 bill
and two (2) P5.00 bills which were marked "X5" for identification
purposes from the left front pocket of accused and five (5) tea bags of
marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The seven (7) tea bags are
found to be positive of marijuana by the PCCL [PC Crime Laboratory].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, Testimonies of Capt.

<blockquote>[RTC Decision, pp. 1-2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 16-17.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the facts of the case as alleged by the
defense were:</p>

<blockquote>On April 9, 1987 starting <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00</st1:time>
in the evening, he was the companion of a driver known to him only as
Bert.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was seated beside driver Bert
in front of the passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> plying the <span class="SpellE">Marikina-Pasig</span> route, giving change to passengers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time>
in the evening, the driver noticed the tire of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
as having not enough air and so they parked the jeep in the vulcanizing area of
the shop located at <st1:street><st1:address>Marcos Highway</st1:address></st1:street>
and <st1:address><st1:street>E. Rodriguez Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:city></st1:address>, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the driver alighted from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, an orange car stopped at the back of the jeep and
a man who he later found out to be Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Panaga</span>
boarded at the back of the jeep and asked him if the jeep is going to <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After he
explained [that] it will not because they will have the tire fixed, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Panaga</span> placed his forearm against his neck and told the <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span> of the driver Bert seated beside [the] accused in
front of the jeep not to move.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Three (3)
other companions of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Panaga</span> searched the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> with a flashlight until finally they found the 7
tea bags of marijuana at the back of the mirror of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused told the searchers that he was not
the owner of the jeep but he did not call driver Bert who he saw hiding behind
a post while the search was going on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the tea bags of marijuana were found, he and the <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span> of Bert [were] taken to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place> in
the orange car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were brought inside
the office of Capt. <span class="SpellE">Balongay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bert arrived soon thereafter. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Accused was then brought outside the office
while Bert and his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span> were left in said office
for a while but accused never saw the two again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused insists that he did not know anything
about the tea bags found in the jeep and that he never sold marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused admitted on the witness stand that he was under probation
at the time he was apprehended; that he first gave his name to the group of
Capt. <span class="SpellE">Balongay</span> as Ernesto Villanueva and then
admitted in <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> Jail where he was brought later,
that his real name is Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Cina</span>. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">(TSN, Hearings of September
13, and 27, 1988).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>[RTC Decision, p. 2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 17.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Giving credence to the case as established <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by the </span>prosecution, the trial court
rendered a decision finding the accused guilty as charged, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, the Court finds [the] accused ERNESTO
CINA y GASPAR @ "ERNESTO VILLANUEVA y GASPAR" GUILTY of the crime of
Violation of P.D. No. 6425, as amended, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs
Act of 1972, the prosecution having established his guilt beyond reasonable
doubt; and, pursuant to Section 4 of said Act, as amended by P.D. No. 1675,
hereby imposes upon him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a
fine of Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) pesos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Clerk of Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is

without delay.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the sole error assigned by appellant is that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> guilt was not established beyond reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon careful perusal of the memoranda of the parties and the
record of the case, this Court is convinced that Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Cina</span>
was indeed guilty of selling prohibited drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We affirm the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of his claim of innocence, appellant impugns the
credibility of the prosecution witnesses by putting at issue minor inconsistencies
in their testimonies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, appellant

prosecution witnesses to the prohibited substances </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">"marijuana </span><u>leaves</u>" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

identity of the substances brought to the crime laboratory for examination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>devoid
of merit.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We closely examined the testimonies of police officers Capt.
Edwin <span class="SpellE">Balongay</span>, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panaga</span> and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Contreras, and the forensic chemist <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
united and consistent in testifying that two tea bags were sold to the
poseur-buy<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">e</span>r, that five more were
later found in the left front pocket of the accused when he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was frisked by </span>the

<p class="BODY">Appellant belabors his theory on the improbability of his
committing the offense by arguing that it is contrary to human experience for a
drug pusher to sell to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>total stranger.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">It matters not that the buyer and the drug pusher are unfamiliar
with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crucial matter is
their agreement and the acts constituting the sale and delivery of the
prohibited substances [People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, G.R. No.
81520, <st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1989</st1:date>,
170 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">SCRA 497.] </span>In the present
case, although there were serious risks in selling marijuana to a virtual
stranger, apparently, the lure of profit overcame such consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, this Court finds that, as opposed to the clear and
straightforward manner in which the prosecution presented its case, the accused
dismally failed to support <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span>claim
of innocence and to present a meritorious defense <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">other than his flimsy denial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although appellant admitted that there were then several vendors in the
vicinity where </span>he was arrested, that he knew the owner of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, that he had often in the past ridden in said <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and even assisted the driver "Bert" in
collecting the fares from the passengers, and that the "<span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span>" of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
owner was seated beside him when he was unlawfully apprehended [TSN, September
13, 1988, pp. 5-7, 14-17,] curiously, he never made an effort to locate any one
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">them either to corroborate his claim
of innocence or to determine the true owner of the marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Such passivity <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">can hardly be expected of an innocent man, </span>more <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so where </span>his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">very life and liberty are at stake, and ultimately indicates pretended
innocence [People </span>v. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Considering all the foregoing, this Court finds that appellant's
guilt was, indeed, established with moral certainty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He must be penalized to the full extent of
the law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court is hereby <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">AFFIRMED <u>in</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.</p>
