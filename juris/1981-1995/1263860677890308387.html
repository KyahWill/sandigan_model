Capital Region, Branch 77 at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City finding
appellant RAMON MACUTO y TUYOGON guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating
Section 4, Article II of Rep. Act 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 as amended)
and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment, to pay a fine of
P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay the costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lower court acquitted his co-accused,
LUZVIMINDA LIBRE y DANTES of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information filed against the appellant alleged:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 22nd day of April, 1987, in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Court, </span>the
above-named accused, without any authority of law, conspiring together,
confederating with and mutually <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">helping
one another, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully
and feloniously sell and deliver one tea bag of dried marijuana fruiting tops,

said law." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

investigated this case; that when investigated and after having been appraised
of their constitutional rights, both accused chose to remain silent and
declined to give their statements; after his investigation, he referred the
matter to the Inquest Fiscal (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A); he further

<p class="BODY">The two accused, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Macuto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Libre</span> did not testify
in their defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two defense witnesses, Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Aventorado</span>
and Antonio Reyes <span class="GramE">merely</span> narrated how <span class="SpellE">Macuto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Libre</span> were
respectively picked up from a halo-halo stand and a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

for the Accused-Appellant)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised by the appell<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a</span>nt involves the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and
questions the weight given by the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>their testimonies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
have carefully reviewed the records of the case and are convinced that the
illegal sale of marijuana was committed by the appellant as narrated by the
prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no reason from the records why we should not apply the
rule that the findings of the trial court on the issue of credibility of the
witnessesâ testimonies are accorded great weight and respect on appeal because
the trial judge has the first-hand opportunity to examine and observe the
conduct and demeanor of the witnesses during the giving of their testimonies
(People v. Rodriguez, G.R. No. 81332 [April 25, 1989]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, G.R. No. 81520 [February 21, 1989]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Abonada</span>, G.R. No. 50041 [January 27, 1989]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Turla</span>, G.R. No. 70270 [November 11, 1988]; and People v. <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, 147 SCRA 404 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that the material inconsistency noted by
the trial court in the testimonies of Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Steeve</span></span><span class="GramE"> Moore and of Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Celestial constitutes a grave contradiction
sufficient to cast serious doubt on the truthfulness of the entire
prosecution's evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pat. Moore
testified that the marked money used in the buy-bust operation was recovered by
him from the person of the accused appellant during the arrest while, Pat.
Celestial narrated that it was taken from "Lucy", whom the appellant
earlier implicated but who was later on acquitted on the basis of the stated
discrepancy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The commission of the offense of illegal sale of marijuana
requires merely the consummation of the selling transaction whereby, as in this
case, the accused handed over the tea bag of marijuana upon the agreement with
the poseur buyer to exchange it for money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By itself, how the marked money was recovered is of no great
significance for us in establishing the guilt of the appellant (People v. Marco
Polo, 147 SCRA 551 [1977]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is
important is the fact that the poseur-buyer received the marijuana from the
appellant and that the contents were presented as evidence in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof of the transaction suffices.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The identity of the tea bag of marijuana which
constitutes the corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span> was established before
the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This being so, the
conflicting testimonies for the prosecution regarding the recovery of the
marked money did not discredit the whole of the prosecution evidence as being
inconclusive (People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The rule that the
testimony of a prosecution witness may be disbelieved in some facts but may be
believed in other facts is applicable to this case (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, 142 SCRA 427 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense evidence upon which the appellant relies,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the appellant could not
have been selling marijuana because he was merely buying halo-halo at the
alleged scene of the crime; and (2) that the appellant's co-accused (Lucy) was
suddenly arrested by three men while she was having snacks in a friend's house,
do not overthrow the positive identification made by the police officers that
he committed the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are
statements made by witnesses other than the appellant himself which the trial
court deemed not deserving of positive consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, if the appellant had meritorious
defenses, he should have himself taken the witness stand so he could have met
the charges squarely and refuted the accusations outright.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot now allege that no buy and sell
transaction occurred simply on the basis of the discredited testimony of his
witness that he was buying something else instead of selling prohibited drugs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also contends that it is unbelievable and contrary
to human experience for one to sell <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>prohibited
drug fearlessly to a stranger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
ruled in <u>People</u> <u>v</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Tejada</u></span>, <u>supra</u>, that "what matters is not
an existing familiarity between the buyer and seller but their agreement and
the acts constituting the sale and delivery of the marijuana leaves."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court does not find as credible the allegation that the
police officers framed-up the appellant through the buy-bust operation by
planting evidence for the purpose of extorting money and filing charges in
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This defense requires stronger
proof to overcome the finding of the trial court that the prosecution witnesses
were the ones who made truthful statements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Rualo</span>, 152 SCRA
635 [1987]).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since no such proofs
of ill-motives on the part of the policemen to extort money and to impute a
serious offense appear in the records, the presumption that there was regular
performance of public duty by public officers was not overthrown (People v.
Alvarez, G.R. No. 70446, January 31<span class="GramE">,1989</span>; People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, <u>supra</u>; People v. Rodriguez, <u>supra</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Underlying said presumption is the general
rule that credence is usually accorded to the testimonies of prosecution
witnesses who are law enforcers (People v. Claudio, 160 SCRA 646 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the reversal of the judgment of conviction now <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">being </span>sought for on the basis of the
pronouncement in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Ale</u> (145 SCRA 50 [1986]),
re:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the possibility of abuse in
anti-narcotics <span class="GramE">operations,</span> cannot be granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Ale</u>, there
were factual circumstances which showed that the entire prosecution evidence
was patently shaky.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, this
Court noted that the police informant who was also the poseur buyer in the
operation was not presented as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>His non-appearance in court was held
to be fatal to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">prosecution </span>of
Ale on the ground that evidence willfully suppressed is presumed to be adverse
if not produced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were material
contradictions between the two prosecution witnesses regarding, among others,
the identity of the poseur buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
Court in that case found unbelievable the testimonies of the two police
officers that they were able to discern the identity of the alleged marijuana
cigarettes while they were positioned about 10 to 15 meters away from the
alleged sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the testimony of
Ale that the reason for his arrest was because there was a time when one of the
arresting officers threatened to make <span class="GramE">a revenge</span> was
not contradicted by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
facts of the present case are radically different so the pronouncement in <u>People</u>
<u>v.</u> <u>Ale</u> does not apply.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following explanation made in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Agapito</u></span> 154 SCRA 694, 700 (1987) justifies our
conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>"In cases involving persons accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>being drug pushers or sellers, almost always the defense is
that the accused was framed by the apprehending police officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We realize the disastrous consequence on the
enforcement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of law and order, not to
mention the well-Â­being of society, if the courts, solely on the basis of the
policemen's alleged rotten reputation, accept in every instance this form of
defense which can be so easily fabricated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is precisely for this reason that the legal presumption that official
duty has been regularly <span class="GramE">performed,</span> exists."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">There is no question from the records
that the denials put forth by the appellant did not satisfactorily defeat the presumption
that the police officers regularly performed their duty, that the appellant was
positively identified as a seller of prohibited drugs and that the tea bag
taken from him actually contained marijuana fruiting tops.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find that the guilt of appellant MACUTO
has been established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the trial court in Civil Case
No. Q-51210 for the sale of prohibited drugs is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
