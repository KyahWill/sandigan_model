				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND FAUSTINO F. TUGADE AND W.
ESPIRITU TAGANAS, IN THEIR CAPACITY AS PRIVATE PROSECUTORS, PETITIONERS,
VS. HONORABLE ONOFRE A.
VILLALUZ, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE, CCC PASIG,
RIZAL, AND PEDRO BERROYA, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PLANA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Private respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> was
charged with murder before the then Circuit Criminal Court at <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> presided over by
former Judge <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>.
In the course of the trial, the prosecution presented all its witnesses except
two vital ones (Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Gon­zaga</span> and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Gadiar</span>) for the reason that they could not be located
despite the combined efforts of national and local law enforcement agencies to
do so for the pur­pose of executing the orders of arrest issued by the trial
court to compel them to appear and testify.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the two witnesses could not be found, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Ver</span>, the attending stenographer during the preliminary
investigation of <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> before the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office, was
presented to establish the authenticity of the transcripts of stenographic
notes of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gadiar</span> taken by question and answer, in­cluding their
extensive cross-examination by <span class="SpellE">Berroya's</span> counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the prosecution offered the trans­cripts in evidence,
but the same was rejected as hearsay by the respondent judge, although on
reconsideration they were admitted as part of the testimony of stenog­rapher <span class="SpellE">Ver</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the said ruling, the present petition was filed praying for
an order to annul the ruling of the trial court and commanding it to admit the
above transcripts not merely as part of the testimony of stenographer <span class="SpellE">Ver</span>, but as "testimony at a former trial"
pursuant to Section 41, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court. </p>

<p class="BODY">As the accused in a criminal case has the right of confrontation,
the witnesses against him must be produced to testify, subject to
cross-examination. This right however is not absolute. For it is generally re­cognized
that it is sometimes impossible to produce again a witness who has already
testified in a previous proceeding, as when the witness has died or is
otherwise unavailable, in which event, his previous testimony in its entirety
is made admissible as a distinct piece of evidence, as an exception to the
hearsay rule, parti­cularly where the party against whom the evidence is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">offered </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">had</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the opportunity to
cross-examine the witness who gave the testimony. (See 29 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 2d 807-809.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for the exception has been aptly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">expressed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Because such testimony has been de­livered under the sanction
of an oath and subject to the right of the adverse party to cross-examine the
witness giving it, it is not open to the objections ordinarily urged against
hearsay evidence. It is admitted on the principle that it is the best <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of which the case admits. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The real basis for the admission of testimony given by a
witness at a former trial is to prevent the miscarriage of justice <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">where the circumstances of the case have made
it unreasonable and unfair to exclude the testimony." (Ibid.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The legal provision invoked by petitioners reads:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Testimony at a former trial</u>. - The testimony of a
witness deceased or out of the Philippines, or unable to testify, given in a
former case between the same parties, relating <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to the same matter, the adverse party having had an opportunity to
cross-examine him, may be given in evidence." (Rules of Court, Rule 130,
Section 41.)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">More specific however is the rule prescribed in Rule 115, Section
1 (f) of the Rules of Court in respect of the admissibility in evidence in a
criminal case of the previous testimony of unavailable witnesses.</p>

<blockquote>"... Where the testimony of a witness for the prosecution has
previously been taken down by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">question </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">nd ans</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">wer </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">i</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">n the p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">r</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">esence of the defendant
or his attorney, the defense having had an opportunity to cross examine the
witness, the testimony or deposition of the latter may be read, upon
satisfactory proof to the court that he is dead or incapacitated to testify, or
can not with due diligence be found in the Philippines."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above provision used to be a part of paragraph 5 of Section
15 of General Orders No. 58. Commenting thereon, this Court had occasion to
note that "this provision does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not
refer to testimony taken </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a civil case, where the accused was one of
the parties, but to the </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">preliminary
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in</span>vestigation</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> or prior trial </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of the criminal case </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">which such deposition is o</span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">ffered</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">." (<span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Jugo</span> &amp; Martinez,
61 Phil. 374 at 379. Emphasis supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is no question that <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Gadiar</span> gave their testimony in the preliminary
investigation of <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> precisely for the same crime
for which he is now on trial; that the said testimony was taken by question and
answer in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Berroya</span> or his counsel;
that the defense had the opportunity and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in
fact actually cross-examined the said <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gadiar</span> extensively when they testified at the said preliminary
investigation; and that the said witnesses could not be found and arrested
despite the combined efforts of national and local law enforcement agencies,
including the NBI and the Philippine Constabulary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the given facts and the law, the transcripts of the previous
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gadiar</span>
are clearly admissible and should have been admitted in evidence as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">such.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of Toledo vs. People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">(85 SCRA </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">355), </span>where
this Court rejected the admission in evidence in a cri­minal case (murder) of
the testimony of a witness in the preliminary investigation of the same murder
charge in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office, is not applicable. For
there, the witness was available; he merely ignored the sub­poenas seeking his
appearance. And the trial court did not issue an order for his arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted. The assailed ruling of
the trial court is set aside and the said court is hereby ordered to admit in
evidence the trans­cripts of the testimony of Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>
and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Gadiar</span>. Costs against private respondent.</p>
