were accused of rape with serious illegal detention in the Regional Trial Court

<p class="2Q">'That on or about January 17, 1985, in the City of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>, Philippines, and within the juris­diction of this
Honorable Court, accused Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> conspiring and
confederating with his common-law wife, <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously and by means of force and intimidation have carnal knowledge with
one Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span>, a minor and who was working as <span class="SpellE">househelper</span> of the said accused; that thereafter, in order
to prevent the said Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> from reporting to the
proper authorities, detained and deprived her of her liberty far more than five
(5) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">days.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Later, on motion of the City Fiscal, the trial court
dismissed the case against <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> on May 23, 1985 on the ground that there was no
prima facie case against her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case
proceeded with respect to Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> who pleaded not
guilty to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>charge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Trial was thereafter held.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution <span class="GramE">versions is</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">as </span>follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The offended party, Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span>,
was <span class="SpellE">househelper</span> of the accused-appellant, Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>, and the latter's common-law wife, <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the evening of January 17, 1985, <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> made Arlene drink
half a glass of <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> <span class="SpellE">Rhum</span>,
as a result of which she felt drowsy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She therefore went to bed, but as she was about to fall asleep, somebody
knocked on the door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she opened it,
she saw the accused-appellant Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> had a
knife and threatened to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">kill </span>her
if she shouted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He pushed her to the
floor, placed himself on top of her, tore her blouse and fondled her
breasts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then pulled up her skirt,
kissed her and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pulled </span>down her
underwear and inserted his finger into her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arlene said she lost con­sciousness and when
she came to, she felt some pain and found her blanket stained with blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused, <span class="GramE">who</span> was
still in the room; gave her money and warned her not to tell anybody about the
incident, or he would kill her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The next day, Arlene told <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span>
about the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span>
told her not to tell anybody and asked her to stay, but as she insisted on
going home, <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> slapped her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> locked her
inside a room whose only window was closed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to Arlene, the ground below was muddy and there were many
broken glasses, making it dangerous for her to jump to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the accused and <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span>
guarded her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arlene said she was not
allowed to go out, except to go to the toilet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, as she refused to eat, she became weak and so, on January 23,
1985, after five days of detention, the accused-appellant finally released
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">According<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>Arlene, she stayed at the <span class="SpellE">Cristan</span> Commercial until January 29, 1985, when she saw her
aunt, <span class="SpellE">Saturnina</span> <span class="SpellE">Dagting</span>,
passing by and called her to tell her what had happened to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At 7:00 in the evening of that day, she was
taken by her mother and her aunt to the police station where she reported the
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later she was examined by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Carmina</span> <span class="SpellE">Barte</span>, who found that the
hymen had healed lacerations at 1.4 and <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6
 o'clock</st1:time> positions, and that such lacerations could have been caused
from one week to one year before.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the defense presented evidence to show
that Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> and the accused-appellant were
lovers and that Arlene complained to the police only because her relationship
with the accused-appellant had been discovered by the latter's common-law wife,
<span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>, and that it
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is<i> </i></span>not true that Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> had been detained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to the accused-appellant, Arlene and he became lovers in
September, 1984 and that they first had sexual intercourse on September 20,
1984, after which he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">said<i> </i></span>he
found that Arlene was no longer a virgin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused-appellant said he wanted to go to bed with Arlene on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">January </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">17, </span>1985 but it was Arlene's menstrual period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">him, </span>in the evening of January 19, 1985, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">as<i> </i></span>they were about to have sex, his common-law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">wife,<i> </i></span><span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span>,
suddenly came home from the <span class="SpellE">Molave</span> Disco House, where
she was an entertainer and noticed that Dick was perspiring.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This prompted her to go to the room of
Arlene, where she found her completely naked under the blanket.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Arlene denied having an affair with the accused-appellant but
the latter admitted that he and Arlene were lovers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On January 20, 1985, <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span>
drove the accused-appellant out of the house, but kept Arlene because she
needed her to look after their children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> finally dismissed Arlene on January
23, 1985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defense also presented Juliet Pasco, who said that twice,
on January 19, 1985 and January 20, 1985, she and<i> </i>Arlene and a certain <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Caloy</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>went to a place called <span class="SpellE">Abuno</span> to gather young coconuts and, on January 21, they
went to the Big Dipper Restaurant where they had beer, with Arlene paying the
bill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the purpose of her
testimony was to show <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">that </span>Arlene
was under no restraint at a time when she claimed she was detained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This witness said that on January 22, 1985
she accompanied Arlene to <span class="SpellE">Kanaway</span> to see <span class="GramE">a</span> herb doctor who found her to be pregnant and prescribed a
drink, (‘<span class="SpellE">camias</span>’) which made Arlene menstruate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On January 23, 1985 she said, Arlene
transferred to the <span class="SpellE">Cristan</span> Commercial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On October 7, 1985 the trial court rendered judgment
dismissing the rape charge on the ground that the offended party had not filed
a complaint, but finding the accused-appellant guilty of serious illegal
detention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the trial court's decision states:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In view of the foregoing, considering that the prosecution failed
to present a signed complaint of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">offended
party </span>the case of rape against the accused is hereby dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, with regards to the crime of serious
illegal detention, the accused is hereby sentenced after consider­ing the <span class="SpellE">indetermine</span> sentence law and there being <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">no </span>mitigating nor aggravating
circumstance, to suffer a<i> </i>penalty of from 12 years<i> </i>and 1 day of

the information against him was filed by the City Fiscal without giving him the
right to be heard in a preliminary investigation and that his motion for rein­vestigation
was summarily denied by the trial court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2<span class="GramE">)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That</span> the evidence
does not support the finding that he detained the offended party Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> from January 17 to January 23, 1985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) That since the
information was for the complex crime of rape with serious illegal detention,
it was error for the trial court to split the crime into two separate offenses
of rape and serious illegal detention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We shall deal with these contentions in their order.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">"<u>First</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The record shows that on March 6, 1985
the accused-appellant, with the assistance of counsel, filed a written waiver
of the 'right to the Second Stage of Preliminary Investigation' with the
Municipal Trial Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
case was remanded to the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office for the
filing of the corresponding information in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>Regional Trial Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Rec. pp. 11-12) Nonetheless, a reinvestigation was conducted by the
City Fiscal which on April 25, 1985 recommended the dismissal of the case with
respect to <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of this recommendation, the
trial court ordered the case against <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is, therefore, no basis for the accused-appellant's claim that he
was denied the right to a preli­minary investigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, it appears that on May 24, 1985, the accused-appellant
pleaded to the charge and took no further step to raise the question of denial
of the right to preliminary investigation either to this Court or to the
Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he entered into
trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He thus waived whatever right he
might have to preliminary investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

appellant argues that, therefore, it was not he who detained Arlene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant also cites the
testimony of Arlene that ‘He (the accused-appellant) usually went out during
the evening' (<u>Id</u>. p. 13) to show that he could not have kept watch over
her during her detention.</blockquote>

evening,' she was answering the question of the trial court as to the work of
the accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was not

That the accused-appellant was allegedly driven out of his house on January 20,
1985 was his own testimony (TSN, p. 6, September 19, 1985) and that of his
wife, <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> (TSN, p. 21, Aug. 16, 1985).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As far as the prosecution is concerned, Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> was not driven out of their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the offended party testified
that she could not leave the house of the accused-appellant because the latter
and his wife were guarding her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nor is there merit in the claim of the accused-appellant that
the trial court relied, on the weakness and supposed inconsis­tencies of the
defense evidence rather than the strength of the prosecution evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In finding the accused-appellant guilty, the trial
court stated:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">'The </span>prosecution
presented sufficient proof showing that Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span>
was raped by the accused Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> on January 17,
1985 and detained up to January 23, 1985 but had to allow her to leave the
house because by then Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> was not eating
anymore and was be­coming weak presumably because of shock suffered by
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused denied having raped
Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> and claimed that he did not even have
sexual intercourse with her on January 17, 1985 because Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> was menstruating and had sexual intercourse only on
January 19, 1985 and that was the date when they were discovered by his common
law wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also claims that Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> had been his sweetheart since September 15, 1984 and
they had sexual intercourse for several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">finds </span>that
the testimonies of the witnesses for the accused to be incredible and
contradictory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused claims that
he did not have sexual intercourse with Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span>
on January 17, 1985 because the latter was menstruating but the witness for the
accused Juliet Pasco testified that on January 22, 1985 they went to see <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>quack doctor because of the delayed
menstruation of Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> and it was only after
Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> drank, '<span class="SpellE">camias</span>'
on January 22, 1985 that her menstruation came.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>,
the common-law wife of Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>, she discovered
Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> and the accused had sexual intercourse on
January 19, 1985 when she went home from her work as a hostess in the <span class="SpellE">Molave</span> Disco House and she confronted Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> at 9:00 o'clock in the morning and that she did not
dismiss, Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> until January 23, 1985 because
there was no one who could take care of her children in the house if she would
drive her away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet the witness Juliet
Pasco testi­fied that on January 19, 1985 they went on an excursion to <span class="SpellE">Abuno</span> to eat young coconuts, going back there again on
January 20 to get coconuts which were eaten by Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>;
that on January 21, 1985 they went drinking beer at the Big Dipper at 7:00
o'clock in the evening and stayed for two hours; that on January 22, 1985 they
went to <span class="SpellE">Kanaway</span> to consult a quack doctor about the
condition of Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly this is in conflict with the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span>
who claimed that she confronted Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> regarding
her relationship with Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> on January 20, 1985
and would not dismiss Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> because she needed
her to watch her children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is true
that Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> was confronted regarding her illicit
relationship with Dick <span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> on January 19, 1985 she
would not have gone gallivanting to <span class="SpellE">Abuno</span> with the
witness Juliet Pasco going back there again on January 20, 1985 and then on
January 21, going out to drink.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
claim of <span class="SpellE">Joselyn</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ocapan</span> that she did not dismiss immediately
Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> because she needed her to watch her
children were true, then Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> could not have
gone to <span class="SpellE">Abuno</span> on January 19 and 20 and go out again
in the evening of January 21 and 22 with Juliet Pasco as she would be watching
the children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only did the

</span>According to him Arlene <span class="SpellE">Yupo</span> filed this case
against him in order to save her honor and in order that she would not be put
to shame and <span class="SpellE">embarassment</span> because their relationship
