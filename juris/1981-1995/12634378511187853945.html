				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The case of <i>Veloso v. Department of Labor and Employment</i><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>postulates that the law looks with disfavor upon quitclaims and releases by
employees who are inveigled or pressured into signing them by unscrupulous
employers seeking to evade their legal responsibilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there are legitimate waivers that represent a
voluntary settlement of laborer's claims that should be respected by the courts
as the law between the parties.  And
while in a dispute between management and labor the latter's rights are always
extended protection by the State, the picture changes completely where labor no
longer recognizes honor and a sense of commitment in solemn agreements.  This is a case in point.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners were regular employees of private respondent Orient
Marine and Fishing Resources, Inc., when they were dismissed on the ground of
retrenchment.  Contesting the legality
of their retrenchment, petitioners lodged separate complaints for illegal
dismissal and unfair labor practice with prayer for reinstatement and back
wages before the Regional Arbitration Branch No. 6 in Bacolod City.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated 4 March 1991, Labor Arbiter Buenaventura C.
Cordova, Jr., dismissed the complaints but ordered respondent Orient Marine and
Fishing Resources, Inc., to pay petitioners P4,005.00 each or the total amount
of P40,050.00 as separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unsatisfied, petitioners appealed to the National Labor Relations
Commission.  Pending appeal
(specifically on 7 May 1991, 3 June 1991 and 9 July 1991),<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioners executed separate affidavits stating, among others, their intention
to withdraw their appeal since they had already received the separation pay
decreed in the 4 March 1991 decision of Labor Arbiter Cordova, Jr.  Said affidavits were subscribed and sworn to
before Labor Arbiter Cordova, Jr., after the latter had explained to
petitioners the legal consequences of their action.  These affidavits were not, however, submitted to<span style=""> </span>the NLRC.  In other words, for some inexplicable reason, neither petitioners
nor private respondent brought to the attention of the Labor Tribunal the
crucial fact that they had already amicably settled their dispute and that
petitioners had been given their severance pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unaware of the joint affidavits, the NLRC rendered a decision on
16 July 1991 in favor of petitioners.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent Orient Marine and Fishing Resources, Inc., was ordered to
reinstate petitioners and to pay their full back wages which should in no case
exceed three (3) years.  In due time, an
"Entry of Judgment" was issued to the effect that the aforementioned
decision "has on August 12,1991 (become) final and executory."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners moved for execution which private respondent opposed
on the ground that the 16 July 1991 decision "has been rendered moot and
academic in view of the fact that the (petitioners) have already claimed their
separation pay in<span style=""> </span>conformity
with the decision (dated March 4, 1991) <span style="">of
</span>Labor Arbiter Cordova."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 January 1992, Labor Arbiter Cesar D. Sideno denied
petitioners' motion for execution and considered the cases closed and
terminated by reason of the settlement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners went up to the NLRC, this time questioning the 7 J<span style="">a</span>nuary 1992 order.  In its resolution of 14 July 1992, the NLRC
nullified the aforesaid order and directed Labor Arbiter Sideno " to issue
a writ of execution enforcing the decision x x x promulgated on July 16,
1992."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
But on motion for reconsideration by private respondent, the NLRC, in its
resolution of 28 September 1992, reversed itself and reinstated the 7 January
1992 order of Labor Arbiter Sideno.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC held that the dismissed employees were deemed to have
accepted the <span style="">4 </span>March 1991
decision of the Labor Arbiter because they voluntarily received their award as
directed therein.  Consequently, its
decision and resolution of 16 July 1991 and 14 July 1992 respectively became
moot and academic since the 4 March 1991 decision had been fully satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration having been denied on 19 November 1992,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioners sought the instant recourse contending that the NLRC committed
grave abuse of discretion in declaring that its decision and resolution of 16 <span style="">July </span>1991 and 14 July 1992
respectively have become moot.  Petitioners contend that the 16 July 1991 <span style="">decision was </span>already final and executory and could no longer be
set aside.  They also denounced their
"joint affidavits" pending appeal as violative of the constitutional
provisions guaranteeing protection to labor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No </span>grave abuse of
discretion can be imputed to the NLRC.  Necessarily, the petition must fail for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even as far back as 1923, the Court has acknowledged the binding
effect of agreements and compromises between the parties.  Thus we declared in <i><span style="">McCarthy v. Barber Steamship Lines</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> -<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<blockquote>Hence it is a general rule in this country that compromises are to
be favored, without regard to the nature of the controversy compromised x <span style="">x x x </span>and if a settlement be made x x x
free from fraud or mistake, whereby there is a surrender or satisfaction, in
whole or in part, of a claim upon one side in exchange for or in consideration
of a surrender or satisfaction of a claim in whole or in part, or of something
of value, upon the other, however baseless may<i> </i>be the claim upon either
side or harsh the terms as to either of the parties, the other cannot
successfully impeach the agreement in a court of justice x x x <span style="">x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the Labor Code recognizes the conclusiveness of
compromise settlements as a means to end labor dispute.  Art. 227 provides that "(a)ny
compromise settlement, including those involving labor standard laws,
voluntarily agreed upon by the parties with the assistance <span style="">of </span>the Bureau or the regional office
of the Department of Labor, shall be final and binding upon the parties.  The National Labor Relations Commission or
any court shall not assume jurisdiction over issues involved therein except in
case of non?compliance thereof or if there is <i><span style="">prima facie </span></i>evidence that the settlement was obtained
through fraud, misrepresentation or coercion."</p>

<p class="BODY">In a suppletory manner, Art. 2037 of the Civil Code states that
"(a) <span style="">compromise </span>has upon
the parties the effect and authority of <i><span style="">res judicata </span></i>x x x" and this is true even if the
compromise is not judicially approved.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, when the NLRC rendered its decision on 16 July 1991
ordering reinstatement and back wages for petitioners, it unknowingly
adjudicated a case which, for all intents and purposes, had already been closed
and terminated by the parties themselves when they agreed on a settlement.  This is the clear import of the rule that
compromises and settlements have the effect and conclusiveness of res judicata
upon the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, we are appalled at the <i><span style="">volte-face </span></i>and flagrant opportunism of petitioners.  As adverted to earlier, the separate <span style="">affidavits </span>representing the intention
of petitioners to withdraw their appeal from the NLRC since they have been
recompensed were voluntarily and knowingly made in the presence of Labor
Arbiter Cordova, Jr., who rendered the award in their favor.  The so-called "economic difficulties
and financial crises" allegedly confronting petitioners prior to their
separate affidavits is not an acceptable ground to annul the agreements since
it has not been convincingly established that petitioners were forced to
execute them.  In fact the alleged
violation of their constitutional rights should not even be dignified at all
with a corresponding rebuttal since the present petition is nothing but an
obvious ploy on the part of petitioners to backtrack on their undertaking,
especially after the labor tribunal has unwittingly ruled, although it
ultimately reversed itself, that they were entitled to reinstatement and a
higher monetary award.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <i><span style="">Periquet
v. National Labor Relations</span> </i><i><span style="">Commission</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> </span></i>capsulizes the current doctrinal
policy of the Court and it would be well for the parties contemplating
settlements to bear this in mind -</p>

<blockquote>Not all waivers and quitclaims are invalid as against public
policy.  If the agreement was
voluntarily entered into and represents a reasonable settlement, it is binding
on the parties and may not later be disowned simply because of a change of
mind.  It is only where there is clear
proof that the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person, or
the terms of settlement are unconscionable on its face, that the law will step
in to annul the questionable transaction.  But where it is shown that the person making the waiver did so voluntarily,
with full understanding of what he was doing, and the consideration for the
quitclaim is credible and reasonable, the transaction must be recognized as a
valid and binding undertaking.</blockquote>
