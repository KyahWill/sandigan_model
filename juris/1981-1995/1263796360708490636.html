				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">What at bottom petitioners seek in the appellate proceedings at
bar is that, by way of exception to the firmly established rule that the
conclusions of fact of the Court of Appeals are final and conclusive even on
this Court, the factual findings of that Court set out in the judgment rendered
against them<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
be reviewed and revised by this Court, on the ground that said findings are
tainted by grave abuse of discretion, being contrary to the evidence on record
as well as in conflict with the findings of the Trial Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conflicting claims over the ownership of valuable real properties<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
are asserted by the relatives of Juan <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span>, who
have been locked in legal combat for almost three and a half decades now.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Title to those properties stands solely in
the names of the spouses Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Sydeco-Tayengco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> being one among Juan's four daughters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1953, she and her husband were made
defendants in the action for recovery of the properties in question by her
mother Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span> and her sisters Mary <span class="SpellE">Sydeco-Tayengco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sydeco-Hautea</span>, with the heirs of Rosario <span class="SpellE">Sydeco-Militante</span>, who had died in 1945, being later <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as additional plaintiffs by an amendment of the
complaint.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The suit was grounded on the plaintiffs' (herein petitioners') theory that
defendant Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span> was a mere trustee of the
properties, the equitable title thereto pertaining to Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span>
and her children in co-ownership, because the capital used for their
acquisition came from the so-called "<span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span>
common fund" -- the wealth amassed, petitioners claim, by the <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span> family over the years from their textile business
(the "<span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span> Store") opened in 1933 with
the sum of P10,000 allegedly left in trust by Juan <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span>
for his heirs shortly before his death in 1927.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Traversing the material allegations of the complaint, the spouses
answered that the properties in dispute were acquired with their exclusive
funds, i.e., with the income earned by Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span>,
as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the profits the
spouses realized from having invested their capital in constructing and
operating a new textile store where the old one, which was gutted by fire during
World War II, used to stand.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Twenty-six years of trial ensued, the litigants engaging in a
battle of evidence as to the origin and ownership of the funds with which the
lands were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">acquired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On May 27, 1979, the Trial Court rendered
judgment</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> declaring Mary, <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>,

of the properties and prescribing the corresponding relief such as partition of
the properties and the rendering of an accounting by defendant Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span>, upon the finding that "the funds used ** are
traceable to the profits or income derived from the starting sum of P10,000.00

sufficient to show specifically that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
1927, observing a Chinese custom, Juan entrusted P10,000 to his eldest son, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, to be used for the benefit of his (Juan's) wife

1933, with this "common fund" as capital, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>

members participated in the operation of the store from its establishment in 1933;</p>

<p class="BODY">(4)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>business prospered,
and although the store closed down at the outbreak of World War II, with the
proceeds from the sale of the stocks which survived the war, the <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span> store was re-opened after liberation; and</p>

<p class="BODY">(5)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">the</span>
properties subject of the litigation were bought at the time that the business
was under the management of Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span>, who used
the profits to make the purchases in behalf of the <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span>
family.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision was appealed by the defendants to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The eight assigned errors,
according to the Appellate Court, in substance raised the factual issues of (1)
whether a common fund was constituted by Juan <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span>
for the benefit of his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">heirs; (2)
whether the money used by the defendants-spouses in the acquisition of the subject
properties came from the alleged common fund; and (3) whether there was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">fiduciary or trust relationship between Jose
and the plaintiffs insofar as those properties are concerned.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These issues were resolved against the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
now petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Though underscoring
particularly the absence of convincing and reliable evidence to prove the
establishment of the common fund,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the Appellate Court also noted that even if such fact be assumed as true, the
palpable insufficiency of proofs precluded the Court from presuming that the
store's starting capital in 1933 came from this fund, or that the same money
was used to re-open the store when <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> migrated
to Manila in 1936,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
thereby disposing of the contention that the funds left by Juan and the capital
expended by the spouses for the acquisition of the lands in the 1940's were
linked in any way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather, the Court
found that the evidence preponderated to establish that Juan <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span> was insolvent in the few years preceding his death;
that even if Juan had the means to entrust P10,000 to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
in 1927, the latter only ventured into the retail business in 1933 after an
"unexplained gap of six years" during which the fate of the sum given
him was uncertain; that <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> left for Manila in
1936 and brought with him the stocks of the store he had opened; that <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> then
entered into a partnership and resumed business operations, but this
association was dissolved in 1942 when <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>
married Jose <span class="SpellE">Hautea</span> against <span class="SpellE">Salvacion's</span>
wishes, resulting in the complete severance thereafter of their personal ties;
that the building housing the store burned down during World War II, but after
liberation, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span> built on the same
lot a new structure where they opened their own store; that the spouses
acquired the real properties in controversy with their exclusive capital, since
the common fund did not exist; and that assuming all the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">facts as alleged by the plaintiffs to be
true, their claim against the <span class="SpellE">Tayengcos</span> was barred by
prescription.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners, as has been said, have come to this Court
seeking the review of the factual findings upon which the Appellate Court's
judgment dismissing the complaint was made to rest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is charged that said court gravely abused
its discretion "in not applying the applicable provisions of law and in
not observing the settled jurisprudence (in resolving the appeal);"
"in arriving at a conclusion which is contrary to the facts and
circumstances of the case;" and "in not affirming the decision of the
trial court".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The denial of the petition is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset it must be stated that review of factual findings
of the Intermediate Appellate Court (now the Court of Appeals) is not a
function <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ordinarily undertaken by this
Court, the rule admitting only of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">few exceptions recognized in
decisional law.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> The principle is consistent with the Rules
of Court which categorically provide that a petition for review on </span><i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">must
raise "only questions of law" to be "distinctly set forth"
in the </span>petition.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Even then, the review sought will be denied if the questions raised are
"too unsubstantial to require consideration," or if the Court is not
convinced of the existence of "special and important reasons" to
warrant review.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Submitted for the consideration of this Court in the case at bar
are alleged questions of law, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">quo</span></u> having purportedly erred "in not applying the
applicable provisions of law and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:25.0pt">** </span>jurisprudence,"
"in arriving at a conclusion ** contrary to the facts and circumstances of
the case," and "in not affirming the decision of the trial
court"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
although the petitioners themselves admit at the close of their brief that the
ultimate question they seek to have this Court resolved is "whether or not
** the findings ** of the respondent ** Court are supported by substantial
evidence."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, to obtain a favorable judgment, the petitioners must inevitably
challenge the findings of fact of the Appellate Court, which findings are
generally binding on this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
respondents correctly point out the futility of denying that the case
essentially involves issues of fact, answers to which will have to depend upon
an examination of the record to test if the findings are borne out by the
evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
It is in cases like the one at bar, having for their objective the review of a
record consisting of several thick volumes of testimonial and documentary
evidence, where the Court is justified in refusing outright to exercise its
appellate jurisdiction, there being no cogent reason advanced to warrant such
undertaking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the vague and
general submissions of the petitioners as to the errors ascribed to the Court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> barely constitute persuasive arguments for the grant of review.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, the petitioners' averments of the Appellate Court
having gravely abused its discretion in arriving as it did at the assailed
factual findings are patently unfounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie's</span> testimony on the alleged
establishment of the common fund cannot be described as other than vague,
uncorroborated, and contradictory on several material points, as observed by
the Appellate Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such quality of
proof, on material points at that, renders it injudicious to take the facts
alleged as true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems rather
strange, for example, if indeed Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span> "was
present and saw the money delivered and counted" that there are no other
details contained in her testimony of the occasion -- or occasions, assuming
the money was released "little by little" over a period of years, as
Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span> had testified at one time -- when the fund was
constituted with Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span> as the lone witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing has been said, for example, of words
Juan and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> may have uttered at that time, or
the instructions specified by the father to the son as the money was handed
over, or Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie's</span> own participation in the incident,
if any.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span>
may have asserted that "it is Chinese custom and tradition usually that
father entrust (his properties) to the elder son"<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
but her bare statement, refuted as it is by the respondents, cannot be relied
upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>proof of that custom, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">or </span>proof that the custom obliged the
eldest son to share what was given with the ascendant's other heirs, or, most
importantly, as proof that Juan intended to abide by or to carry out the
custom, there being no other evidence from which such conclusion may be
drawn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also almost impossible to
ascertain whether (if at all) the fund was transferred to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano's</span>
custody as Juan was lying in his deathbed, or some three or four years
previously, or if certain amounts were delivered to <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
"from time to time" and not the entire sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>
at any particular instance, Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span> having <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> all these conflicting bits of information on the
witness stand.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not even clear if she was actually present when the purported covenant
between father and son was sealed, as she also testified at the trial that she
learned of the establishment of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">common
fund from Juan,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> then</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> later declared that the information came
from <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">her </span>husband.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Her testimony is seriously flawed by these inconsistencies and by its ambiguity
-- defects which cannot be overlooked, bearing <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>they do on the primary fact in dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the ownership by Juan of properties in
the years before his death is also put in doubt by Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie's</span>
very statements, she, also having, on one occasion declared or suggested that
her husband was insolvent at that time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court cannot, therefore, be said to have gravely
abused its discretion in finding <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>lack
of convincing and reliable evidence to establish the creation of the fund, a
fact on which the petitioners' cause is rooted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners make much of the fact that no witness was presented to
rebut Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie's</span> testimony, but such an omission does
not necessarily compel belief in what she has said as true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The burden of evidence was on the petitioners
to establish the facts upon which their action is premised; the petitioners
simply have failed to discharge this burden, and must therefore bear the
consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, contrary to the
petitioners' posture, the Appellate Court did pass upon and weigh Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie's</span> testimony, although it inaccurately said that her
statements, she having mentioned that she came to know of the common fund from
Juan, or from <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, constituted hearsay evidence
and were therefore inadmissible in evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While her testimony, because it was not objected to, became admissible,
the probative value to be accorded to it is an entirely different matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The admissibility of evidence should not be
confused with its weight; whether objected to or not, hearsay evidence has no
probative value.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
In any case, it cannot be doubted that her testimony was considered by the
Appellate Court in its judgment but was found by it to be flawed in other
respects.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the other facts in dispute, the Appellate Court correctly
weighed the evidence and found it insufficient to support the petitioners'
claim that the funds used by the <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span> spouses to
acquire the properties in dispute in 1942-49 are directly traceable to the
common fund, and its accretions, allegedly set up in 1927 or before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Too many gaps exist in their chronicle of
happenings during the intervening years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Too many events remain shrouded in obscurity due, largely, to the early
deaths of those who could competently testify on these material matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>, for
example, could have clarified what precise task his father had charged him with
in 1927, or with what funds he opened the store in 1933, or if he brought the
stocks of the <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span> store, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span> had
testified, when he left </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There thus appears to be ample
reason to decry the absence of reliable evidence from competent witnesses on

favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as no adequate proof
exists of facts constituting the basic premises of the petitioners' theory that
Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayengco</span> was a mere agent of the <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span> heirs when the purchases of the disputed lands were <span class="GramE">effected</span>, the issue of whether or not such a fiduciary
relationship existed must be resolved against the petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be emphasized at this point that the claim that the lands
are impressed with an implied trust is asserted to nullify Torrens Certificates
of Title which are meant to evidence the absolute title to the property of the
owners named therein, against the whole world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the present case, pitted against such titles are mere assertions of
the petitioners that they agreed to the purchases of the land with the common
fund, although the properties were to be placed in the <span class="SpellE">Tayengcos</span>'
names exclusively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As has been pointed
out, evidence of the establishment of the common fund is very <span class="SpellE">inadequarte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to
the alleged agreement between the members of the <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span>
family, at the time the properties were purchased, <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> were no longer on speaking terms,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Rosario was already dead while her husband Ramon <span class="SpellE">Militante</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Conchita's</span> husband Jose <span class="SpellE">Hautea</span>
were not informed of the purchases,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
and Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span> admitted knowing of the acquisitions but
could not even say whether <span class="SpellE">Conchita</span> agreed to them or
not because she (Cu <span class="SpellE">Bie</span>) "(had) not talked to
her (<span class="SpellE">Conchita</span>) about it".<a style="mso-footnote-id:

sales were known to the spouses, and subsequent transactions involving the
lands appear to have been decided upon and entered into by them only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, buildings and other improvements were
constructed on the lands, and to finance those undertakings, the <span class="SpellE">Tayengcos</span> executed real estate mortgages, without the other
<span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span> family members appearing to have had any
intervention in these matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
no evidence that the decision to sell other parcels of land was arrived at and
carried out by persons other than the spouses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Only the Jose <span class="SpellE">Tayengcos</span>, therefore, have been
shown to have<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> exercised acts of
ownership over the properties in question, which circumstance tends to
strengthen their contention that the lands are owned by them exclusively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that no grave abuse of discretion was committed by
the Court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">quo</span></u> in
having found the evidence adduced to be insufficient to prove the facts on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">which </span>the causes of action against the
respondents are grounded, the verdict must go against the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No need exists to delve into the issue of the
prescriptive period within which an action to enforce an implied trust must be
brought, the existence of such trust -- which is premised on the unproven claim
that a common fund was constituted for the <span class="SpellE">Sydeco</span>
