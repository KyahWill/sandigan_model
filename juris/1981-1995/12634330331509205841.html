				<BR><STRONG>NOCON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Subject of this appeal is the decision of the Regional Trial
Court, Branch 56, Lucena City, wherein appellant Edgardo Canela was found
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime penalized under Article II, Section
4 of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended by P.D. No. 1675, otherwise known as the
Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, under the information which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 17th day of May 1988, in the City of
Lucena, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
said accused, without authority of law, for and in consideration of P20.00,
sold and delivered, to another, that is, to one Sgt. Dominador Cruz, a PC
Narcom Agent of Camp Nakar, Lucena City, posing as buyer, dried marijuana
fruiting tops, weighing approximately 5 grams, in violation of the
aforementioned law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant pleaded "NOT GUILTY" to the offense
charged and, after trial, the court a quo rendered judgment against him, the
dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, by the evidence adduced, the Court finds Edgardo
Canela guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime penalized under Article II,
Section 4 of Republic Act 6425 as amended by P.D. No. 1675, otherwise known as
the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, and accordingly sentences him to reclusion
perpetua, and to pay a fine of not less than P20,000.00".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The People's version of the facts is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on an information that a certain Edgar was peddling
marijuana at the corner of Claro M. Recto St., Lucena City, a team of Narcotics
Command (hereinafter referred to as NARCOM) agents composed of Sgts. Dominador
Cruz, Elpidio Anasta, Ramoncito Yeban and Iluminado Evangelista was formed to
conduct a "buy-­bust" operation on May 17, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">A mission order was accordingly issued by Captain Rodolfo Basco
of the Quezon NARCOM wherein Sgt. Dominador Cruz was to act as a
poseur-buyer.  A dragnet was set up
where a team was deployed at different strategic places near the Supreme
Transit Terminal where the intended sale was to take place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Across the Supreme Transit terminal is a billiard hall where a
civilian informer contacted the accused and for a while the two conversed after
which accused-appellant approached the poseur-buyer.  The latter asked accused-appellant if he could buy two (2) tea
bags of marijuana.  Accused-appellant
left for a while and after about three (3) minutes, he (accused-appellant)
returned with the marijuana, gave the same to Sgt. Cruz and the latter gave him
two (2) marked ten peso bills.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Then a certain Sgt. Elpidio Anasta approached the two, searched the accused and
recovered from him the marked money paid by the poseur-buyer, a tea bag
containing marijuana, one stick of marijuana cigarette and rolling papers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant however, disputes the foregoing facts.  Instead, he stated that what transpired is
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 17, 1988, accused-appellant went to the billiard hall
fronting the Supreme Transit bus terminal along C.M. Recto in Lucena City for a
meeting with his business partner Antonio Guevarra, which had been scheduled
previously.  As accused-appellant
arrived early for the meeting, he sat on the long bench on the side of the
billiard hall where two persons were already seated to his right.</p>

<p class="BODY">  Shortly thereafter, a
purported civilian agent of the local NARCOM by the name of Bong Alday entered
the billiard hall and approached an unidentified person seated at the far end
of the bench.  Accused-appellant saw
Bong Alday handing folded money to the unidentified person who after receiving
the money, stood up and pulled something from his pocket.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
As he was about to hand it to Bong Alday, another purported NARCOM civilian
agent by the name of Ato Angeles, suddenly grabbed the right arm of the
unidentified person.  The latter
struggled to extricate himself and eventually got free and ran towards the rear
of the billiard hall along the path where the accused-appellant was.  As the unidentified person ran past the
latter, the former dropped the folded money and two (2) articles wrapped in a
plastic bag at or near the accused-appellant's feet, or approximately less than
a foot away.  The folded money and the
objects were picked up by Angeles who was then in pursuit of the two (2)
persons.  Not being able to catch up
with the two persons who fled, Bong Alday and Ato Angeles returned to the
billiard hall after twenty (20) minutes.  They approached accused-appellant and asked him if he knew the
identities of the two persons.  Accused-appellant answered in the negative.  Angered by the response, Angeles cursed him and said, "<i>Putang
ina mo, tatanggi ka pa ay kitang-kita ko na sa iyo ipinasa ang marijuana</i>."
Accused-appellant then reasoned to the agents that the marijuana was not passed
to him but instead dropped by the unidentified person, and that the same was
picked up by Angeles.  Irked by his
reasoning,  Angeles told
accused-appellant, "<i>Putang ina mo, magmamaang-maangan ka pa ay totoo
namang nagmamarijuana ka</i>.<i>  Pilosopo ka pa</i>".  At
this juncture, the NARCOM agent grabbed the accused-appellant by his left arm
and forced him out of the billiard hall.  Accused-appellant protested and maintained that he has not committed any
crime, but Angeles pulled his gun and threatened to shoot him if he will not go
along.  Out of fear, accused-appellant
went with Angeles to the local NARCOM Headquarters.  Upon arrival thereat, Angeles indorsed accused-appellant to Sgt.
Dominador Cruz, who then conferred with Angeles for about fifteen minutes.  Thereafter, Sgt. Cruz searched
accused-appellant, took his wallet and money amounting to P80.00 and
interrogated him as to identities and whereabouts of the persons who escaped the
NARCOM agents.  When accused-appellant
answered the questions propounded to him in the negative, Sgt. Cruz angrily
uttered the following remarks, "<i>Tarantado ka, huwag kang magbubulaan,
tutoo namang nagmamarijuana ka rin</i>." Sgt. Cruz continued interrogating
accused-appellant, and when the latter continued to answer the questions in the
negative, the former slapped him twice and left the room.  The following day, accused-appellant was
brought once again to the room of Sgt. Cruz and there he was told that he could
be released provided he can come up with the amount of P12,000.  Accused-appellant was not able to come up
with the said amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">After carefully reviewing the records of the case, We hold the
accused-appellant innocent.  He was made
the fall-guy for an unsuccessful NARCOM buy-bust operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conflicting and inconsistent testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses on material points, such as the formation of the team, the
composition of the team, on the presence of the civilian informer with the team,
the marked money used, time of the operation, on the conduct of the exchange,
the articles seized from accused-appellant, and the alleged target of the
buy-bust operation, attest to the weakness of the prosecution's case, and
thereby engendering doubt as to the guilt of the accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution relied heavily on the testimonies of P/Lt. Tita
Advincula, Sgt. Dominador Cruz, Sgt. Elpidio Anasta and Sgt. Rico Atienza.  While Sgt. Ramoncito Yeban was also
presented, the prosecution sought to strike-out his testimony from the record
on the pretext that he was a hostile witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
No order to strike-out Sgt. Yeban's testimony was however given by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the formation of the team, Sgt. Cruz testified that the team
for the buy-bust operation was organized because of a mission order issued by
Captain Roberto Basco.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This was contradicted by Sgt. Anasta, however, who testified that the team was
formed as a result of an information received by Sgt. Evangelista that a
certain Edgardo Canela is selling prohibited drugs at Claro M. Recto infront of
the Supreme Transit bus terminal.  No
mention was ever made on the alleged mission order.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the composition of the team, Sgt. Dominador Cruz testified
that the following NARCOM agents conducted the "buy-bust "
operation:  Sgts. Cruz, Evangelista,
Yeban, Anasta and Doctor,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
while Sgt. Elpidio Anasta testified on direct examination that the above-named
NARCOM agents with the exception of Sgt. Doctor conducted the operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
However, on cross?examination, Sgt. Anasta testified that aside from
those he mentioned, Sgt. Atienza was with them in the operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
He also testified that Sgt. Doctor remained in the office at the time the
buy-bust operation was conducted.  On
the other hand, Sgt. Rico Atienza testified that the NARCOM agents who
conducted the operation were Sgts. Evangelista, Cruz, Anasta and Yeban.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
At that time, he was the duty investigator and he stayed at the office while
the "buy-bust" operation was being conducted.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
As to Sgt. Doctor's participation, he testified on cross examination that Sgt.
Doctor was a member of the team, but stayed in the office.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Sgt. Doctor, however, denied that he is a member of the "buy-bust"
team; that he was not present at the time of the alleged "buy-bust"
operation; and that he stayed in his office for a while and only came to know
of the "buy-bust" operation on the following day, May 18, 1988.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the civilian informer who was with the team, Sgt. Cruz
testified on cross examination that their civilian informer was already in the
office in the morning of May 17, 1988 and who later accompanied the team in the
"buy-bust" operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
This was contradicted by Sgt. Anasta who maintained that no civilian informer
was with them at the time of the "buy-bust" operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the marked money used by the team, Sgt. Cruz testified that
the ten peso bills used in the operation came from their commanding officer,
Capt. Rodolfo Basco.  When he received
the money, there were no markings on it, but the serial number of the money was
recorded in the log book.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, Sgt. Atienza testified that the marked money was given by
Sgt. Evangelista to him which he initialed<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and then gave the marked money to Sgt. Cruz before the operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the time of operation, Sgt. Cruz testified that the
"buy-bust" operation took place at around 10:00 o'clock in the
morning.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
On cross examination, Sgt. Atienza testified that the "buy-bust"
operation took place at around "171430" hrs or 2:30 P.M., the time
stated in the booking sheet.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the conduct of the exchange, Sgt. Cruz said it was the
civilian informer who approached the accused-appellant.  He did not introduce the accused-appellant
to the informer because the latter left immediately after approaching the
accused-appellant. Sgt. Cruz asked the accused-appellant if he was selling
marijuana.  Instead of answering, the
accused-appellant then went back to the billiard hall and after three (3)
minutes, he came back with two (2) teabags of marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Contrary to Sgt. Cruz’ version, Sgt. Anasta testified that among the members of
the team present during the exchange, he was the nearest to Sgt. Cruz.  That at the time of exchange, Sgt. Cruz was
alone; that the accused-appellant approached Sgt. Cruz, who apparently had the
marijuana with him, because the accused-appellant never left the billiard hall
during the exchange.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the articles seized from the accused-appellant, Sgt. Anasta
stated during the direct examination, that he recovered from the right hand of
the accused-appellant the marked money, a teabag of marijuana, a stick of
cigarette and a rolling paper.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
However, on cross-examination Sgt. Anasta testified that what he recovered from
the accused-appellant were the marked money, two (2) teabags of marijuana, four
(4) rolling papers, and two (2) sticks of suspected marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Sgt. Atienza on the other hand testified that what Sgt. Anasta turned over to
him during the investigation were two (2) marked ten peso bills, a small tea
bag of marijuana and one stick of suspected marijuana cigarette.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the alleged identity of the subject target of the alleged
"buy-bust" operation, Sgt. Cruz testified that his commanding
officer, Capt. Rodolfo Basco ordered him to apprehend accused-appellant whom he
specifically identified by name.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Sgt. Yeban on the other hand, testified that it was upon the orders of Sgt.
Evangelista that they conducted a surveillance on accused-appellant, whom
Evangelista specifically identified by name.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Sgt. Anasta testified, however, that neither Sgt. Evangelista nor the alleged
informant gave a description of the alleged target/subject of the surveillance,
much less was the latter identified as accused-appellant.  He asserted that they were not even told
whether the subject/target was a male or female.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing inconsistencies on material points tend to show
that the accusations against the accused-appellant are fabricated.  These inconsistencies were never explained
by the prosecution.  Irreconcilable and
unexplained contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses cast
doubt on the culpability of the appellant and his guilt for the crime charged.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. Cruz could not have acted as poseur-buyer in the buy-bust
operation because at the time of the alleged operation, Sgt. Cruz was already
known to the accused-appellant as a NARCOM agent.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
It was only when accused-appellant was brought to the NARCOM headquar­ters that
he first saw Sgt. Cruz on that day.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed the conflicting and inconsistent testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses raise doubt as to whether a "buy-bust"
operation directed at accused?appellant was indeed conducted by the team
of Sgt. Evangelista.  No mission order
which was the basis for the formation of the team of Sgt. Evangelista was ever
presented, inspite of the reservation of the prosecution to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Its non-presentation raises a pre­sumption of its non-existence much less the
organiza­tion of a "buy-bust" team led by Sgt. Evangelista.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the NARCOM "blotter" wherein all appre­hensions
made by the Quezon Narcotics Command are en­tered and/or recorded and which
Sgt. Anasta promised to bring to the court, was never presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">The suspicion that there is no such evidence or if there is, its
presentation would not support the prosecution's case, is not far fetched.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this Court finds that the arresting officers had
violated accused-appellant's rights when they failed to inform of his rights as
mandated by the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <i>People v. Galit</i><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
laid down the guidelines to be observed by police officers in making an arrest,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At the time a person is arrested, it shall be the duty of the
arresting officer to inform him of the reason for the arrest and he must be
shown the warrant of arrest if any.  He
shall be informed of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to counsel,
and that any statement he might make could be used against him.  The person arrested shall have the right to
communicate with his lawyer, a relative or anyone he chooses by the most
expedient means by tele­phone if possible, or by letter or messenger.  It shall be the responsibility of the
arresting officer to see to it that this is accomplished.  No custodial investigation shall be conducted
unless it be in the pres­ence of counsel engaged by the person arrested, by any
person on his behalf, or appointed by the court upon petition either of the
detainee himself or by anyone on his behalf.  The right to counsel may be waived but the waiver shall not be valid
unless made with the assistance of counsel.  Any state­ment obtained in violation of the procedure herein laid down,
whether exculpatory or in­culpatory, in whole or in part, shall be in­admissible
in evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution gave more teeth to the foregoing principle and
further provided:</p>

<blockquote>"Any person under investigation for the com­mission of an
offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and
to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice.  If the person cannot afford the services of
counsel, he must be provided with one.  These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of
counsel."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>People vs. Nicandro,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court emphasized that the phrase "to be informed of his right to
remain silent and to . . . counsel", contemplates the transmission of
meaningful information rather than just the ceremonial and perfunctory
recitation of an abstract constitutional principle.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that accused-appellant was properly informed
of his constitutional rights.  While
Sgt. Atienza claimed that he informed the accused-appellant of his
constitutional rights when he prepared the booking sheet and arrest report, a
perusal of said document<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
failed to show that accused-appellant was informed of said rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">And this was eventually admitted by Sgt. Atienza on
cross-examination.  Not only did he not
inform accused-appellant of his rights, he also failed to ex­plain said rights
to him.  He simply made the accused read
the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Even when accused-appellant was made to sign on the ten-peso bills allegedly
confiscated from him in the buy-bust operation; he was only made to read his
constitutional rights.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Making accused-appellant read his constitutional rights is simply
not enough.  The prosecution must show
that accused-appellant <i>understood</i> what he read, and that he <i>understood</i>
the consequences of his waiver.</p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the arresting officers to follow established
procedure in dealing with persons they may have arrested engenders doubts as to
the veracity of their claim that they arrested accused-appellant after he had
tried to sell them marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">While this Court commends the efforts of law en­forcement
agencies who are engaged in the difficult and dangerous task of apprehending
and prosecuting drug-traffickers, it cannot also close its eyes nor be deaf to
the many reports of false arrests of innocent persons for extortion and
blackmail, and in some in­stances, to satisfy some hidden personal resentment
of the "informer" or law enforcer against the accused.  Courts should be vigilant and alert to recognize
trumped-up drug charges lest an innocent man, on the basis of planted evidence,
be made to suffer the unusu­ally severe penalties for drug offenses.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>
