this Court on <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1986</st1:date>,
enjoining the respondents from enforcing the questioned resolution of the
respondent Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues to be resolved in the instant case are whether or not
the employment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> was illegally
terminated by the petitioner; and whether or not the respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> is entitled to salaries corresponding to the
unexpired portion of his employment contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span>
was validly dismissed because the latter was still a probationary employee; and
that his dismissal was justified on the basis of his unsatisfactory performance
of his job during the probationary period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This contention has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 280 (formerly Article 281) of the Labor Code, as amended,

<p class="BODY">Petitioner admitted that respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span>

he was dismissed on <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the employment contract reveals
that although the period of employment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span>
is twelve (12) months, the contract period is renewable subject to future
agreement of the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is clear
from the employment contract that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span>
was hired by the company as a regular employee and not just a mere probationary

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The law is clear to the
effect that in all cases involving employees engaged on probationary basis, the
employer shall make known to the employee at the time he is hired, the standards

</span>Nowhere in the employment contract executed between <span class="GramE">petitioner

stipulation that the latter shall undergo a probationary period for three
months before he can qualify as a regular employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is also no evidence on record showing
that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> had been apprised of his
probationary status and the requirements which he should comply in order to be
a regular employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of
these requisites, there is justification in concluding that respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> was a regular employee at the time he was dismissed

to security of tenure during his period of employment and his services cannot

<p class="BODY">Article 282 of the Labor Code sets forth the following just
causes for which an employer may terminate an employment, namely:</p>

</span>Serious misconduct or willful disobedience by the employee of the lawful
orders of his employer or representative in connection with his work;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

authorized representative;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Commission of a crime
or offense by the employee against the person of his employer or any immediate
member of his family or his duly authorized representative; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(e)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other causes analogous
to the foregoing."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The alleged ground of unsatisfactory performance relied upon by
petitioner for dismissing respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> is not
one of the just causes for dismissal provided in the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it included among the grounds for
termination of employment under Article VII of the contract of employment
executed by <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> (p. 18, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner has failed to show proof
of the particular acts or omissions constituting the unsatisfactory performance
of <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> of his duties, which was allegedly due to
his poor physical state after the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to petitioner's claims, records show that the medical
certificate issued by the hospital where respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span>
was confined as a result of the accident, clearly and positively stated that <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> was already physically fit for work after he was
released from the hospital (p. 102, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Anent the respondent
Commission's finding of lack of due process in the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span>, the petitioner claims that notice and hearing are
important only if the employee is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not
aware </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the problems </span>affecting
his employment; that the same is not true in the instant case where respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> knew all along that he could no longer effectively
perform his job due to his physical condition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We find that this contention has no legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The twin requirements of notice and hearing constitute essential
elements of due process in cases of employee dismissal:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the requirement of notice is intended to
inform the employee concerned of the employer's intent to dismiss and the
reason for the proposed dismissal, while the requirement of hearing affords the
employee an opportunity to answer his employer's charges against him and
accordingly to defend himself <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> before
dismissal is effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither of these
requirements can be dispensed with without running afoul of the due process
requirement of the constitution (Century Textile Mills, Inc., et al. v. NLRC,
et al., G.R. No. 77859, May 25, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span>
was not, in any manner, notified of the charges against him before he was <span class="SpellE">outrightly</span> dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither was any hearing or investigation conducted by the company to
give the respondent a chance to be heard concerning the alleged unsatisfactory
performance of his work.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the dismissal of respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> violated the security of tenure under the contract
of employment which specifically provides that the contract term shall be for a
period of twelve (12) calendar months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> should be
paid his salary for the unexpired portion of his contract of employment which
is ten (10) months (See <span class="SpellE">Cuales</span> v. NLRC, et al., No. <span class="GramE">L-57379, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 28, 1983</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 121 SCRA 812).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the POEA and the respondent Commission that the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Grulla</span> is entitled to salaries in the
amount of US $3,700.00 or its equivalent in Philippine currency for the
unexpired portion of his contract and the sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as reimbursement of medical expenses bear great weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well-established is the principle that
findings of administrative agencies which have acquired expertise because their
jurisdiction is confined to specific matters are generally accorded not only
respect but even finality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judicial
review by this Court on labor cases does not go so far as to evaluate the
sufficiency of the evidence upon which the labor officer or office based his or
its determination but are limited to issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of
discretion (Special Events and Central Shipping Office Workers Union v. San
Miguel Corporation, Nos. <span class="GramE">L-51002-06, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 30, 1983</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 122 SCRA 557).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the instant case, the assailed Resolution of the respondent Commission is not
tainted with arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion or
lack of jurisdiction and therefore, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no reason
to disturb the same.</p>
