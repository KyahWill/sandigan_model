considering the seriousness of the charge and the sensitive nature of
petitioner's office, and without bothering to comply with the mandatory pro­visions
of Section 1 (a) of Presidential Decree No. 77, dated December 6, 1972, namely,
that the statement of the complainant or his witnesses should be sworn to

Revised Rules of Court, which require that complaints against CFI Judges should
be filed with the Supreme Court, peremptorily gave due course to said complaint

serve his answer or counter-affidavits and other supporting papers
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>11. On the morning of February
18, 1974, just as petitioner was about to ascend the rostrum to start the first
session in his Court, after 6 months absence <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
due to his detail as CFI Judge of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, Branch I,
said subpoena was served upon him in a jam-packed courtroom, filled with
practitioners and spectators who were not there for any case but to witness the
reaction of petitioner to the service of said subpoena, in further disregard of
the spirit behind Section 6 of Rule 140, Revised Rules of Court, </span>on the
confidentiality of proceedings against judges."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>

</span>There was no explicit denial of certain allegations indicative of the
hostility mani­fested towards petitioner Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, the ten-page comment relied on what was considered to be
applicable decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
effort to refute the allegation that there was a failure to abide by the
requirements of Presidential Decree No. 77, but, it was argued that there was
substantial compliance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, there was
a misread­ing of the opinion of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>
v. Salas,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> concerning the broad scope of the power of
the President over executive officials.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It certainly lacks the neces­sary persuasiveness to justify the lifting

Judge saw the opportunity to file a reply, and on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="6"><span style="">June 27, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, did so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After noting that the other private respondents failed to contest the
petition, the reply stressed that the pattern of <span class="SpellE">harrassment</span>
was quite obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Under date of September 17th, 1973,
Atty. <span style="">Martin </span>Vera Cruz, a
disgruntled barrister who lost 6 out of the 9 cases he filed before petitioner's

do?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He convened the Board of Directors
of the local IBP chapter and out of its 9-man membership, 5 attended, as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) Atty. Andres <span class="SpellE">Bersales</span>, its President and the Pro­vincial Board
Secretary, who lost all his cases before petitioner's <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">2) Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pielago</span>, who works with

officially approved in such capacity payment of all the disbursements of
petitioner now being questioned.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>5) Atty. Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>, who lost all except
one of the cases he handles before petitioner's <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The five of them, without the concurrence or
attendance of the remaining 4 members of the 9-man Board of Directors of the
Integrated Bar Chapter of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> on so important a subject, peremptorily passed
resolution no. 7 resolving to file not only administrative but criminal charges
against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution
discloses 2 things:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, <span style="">it is </span>not reflective of the collective
will of the IBP Chapter concerned because it was a divided Board that acted on
it and, second, the five members who voted for it without the parti­cipation of
the 4 others have 'axes to grind' against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of them, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bersales</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>, invariably lost their cases before
petitioner's <span class="SpellE">sala</span> while Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pielago</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> are subordinates of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bersales</span> in the Governor's Office."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To indicate that the
complaint was filed as a mani­festation of vindictiveness and for the
humiliation of petitioner judge, the reply characterized the resolution of the
Integrated Bar of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> chapter as having been
"railroaded," petitioner not having been given a chance to explain
his side contrary to procedural </span>due <span style="">process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He strengthened his
petition by quoting the full text of the answer of retired Justice J. B. L.
Reyes, then President of the Integrated Bar of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> rejecting the plea of such chapter to
support the crimi­nal case filed with the respondent City Fiscal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Such letter of Justice </span><span style="">J. </span><span style="">B. L. Reyes should be quoted in full:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"We have just received copy of
Resolution No. 10 of your Chapter, recommending that administrative and
criminal charges be filed against Judge <span class="SpellE">Willelmo</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and requesting the preventive suspension of said Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing that immediately attracted our
attention is that nowhere in the resolution is there any indication that the
respondent Judge <span class="GramE">was informed</span> of the charges studied
by the Grievance Committee, nor does it appear that said respondent was given
an opportunity to present his side before the Grievance Committee or the Board
of Officers adopted said Reso­lution No. 10.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is thus manifest that the action of the Chapter officers violated the
cardinal principles of fairness and due process that underlie the Rule of
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only this, but the Chapter's
action in this case has disregarded the fact that the integration of the Bar
sought to make it possible not only to protect lawyers and litigants and to
discipline and/or remove incompetent and unworthy judges, but also to '(4)
Shield the judiciary which traditionally cannot defend itself except within its
<span style="">own </span>forum,
from the assaults that politics and self-interest may level at it, and assist
it to maintain its integrity, impartiality and indepen­dence.' * * * The
unseemly haste with which the Chapter appears to have acted, referring the
charges to the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> office, without notice
to the respondent nor giving him opportunity to present his side before taking
action, precludes this national office from supporting the aforesaid Resolution
No. 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only this, but in the
absence of adequate explanation for such one-sided action on the part of your
Chapter, it will become the unavoidable duty of this Office to oppose the
suspension asked for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unfortunate
that lawyers who have taken an oath to support and defend the law and the
Constitution should choose to ignore the fundamental principle of due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore requested that
you remit to this Office a full report of the proceedings of the Grievance
Committee and the adoption of its recommendations by the Board of Officers, as
soon as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending receipt
thereof, we have asked the Honorable Supreme Court to withhold action on your
Chapter's request for preventive suspension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Board of Governors of the Integrated Bar is due to meet on <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be best if your report is received

<p class="BODY"><span style="">No effort was made either
by respondent City Fiscal or any of the private respondents to dispel in any
way the grave doubts raised as to the <u>bona</u> <u>fides</u> in the <span style="">filing of this complaint against
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A memoran­</span>dum was
submitted by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents
maintained <span style="">their silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The only explanation appears to be
their realization that the petition is meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">So we find.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prohibition <span style="">lies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the outset, reference
was made to the invo­cation by petitioner-Judge of the leading <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span> decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Seven years after its promulgation, in 1930 to be precise, it was relied
upon in Tong v. <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span> &amp; Standard Oil Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Justice <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> as <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>
stressed that "the remedy of prohibition is somewhat <span class="SpellE"><u>sui-generis</u></span>,
and is one more or less of legal discretion, and i<span style="">s </span>intended to prevent the oppressive exercise of legal
authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Such categorical enunciation of one of the most highly valued principles of
equity ought to have cautioned respondent City Fiscal against, in the language
of then President of the Integrated Bar of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
retired Justice J. B. L. Reyes, acting with "unseemly haste." This is
one occasion then that calls for the exercise of the equitable powers of this
Court to repudiate what was clearly an "oppressive exer­cise of legal
authority." It only remains to be added that <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span>
has been cited with approval in a number of cases subsequent to Tong v. <span class="SpellE">Santamaria</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sad and lamentable
spectacle that this case presents, a judge being subjected to <span class="SpellE">harrassment</span> and humiliation, fortunately is not
typical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can diminish public
confidence in the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very
least, it minimizes the respect properly owing an occupant of the bench.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever be the motive of respondent City
Fiscal, <span style="">the impression yielded is </span>that
such excessive zeal was not prompted solely by obedience to his oath of
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appearance, hopefully not
the reality, could only be that of sheer vindictiveness or oppressive exercise
of state authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was oblivious of
the fact that the judiciary and the prosecution service are both essential
agencies in the enforcement of penal statutes, not antagonists. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>At times it has been said, and with reason,
that the rights of an accused person could be emasculated, even rendered
nugatory, if a judge and the prosecuting fiscal are on the most amicable terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Respondent</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> Fiscal in this case erred on
the other extreme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the first to
lend <span class="GramE">himself</span> to a scheme that could have no other
purpose than to place petitioner-Judge in contempt and disrepute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such conduct calls for vigorous
condemnation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution cannot be
any more explicit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Public office
is a public trust."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
A public official must keep uppermost in his mind that the sole guide in the
performance of his duties is the paramount need of the public service.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition made
reference to an Executive Order outlining the procedure on complaints charging
government officials and employees with commission of irregularities.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
It is therein provided that com­plaints against presidential <span class="GramE">appointees,</span>
and judges are included among them, "shall be filed with the Office of the
President or the Department Head having direct supervision or control over the
official involved."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
At present, the department head is the Supreme Court, the Constitution having
expressly vested the power of supervision over all courts to this Tribunal.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The removal of such power in the Department of Justice in 1973, now the
Ministry of Justice, is a recognition of the need to preserve unimpaired the
independence of the judiciary, especially so at present, where to all intents
and purposes, there is a fusion between the executive and the legislative
branches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many are the ways by which
such independence could be eroded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
the present instance is a rare aberration, it could happen again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When such a case occurs, this Court must act <span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">-</span></span> and
promptly to set matters right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what
the Court did in its resolution immediately issuing a tem­porary restraining
order upon the petition being filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot be too strongly emphasized that a judge <span style="">of </span>an inferior court is deserving of the full protection <span style="">of </span>this Tribunal against any form of
vexation, inconvenience, or <span class="SpellE">harrassment</span>, the more so
when, as is quite evident, haste and recklessness marked the conduct <span style="">of </span>respondent City Fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let there be no misunderstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Our </span>ruling
does not signify that this Tribunal is averse to a judge facing charges against
him, if presented in the manner provided for by law and with <u>bona</u> <u>fides</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of administrative supervision
precisely <span style="">has </span>been granted to
this Court to assure that malefactors on the bench suffer for their
misdeeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, however, when, as
did happen here, a complaint was utilized to embarrass and humiliate a member
of the judiciary, it is broad enough to include such remedial action in aid of
a judge, who, to all the appearances, is the victim of a deliberate attempt to
impugn his good name and reputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
judicial power constitutionally granted to this Court, independently of the grant
<span style="">of </span>supervisory
authority, justifies the intervention of this Court in a case like the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The characterization by
retired Justice J. B. L. Reyes, then President of the Integrated Bar of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
of the "unseemly haste" that marked the actuation of respondent
members of the Board of Directors of the Integrated Bar Chapter of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> City Chapter, appears to be rather mild - all
things considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pointed out that
there was a violation of the cardinal principles of fairness and due process
that underlie the Rule of Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner-Judge was not heard; he was denied the opportunity to defend
himself against the accusation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was, on the part of private respondents then, a failure to abide by a
Resolution of the Integrated Bar stressing that precisely integration could
shield "the judiciary which traditionally cannot defend itself except within
its own forum, from the assaults that politics and self-interest may level at
it, and assist it to maintain its integrity, impartiality and
independence.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
A greater sense of responsibility, not to say <span style="">a </span>more adequate grasp of the cardinal requirements of due
process as well as of the applicable procedural rules, ought to have been
displayed by private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, they did not even make any effort to dispute the accuracy of
the imputation of being disgruntled members of the <span style="">bar </span>with a record of losing cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That apparently was the motive for their
accusation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They paid no attention to
the norm of conduct that lawyers should observe as officers of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The then officers of the Integrated Bar, in­cluded
as private respondents, have an even greater res­ponsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, they were <span class="GramE">recreant</span>
to the trust reposed on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
