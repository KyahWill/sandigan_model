				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
resolution of respondent Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals)
dated January 31, 1986 vacating its prior decision dated June 29, 1984 and
ordering that the records of the case be remanded to the Court of First
Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Manila, and its resolution dated May 19,
1986 denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Herbert <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span>
purchased on credit petroleum products from petitioner <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
Philippines, Inc. (CALTEX, for short).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As of <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1969</st1:date>,
his indebtedness to CALTEX has amounted to P361<span class="GramE">,218.66</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On October 4, 1969, <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span>
executed a Deed of First Mortgage in favor of CALTEX over a parcel of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>land covered by OCT No. 0-274 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the Register of Deeds for the Province
of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte to secure his debts to the
latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On various occasions, CALTEX
sent to <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span> statements <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>account and later demanded payment of his entire debts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of <span class="SpellE">Manzana's</span>
failure and refusal to pay, CALTEX filed a complaint on <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1970</st1:date> before the trial court for the
recovery of the whole amount of P361<span class="GramE">,218.66</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1970</st1:date>, CALTEX foreclosed <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
the mortgaged property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1970</st1:date>, the mortgaged
property was sold at auction to CALTEX, being the only bidder, for P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as shown by the Sheriff's Certificate of Sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The foreclosure was allegedly known by <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span> only on <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="10">October
 4, 1980</st1:date> when such fact was manifested by CALTEX in its reply to the
opposition of <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span> to the motion for execution
pending appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 23, 1980, the trial court rendered judgment ordering <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span> to pay CALTEX the amount of P353,218.66 after
deducting P8,000.00 paid by Traders Insurance and Surety Company on its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">surety </span>bond, with interest thereon at
12% per annum from August 17, 1970, plus 20% thereof as attorney's fees (p.

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Manzana</span> appealed the trial court's
decision to the respondent Intermediate Appellate Court raising the following
issues (p. 37, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

indebtedness after having already foreclosed the property securing the
same" (p. 37, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1984</st1:date>,
the respondent court rendered a decision (pp. 36-39, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
affirming <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the appealed decision
after "finding no reversible error" therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1984</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span> filed a motion for
reconsideration of said decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its
comment to the motion for reconsideration, CALTEX prayed that "the
judgment sought to be reconsidered be modified by deducting the amount of
P20,000.00 (foreclosure amount) from P353,218.66 thereby leaving a balance of
P333,218.66 representing the deficiency that plaintiff?<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is entitled to recover from defendant-appellant
plus interest, attorney's fees and costs of suit" (p. 41, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the motion for reconsideration, the respondent court
issued a resolution dated <st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="1">January 31,
 1986</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which
reads (p. 59, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues may be limited to the following:</p>

avail at the same time of a personal action in court for collection of a sum of

mere filing of a collection suit for the recovery of the debt secured by real

filing of the complaint for recovery of the amount of indebtedness and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>subsequent extrajudicial
foreclosure of the deed of first mortgage constitutes splitting of a single
cause of action.</blockquote>

cited by CALTEX is actually a specific provision while the fourth paragraph and
the fourth condition cited by <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span> are general
provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This interpretation is
bolstered by the third WHEREAS clause and the penultimate paragraph of the

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, in
the absence of express statutory provisions, a mortgage creditor may institute
against the mortgage debtor either a personal action for debt or a real action
to foreclose the mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, he may pursue either of the two remedies, but not both.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By such election, his cause of action can by
no means be impaired, for each of the two remedies is complete in itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, an election to bring a personal action
will leave open to him all the properties of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the debtor for attachment and execution, even including the mortgaged
property itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, if he waives such
personal action and pursues his remedy against the mortgaged property, an
unsatisfied judgment thereon would still give him the right to sue for a
deficiency judgment, in which case, all the properties of the defendant, other
than the mortgaged property, are again open to him for the satisfaction of the
deficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In either case, his remedy
is complete, his cause of action undiminished, and any advantages attendant to
the pursuit of one or the other remedy are purely accidental and are all </span>under
his right of election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, where a debt is secured by a mortgage and there is a
default in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">payment on </span>the part
of the mortgagor, the mortgagee has a choice of one (1) of two (2) remedies,
but he cannot have both.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mortgagee
may:</p>

<blockquote>1) <span class="GramE">foreclose</span> the mortgage; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) <span class="GramE">file</span> an ordinary action to collect the
debt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When the mortgagee chooses the foreclosure of the mortgage as a
remedy, he enforces his lien by the sale on foreclosure of the mortgaged
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceeds of the sale will
be applied to the satisfaction of the debt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>With this remedy, he has a prior lien on the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case of a deficiency, the mortgagee has
the right to claim for the deficiency resulting from the price obtained in the
sale of the real property at public auction and the outstanding obligation at
the time of the foreclosure proceedings (<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> v.
Enriquez, 24 Phil. 584; <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> de <span class="SpellE">Islas</span>

53 Phil. 86; <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> <span class="SpellE">Nacional</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Barreto</span>, 53 Phil. 101).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, if the mortgagee resorts to an action to
collect the debt, he thereby waives his mortgage lien.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He will have no more priority over the
mortgaged property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the judgment in
the action to collect is favorable to him, and it becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, he can enforce said judgment by execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He can even levy execution on the same
mortgaged property, but he will not have priority over the latter and there may
be other creditors who have better lien on the properties of the mortgagor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">CALTEX submits that the
principles enunciated in the <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> case are <span class="GramE">not applicable nor</span> determinative of the case at bar for the
reason that the factual circumstances obtained in the said case are totally
different from the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> case, the plaintiff instituted an action to
foreclose the mortgage after the money judgment in its favor remained
unsatisfied whereas in the present case, CALTEX initially filed a complaint for
collection of the debt and during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
thereof foreclosed <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> the mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the
facts in the <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> case and in the present case
are not identical, there is similarity in the fact that the plaintiffs in these
two cases availed of both remedies although they are entitled to a choice of
only one.</p>

<p class="BODY">CALTEX alleges next that the mere act of filing a collection suit
for the recovery of a debt secured by real estate mortgage is not tantamount to
an implied waiver of the mortgage lien.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under Philippine jurisdiction, there is no statute which prohibits or
precludes a mortgagee from subsequently foreclosing the real estate mortgage
shortly after the collection suit has been filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The real estate mortgage itself does not
contain any explicit provision that the filing of a collection suit would mean
waiver of the remedy of foreclosure.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We hold otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere act of </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">filing</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>collection
suit for the recovery of a debt secured by a mortgage constitutes waiver of the
other remedy of foreclosure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
rationale behind this was adequately explained in the <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
case, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, a
rule that would authorize the plaintiff to bring a personal action against the
debtor and simultaneously or successively another action against the mortgaged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">property, would result not only in
multiplicity of suits so offensive to justice (<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Enriques</span>, 24 Phil. 584) and obnoxious to law and
equity (Osorio vs. San Agustin, 25 Phil. 404), but also in subjecting the
defendant to the vexation of being sued in the place of his residence or of the
residence of the plaintiff, and then again in the place where the property
lies."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In the present case, however, <span class="GramE">We</span> shall not follow this rule to the letter but declare that
it is the collection suit which was waived and/or abandoned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ruling
is more in harmony with the principles underlying our judicial system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is of no moment that the collection suit
was filed ahead, what is </span>determinative is the fact that the foreclosure
proceedings <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ended</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>even before the decision in the
collection suit was rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, CALTEX informed the trial court that it had already
consolidated its ownership over the property, in its reply to the opposition of
<span class="SpellE">Manzana</span> to the motion for execution pending appeal
filed by it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A corollary issue that We
might as well resolve now (although not raised as <span class="GramE">an</span>

et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Gayos</span>, et al., G.R. No. L-27812, September
26, 1975, 67 SCRA 146, that it is a cherished rule of procedure that a court
should always strive to settle the entire </span>controversy in a single
proceeding leaving no root or branch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to

sue for a deficiency judgment --- P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> (secured
debt of P120,000.00 less the foreclosure amount of P20,000.00).</p>

<p class="BODY">The collection suit filed before the trial court cannot be
considered as a deficiency judgment because a deficiency judgment has been
defined as one for the balance of the indebtedness after applying the proceeds
of the sale of the mortgaged property to such indebtedness and is necessarily
filed after the foreclosure proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is significant to note that the judgment rendered by the trial court
was for the full amount of the indebtedness and the case was filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">prior to the foreclosure proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

judgment is in the nature of an ordinary money judgment, may constitute a cause
of action and is barred by the statute of limitations applicable to ordinary
judgment (59 C.J.S. 1497).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ten (10)
year period provided in Articles 1142 and 1144 of the Civil Code applies to a
suit for deficiency judgment, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">CALTEX has only one cause
of action against <span class="SpellE">Manzana</span>, that is, non-payment of
the debt although two choices of remedies are available to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As held in the <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
case, <u>supra</u>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"For non-payment of a note secured by mortgage, the creditor
has a single cause of action against the debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This single cause of action consists in the
recovery of the credit with execution of the security.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the creditor in his action
may make two demands, the payment of the debt and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the foreclosure of his mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But both demands arise from the same cause, the non­payment of the debt,
and, for that reason, they constitute a single cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Though the debt and the mortgage constitute
separate agreements, the latter is subsidiary to the former, and both refer to
one and the same obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, there exists only one cause of action for a single breach
of that obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, then, by
applying the rule above stated, cannot split up his single cause of action by
filing </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">complaint for payment
of the debt, and thereafter another complaint for foreclosure of the
mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he does so, the filing of
the first complaint will bar the subsequent complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By allowing the creditor to file two separate
<span class="GramE">complaint</span> simultaneously or successively, one to
recover his credit and another to foreclose his mortgage, we will, in effect,
be authorizing him plural redress for </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

much vexation and oppression to the debtor."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
