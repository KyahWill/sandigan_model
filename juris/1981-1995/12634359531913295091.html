<p class="BODY">Thereupon, trial proceeded against accused Rosita Villena and
Placido Palangoy.  Aside from Luisa
Villena y Altiche, the other witnesses presented by the prosecution were
Patrolmen Felicito de Belen, Oscar Enriquez and Jose Marcelino, Jr. of the
Integrated National Police (INP) of Malolos, Bulacan, Dr. Juanito Sacdalan, Dr.
Rolando Victoria, Dr. Isadora Gatbonton and Eduardo Vinuya, a neighbor of the
victims.  The defense, on the other
hand, presented Celso Algoba who was by then already serving sentence, Rosita
Villena and Placido Palangoy.  Accused
Ricardo Lascuna, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">who </span>was
likewise serving sentence, was subpoenaed but failed to appear.  Apparently, on 26 July 1989, he escaped from
detention.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence establishes the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">Luisa Villena y Altiche, together with her eight-month-old
daughter and brother Honesto Altiche, was in her house at Bgy. Cofradia,
Malolos, Bulacan on the night of 16 October 1988.  Honesto was staying with her since her husband was working abroad.  While both Honesto and Luisa were watching a
television show at around 7:00 o'clock, the latter's sister-in-law, Rosita
Villena, knocked on the door of the house.  When Luisa opened the door, Rosita came in with her daughter and four
strangers, three of whom the former later identified in court as the accused
Celso Algoba, Ricardo Lascuna and Placido Palangoy.  The fourth person, identified as Danilo Lagasca, was not present
in court.  Ricardo Lascuna and Danilo
Lagasca were both carrying knives which they poked at Luisa and Honesto while Celso
Algoba and Placido Palangoy started ransacking the house.  Luisa and her brother were then gagged and
their hands and feet were tied.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> Both
were herded inside the bedroom where Luisa was raped by Ricardo Lascuna while
Honesto was asked to turn his back.  Thereafter, Luisa was dragged into the kitchen<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> where
she heard her brother, who was still inside the bedroom with Danilo Lagasca and
Ricardo Lascuna, start moaning.  She
then lost consciousness and was left for dead after being strangled with pieces
of cloth.  Before this, however, Luisa
noticed that Rosita Villena was the person giving out instructions to her
co-accused.  Luisa claims that she was
able to recognize the persons who entered her house since they stayed there
from 7:00 o'clock in the evening of 16 October 1988 up to 2:00 o'clock in the
morning of the following day.  Based on
what she heard from them, it appears that the accused could not leave earlier
because of a checkpoint in the area.  It
was only after regaining consciousness at around 3:00 o'clock that same morning
that Luisa was able to free herself.  Upon doing so, she proceeded to the bedroom where she found her brother
who was already dead.  She also discovered
that an instamatic camera, a man's gold ring, a gold wrist watch, assorted
clothes, a ladies’ gold ring, <s>P</s>400.00 in cash and a pair of toy
walkie-talkies were missing.  All told,
her loss amounted to <s>P</s>4,900.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> Luisa
then sought the help of a neighbor, Eduardo Vinuya.  Vinuya brought her to his house and, together with his cousin and
nephew, later proceeded to her house; upon reaching the house, they discovered
its kitchen and living room in disarray.  Inside the bedroom, they found the body of Honesto with an electric cord
tied around his neck.  They immediately
reported the crime to the barangay captain of Cofradia and the police
authorities.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
As a result thereof, a police team was dispatched to the scene of the
crime.  At around 6:00 o'clock that same
morning, Luisa Villena was questioned in the police station where she revealed
that one of the persons who entered her house was her sister-in-law, Rosita
Villena.  A police team was thus
dispatched to apprehend the latter in Bgy. Ibayo, Marilao, Bulacan.  While being ferried to the station in the
police car, Rosita, when asked who her companions were, implicated Celso Algoba
-- her live-in partner -- a certain Dong, Placido (Palangoy) and Danny (Danilo
Lagasca).  She then led the policemen to
the latter's respective houses.  With
the exception of Danilo Lagasca who was able to escape, the other accused were
apprehended and brought to the police station where they were identified by
Luisa.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
At the station, accused Palangoy was wearing a polo shirt and a pair of pants
(Exhibits "F-2" and "F-3") which were among the items taken
from Luisa's house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pat. Jose Marcelino, Jr., a member of the team dispatched to the
crime scene, prepared a sketch of the house where the crime was committed.  He likewise stated that the house was in
disarray when he entered it and that the body of Luisa's brother was inside the
bedroom with its hands bound together by an electric cord; an electric cord was
also coiled around its neck.  For her
part, accused Rosita Villena admitted participating in the commission of the
crime but such admission was not reduced to writing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy of Honesto Altiche's body, conducted by Dr. Juanito
Sacdalan, Municipal Health Officer of Malolos, Bulacan, revealed that there
were marks on the neck and wrists of the victim.  Honesto's death was attributed to "[A]spyxia (sic) due to
occluded trachea and esophagus," and the breaking of the trachea as a
result of strangulation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Dr. Rolando Victoria found abrasions in the
neck of Luisa Villena<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
while Dr. Isadora Gatbonton's internal examination revealed "a normal
looking external genitalia; labia minora and majora; clitoris were all intact
with superficial abrasion 0-3 cm. over the posterior fourchette; negative
bleeding; x x x nagative (sic) tenderness, negative abnormal cischarge (sic); x
x x negative spermatozoa."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> Dr.
Gatbonton declared that the superficial abrasion "could possibly be
secondary to irritation wherein a patient has a tendency to scratching (sic) so
that abrasion is brought about and another possible cause is violent (sic)
attempt of penetration or insertion of any object."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Testifying for the defense, Celso Algoba admitted that he robbed
Luisa Villena's house on 16 October 1989 together with Ricardo Lascuna, Danilo
Lagasca and another person whose name he does not know.  Celso, however, denied that Rosita Villena
-- his live-in partner -- and accused Placido Palangoy were with them at the
time.  According to him, Rosita was in
their apartment in Marilao, Bulacan at the time of the commission of the crime.  While claiming to have no knowledge of
Luisa's rape, Algoba declared that Ricardo Lascuna and Danilo Lagasca strangled
the latter and killed Honesto Altiche.  When presented with an item recovered from Placido Palangoy, Algoba
stated that he sold the same to the latter for <s>P</s>60.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For her part, Rosita Villena denied any participation in the
crime.  She testified that she was at
home with her daughter on the night of 16 October 1988 and that when she woke
up at 7:00 o'clock the next morning, some policemen arrived, searched their
things and took the toy walkie-talkies from them.  She averred that it was Celso who brought the said toy
walkie-talkies home and recounted to her the robbery staged in the house of
Luisa Villena.  Although she wanted to
report the matter to the authorities, Rosita desisted because Celso threatened
her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Placido Palangoy also denied participating in the commission of
the crime.  He claimed that on the night
of 16 October 1988, he was washing his child's diapers upon orders of his wife.  After doing so, he went to sleep.  The next morning, after hanging the diapers
out to dry and taking a bath, he was approached by a stranger who sold him
clothes for <s>P</s>60.00.  A few
moments later, the same stranger returned to Palangoy's house <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with some policemen.  Palangoy was thereupon brought to the police
station with three other men; in the station, they were confronted by a lady
who declared that they were the persons who robbed her house.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Subject to the observations and modifications hereinafter
indicated, we are left with no choice but to affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assigned error results from a misreading of the
challenged decision for as correctly contended by the appellee, the appellant's
conviction is not based on the admissions of the accused Rosita Villena.  It appears that the appellant's conclusion
proceeds from the trial court's summary of the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses found under the sub­-heading PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE.  It is to be observed that the court's own
findings of fact, capsulized under the sub-heading FINDINGS AND FACTS, do not
even make any reference to any admission made by the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the bottom of the second imputed error lies the issue of the
sufficiency of the appellant's explanation of his possession of the pair of
"maong" pants and polo shirt which were among the personal items
taken from Luisa Villena's house on the night of the incident.  The appellant claims to have purchased the
same from Celso Algoba in the morning of 17 October 1988 while he (appellant)
was drying his child's diapers.  We are
not persuaded at all by this concocted story.  At the police station's information section where he was seen by Luisa
Villena wearing the said items of clothing, the appellant did not even
volunteer the information that Celso had sold the clothes to him.  The latter only offered his explanation when
he testified in court.  As hereinafter
discussed, he was positively identified by Luisa Villena as one of the
perpetrators of the robbery.  Thus, he
miserably failed to overcome the presumption that a person found to be in
possession of the effects belonging to a person robbed and killed is considered
the author of the aggression, death of the person and the robbery committed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his third assigned error, the appellant faults the trial court
for not giving due weight to his alibi and contends that he was not positively
and clearly identified as one of the perpetrators of the crime; he avers that
Luisa Villena did not single him out from a police line-up.  Moreover, he claims that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Luisa
Villena did not know, with the exception of Rosita Villena -- her
sister-in-law, any of the accused before they were </span>presented to
her.  Again, we are not persuaded.  In the first place, while it is true that
Rosita was the only person whom Luisa knew by name, it does not necessarily
follow that the latter could not identify the rest of the accused.  In fact, Luisa did just that at the police
station and in court during trial.  Secondly, it was Rosita Villena who revealed the identities of her
co-accused and even led the police team to the latter's houses where they, with
the exception of Danilo Lagasca, were apprehended.</p>

Luisa in the morning after the incident, testified that the latter did not
complain to him that she had been raped; on the other hand, Dr. Gatbonton, the

There is no reason for Luisa Villena to claim that she had been raped if it was
not true.  Considering a Filipina's
inbred modesty and antipathy in airing publicly things that affect her honor,
it is hard to conceive that Luisa would undergo the expense, trouble and
inconvenience of a public trial, suffer the scandal, embarrassment and
humiliation such action would indubitably invite and allow the examination of
her private part if she had not been raped and her motive was other than to
bring to justice the person who committed the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the examining obstetrician declared that
she was not sure whether Luisa had actually been raped, the former nevertheless
admitted that it was possible that she was.</p>

<p class="BODY">And even if the trial court had indeed asked "leading and
misleading questions," it is now too late for the appellant to raise his
objection thereto in this appeal.  His
counsel should have interposed the appropriate objections to such questions at
the time they were asked.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of his fifth assigned error, the appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">contends </span>that granting, <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">arguendo,<b> </b></span></i>that he was
indeed one of the malefactors, the trial court nonetheless erred in finding him
guilty of rape and homicide since no evidence was presented to show his
participation in or knowledge of the commission thereof.  He adds that the doctrine in this
jurisdiction -- that when the homicide takes place as a consequence of or on
occasion of a robbery, all those who took part in the robbery are guilty as
principals of the crime of robbery with homicide, unless proof is presented
that the accused tried to prevent the killing -- should not be applied to him
since he could not have prevented someone from doing something which he
(appellant) was not even aware of in the first place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such reasoning is terribly flawed.  The general rule is that whenever a homicide is committed as a
consequence, or on occasion of a robbery, all those who took part therein are
liable as principals of the crime of robbery with homicide, although some did
not actually take part in the homicide.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a> Besides,
it is difficult to believe that the appellant was not aware of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">killing of Honesto Altiche.  Luisa Villena's house was not large enough
to allow any of the accused to have his privacy as the same is a mere one
bedroom affair, with a sala and kitchen which have no partitions at all.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the kitchen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">For his sixth ascribed
error, the appellant would have us credit him with the mitigating circumstances

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Paragraph 3, Article 13
of the Revised Penal Code addresses itself to the intention of the offender at
the particular moment when he executes or commits the criminal act, and not to
his intention during the planning stage.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Thus, while it may be argued that the
agreement was only to rob the victims, the perpetrators' acts at the time of
the incident show that the conspiracy not only contemplated the commission of
the robbery, but also the elimination of any witnesses to the crime.  Therefore, the mitigating circumstance of
lack of intention to commit so grave a wrong cannot be appreciated in favor of
the appellant.  Besides, conspiracy
having been proven in this case, the act of one is the act of all.  Corollarily, the circumstance of "analogous
circumstances" cannot find application in the instant case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We find, however, the
straight penalty of 12 years and 1 day to 20 years imposed on Ricardo Lascuna
and Celso Algoba after they had changed their plea from not guilty to guilty,
to be erroneous.  The penalty for
robbery with homicide under the first </span>paragraph of Article <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">294 </span>of the Revised Penal Code is <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">reclusion </span>perpetua </i>to death.  Since, as hereinafter discussed, the rape
committed against Luisa aggravated the crime, the imposable penalty would have
been death had its imposition not been prohibited by Section 19(1), Article III
of the 1987 Constitution.  Accordingly,
the penalty that should have been imposed upon them is<i> reclusion
perpetua.  </i>Additionally, both should
have been made civilly liable for their acts.  While we are not concerned here with accused Lascuna and Algoba as the
judgment against them has become final by their service of sentence, the trial
court's mistake in imposing the said penalty on the two cannot now benefit the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Finally, we find
ourselves unable to accommodate the appellant in his last assigned error.  He claims that he was denied due process
because the trial judge displayed manifest bias and prejudice against him by
asking questions which led witnesses to a preconceived notion of what the facts
are, and of promulgating a judgment "right in the hearing when the defense
presented its case and within seconds after both sides rested their
cases."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Such behavior does not manifest bias or
prejudice <i>per se</i> for in view of the fact that the parties did not opt to
submit their respective memoranda, the court forthwith considered the case
submitted for decision.  A trial judge
who has painstakingly listened to the testimonies of the witnesses, taken notes
of such testimonies and meticulously observed the latter's deportment and
manner of testifying may logically be presumed to have properly made up his
mind on what the decision should be.  What may therefore remain for him is the actual writing of the
decision.  Judges are not required to
await the transcription of the stenographic notes before they can render their
decisions;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

if this were so, there would be undue delays <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>the criminal justice system with judges easily finding
justification for failing to comply with the mandatory period to decide
cases.  Hence, the promulgation of
judgment by a Judge who, on the same hour, had first considered the case
submitted for his decision, does not <i>ipso facto </i>warrant a presumption of
bias.  This is true in the instant case
where our own review of the evidence sustains beyond reasonable doubt the
judgment of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">conviction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It must, however, be stressed here that the "verbal"
judgment promulgated by the trial court was incomplete as it does not contain
findings of fact and is not signed by the Judge.  The Constitution provides that no decision shall be rendered by
any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the
law on which it is based.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a> In
criminal cases, Section 2, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court requires that a
"judgment must be written in the official language, personally and
directly prepared by the judge and signed by him and shall contain clearly and
distinctly a statement of the facts proved or admitted by the accused and the
law upon which the judgment is based." Be that as it may, the infirmity
was corrected by the trial court itself when it subsequently issued a
full-blown Judgment -- dated 21 August 1989 -- which contains a summary of the
evidence for the parties, findings of fact and the signature of the Judge.  The records do not, however, yield any proof
that this full-blown Judgment was promulgated.  Such a promulgation was necessary considering that the sentence dictated
by the trial judge on 21 August 1989 is not similar in all respects to the
dispositive portion of the full-blown decision.  In view of the fact that in the Notice of Appeal, the appellant
explicitly refers to the Judgment dated <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

committed was erroneously designated as robbery with homicide, rape and
physical injuries.  The proper
designation is robbery with homicide aggravated by rape.  When rape and homicide co-exist in the
commission of robbery, it is the first paragraph of Article 294 of the Revised
Penal Code which applies, the rape to be considered as an aggravating
circumstance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

The physical injuries inflicted on Luisa Villena and the killing of Honesto
