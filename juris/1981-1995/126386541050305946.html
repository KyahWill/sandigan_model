alleged that he has been in possession of the same as owner, having paid taxes
thereon and has fully developed the property into a fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, however,
admitted that when he bought the property, he knew that it was covered by a
Fishpond Lease Agreement between Mateo Pablo and the Bureau of Fisheries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he himself had a lease agreement
with said Bureau over the same property on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="5"><span style="">May 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> for ten (10) years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">Thus,
the records show that the deed of absolute sale with assumption of mortgage
(Exhibit "W") is for the leasehold rights of the Vendor Assignor
Mateo Pablo over the same property and not on the ownership of the property
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said leasehold rights is
evidenced by Fishpond Lease Agreement No. 1473 of the Bureau of Fisheries dated
</span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="5"><span style="">May 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">

therein granted or any right acquired therein without the previous approval of
the <span class="SpellE">Lessor</span> (No. 12, Terms and Conditions).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, said lease was <span class="GramE">existing</span>
at the time of filing of the application for registration (TSN, May 3, 1976, p.
26).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">Furthermore,
it appears in the Bureau of Forestry Map LC-681 indicating the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> projects of the Bureau which was prepared </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1927" day="8" month="8"><span style="">August 8, 1927</span></st1:date><span style=""> (Exhibit "7") that the land in </span><span style="">question </span><span style="">is within the timberland Block H, Land Classification Project No. 32 of

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">As
testified by Alejandro Jimenez, Forester of the Bureau </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Forest Development assigned at <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City,
the land was originally a part of the communal forest land of </span><span class="SpellE">Anda</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pangasinan</span></span><span style="">

(TSN, June 1, 1976, pp. 2-4) reverted into timberland under Bureau of Forestry
Administration Order No. </span>2-565 <span style="">dated
March 14, 1959 and continued to be timberland as it had not been reclassified
into alienable </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">disposable land (TSN, May 3, 1976, p. 36).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent Gregorio </span><span style="">A. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Legaspi’s</span></span><span style=""> claim that subject</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">parcel
of land has been released and is within the alienable and disposable area as
evidenced by the letter of the Director </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Forestry (Exhibit
"U") was refuted by the testimony of Deputy Public Land Inspector
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Bacala</span> of Land District 1-7 <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City, who admitted that initially he submitted a
written report dated June 16, 1975 stating </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">aforesaid parcel of
land was within the alienable and disposable area but upon further
verification, he realized his mista</span>k<span style="">e and proceeded to rectify his error by a subsequent letter-report
dated August 20, 1975 addressed to his District Land Officer, where he
categorically stated that the land applied for had not </span><span style="">yet </span><span style="">been released as alienable and disposable but still remains within the
Timberland area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In fact, in a letter
dated April 5, 1961, eight months before Fishpond Permit No. 5018-D was issued
to Mateo Pablo, the Director of Forestry confirmed the fact that the area in
question was avai</span><span style="">l</span><span style="">able for fishpond</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">purposes
and that it is located inside Timberland Block H, L.C Project No. 32 of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Anda</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
and is within the territorial jurisdiction </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the District Forester
of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City (Exhibit "U").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In addition, Forester
Jimenez testified that when the President in 1967 allowed the conversion of
such leasehold rights to a title of ownership, private respondents did not </span><span style="">apply, </span><span style="">thereby giving the implication that they (respondents) preferred to
lease the fishponds in question (TSN, </span><span style="">Nov. 20, </span><span style="">19</span><span style="">7</span><span style="">5,
pp. 9, 11; TSN, May 3, 1976, pp. 37-40; 42).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Later, Section 13 of
Presidential Decree No. 43 known as the Fishery Industry Development Decree of
1972 issued on </span><st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="11"><span style="">November</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">9, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="">, prohibited the sale for fishpond, </span><span style="">public </span><span style="">lands already covered by lease agreements prior thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said prohibition was reiterated on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="5"><span style="">May 16,
 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> under Section
23, P.D. No. 704.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Notably, private
respondents filed their application for registration on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="13" month="6"><span style="">June 13,
 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, a period
already covered by the foregoing prohibition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Forester Jimenez further
confirmed that by his investigations, the land in dispute is an improved
fishpond covered by a ten-year lease agreement in the name of private
respondents which was transferred from their predecessor Mateo Pablo (TSN, May
3, 1976, </span><span style="">pp. </span><span style="">26, 33).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, it is already established that the nature and
character of a public land (as fishpond covered by a lease agreement) made in
the investigation report of the Bureau of Land is binding on the courts
(Republic v. De <span class="SpellE">Porkan</span>, 151 SCRA 88 [1987]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, as observed by
respondent court, it is obvious that the application for registration was
brought under Section 48(b) of the Public Land Act which requires thirty years
adverse possession in the concept of an owner by the applicant and/or his
predecessor-in-interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">Aside
from the fact that the only documentary evidence presented by private
respondents to prove possession are tax declarations which failed to prove 30
years of</span> <span style="">continuous possession
in the concept of owner, the land subject of registration is forest or
timberland which cannot be acquired by prescription (Bureau of Forestry v.
Court of Appeals, 153 SCRA 351 [1987]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said parcels of land are not capable of private appropriation and
possession thereof, no matter how long cannot ripen into ownership (Heirs </span>of
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Amunategui</span></span><span style=""> v. Director </span>of <span style="">Forestry, 126 SCRA 69 </span>[1983]; <span style="">Director of Lands v. Court of Appeals, 133

v. Court of Appeals, 153 SCRA 351 [1987]; Republic v. Court of Appeals, 154
SCRA 476 [1987]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indisputably, forest
land cannot be owned by private persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> (<span class="SpellE">Vallenta</span>
v. IAC, 151 SCRA 679 [1987].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that no trees could be found within the area does not divest the piece of land </span>of
<span style="">its classification as timber or forest
land as the classification is descriptive of its legal nature or status and
does </span>not <span style="">have to be descriptive
of what the land actually looks like (Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Amunategui</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In GR. No.</span></span><span style=""> L-36827, private respondents base their
claim over Lots Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (Plan Psu-114232) solely under an <span class="SpellE"><b>informacion</b></span><b> <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span></b><span style=""> </span>(<span class="SpellE">possessory</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">The
records show, however, that the applicants failed to establish the identity of
the land claimed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">Firstly,
there is a grave disparity in the boundaries of the land sought to be
registered and the lands covered by the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
information title so that it is evident that the land sought to be registered
is very different from the land described in the supposed <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
information title of the applicant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">Secondly,
the <span class="SpellE"><b>informacion</b></span><b> </b><span class="SpellE"><b style="">posesoria</b></span><span style=""> </span>speaks of an agricultural land - part <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>,
part <span class="SpellE">cornland</span> and part fruit orchard while the land
classification map 69, Project 51 of <span class="SpellE">Mangatarem</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> prepared in 1927 shows that the entire parcel of
land subject of this registration case is timber </span>or forest <span style="">land within the unclassified public forest
(Original Record with Exhibits, p. 495).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, during the ocular inspection of the area on March 16, 1967,
<span class="SpellE">Amado</span> Rosario, representative of private respondents,
admitted that the land subject of registration </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">inside the forest zone
(TSN, p. 167) which was also the comment made by the Commissioner (TSN, p.
164).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">Thirdly,
the area</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">covered by the <span class="SpellE"><b>informacion</b></span><b>
<span class="SpellE">posesoria</span> </b>title has a total area of 1,419

respondent Jose Gomez’ explanation that the discrepancy is due to the fact that
there was no actual survey in the <span class="SpellE"><b style="">informacion</b></span><b style=""> <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span></b><span style=""> </span>but
mere estimates as to the distance between two points (Original Record and Exhibits,
p. 342) while the application for registration was based on actual measurements
(TSN, Sept. 10, 1963, pp. 100, 152, 153) appears to be unacceptable as observed
by this Court under identical circumstances in <span class="SpellE">Carabot</span>
v. Court of Appeals (145 SCRA 368 [1986] where the <span class="SpellE"><b>informacion</b></span><b>
<span class="SpellE">posesoria</span></b> stated the areas of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">parcels of land very specifically up to the last <span class="SpellE">centares</span>,
</span><span style="">so t</span><span style="">hat an error or discrepancy of 500 hectares
shown in a</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">resurvey made years later was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">considered
as not plausible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;"><span style="">Fourthly,
private respondent Jose Gomez admitted that there is a discrepancy between </span><span style="">tax </span><span style="">declaration No. 27848 and plan Psu-114232 prepared in 1941 for <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> Gomez attached to
the application for registration (TSN, Sept. 10, 1963 p. 146).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, Psu-114232 does not bear
the approval of the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is already settled that survey plan not approved by the Director of

trace their right over the property by inheritance, died <span style="">in </span>1910 (TSN, Nov. 20, 1962; p. 4; TSN
June 18, 1963; p. <span style="">63; TSN, Sept. 10,

could not have converted the </span>same into a record of ownership twenty
years after.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Royal
Decree of <st1:date year="1894" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1894</st1:date>
known as the Maura Law, which granted the right to perfect <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>

over the land reverted to the government and the right of the cultivator and
possessor to obtain gratuitous title was extinguished (<span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
v. Insular Government, 40 Phil. 267 [1919]; Director of Lands v. Reyes, 68 SCRA
177 [1975]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore,
indisputable that the registration of possession had not been converted into a
registration of ownership in accord</span>a<span style="">nce with <span class="SpellE">ArticIe</span> 393 of the Spanish Mortgage
Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, private respondents
do not possess a <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> title (Fernandez</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">Hermanos</span></span><span style=""> v. Director of Lands, </span><u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As
held by this Court, failure to perform all conditions essential to a government
grant does not entitle an</span> applicant to confirmation <span style="">of </span>an imperfect title (Director <span style="">of </span><span style="">Lands v. <span class="SpellE">Datu</span>, 115 SCRA 25 [1982]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, the </span><span class="SpellE"><b style="">titulo</b></span><b style=""> de </b><span class="SpellE"><b style=""><span style="">informacion</span></b></span><b style=""><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span></span></b><span style=""> </span><span style="">in
the instant case may provide a</span> <b style=""><span style="">prima facie</span></b> <span style="">evidence of the fact that at the time of its
execution the predecessors-in-interest of claimants were in possession of the
property covered, which may possibly be converted into ownership by
uninterrupted possession for the statutory period (<span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
v. Insular Government, <u>supra</u>; Republic v. IAC, 148 SCRA 480 [1987]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;">Aside from the fact that such
uninterrupted possession <span style="">for the</span>
statutory period required was not successfully <span style="">established, no possession or claim of ownership on the lands in
question can vest title on the private respondents, it being indisputable that
they are public lands or parcels of land within the forest zone, not subject to</span>
<span style="">private appropriation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;">The whole mass of land <span style="">b</span>eing claimed by private respondents,
is within <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Manleluag</span>
Reforestation as appearing </span>in <span style="">the
</span>plan of <span style="">the </span>Reforestation
Administration, s<span style="">howing </span>the<span style=""> relative position of the area claimed in
relation to a portion of the Project</span> (Original<span style=""> Record with Exhibits, p. 502) yet, as testified to by Domingo G.
Madrid who headed the Project </span>when <span style="">it
was first established in</span> <span style="">the
early part of 1938, neither the </span>original <span style="">applicant </span>Eugenia <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Soriano</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Gomez nor her husband when
he was still alive in 1938, ever went to his office to complain about the
establishment of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Baloloc</span>
Subsidiary </span>Nursery in the area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, said witness recalled having had a <span style="">conversation </span>with Atty. Gomez but the latter never made any
mention about claiming an area covered by the <span class="SpellE">Manleluag</span>
<span style="">Reforestation Project (TSN, </span>Sept.
12<span style="">, </span><span style="">1967, pp. 230-235).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The works
were undertaken for a period of almost two years without any objection from
anyone (TSN, </span><b style=""><span style="">ibid</span></b><span style="">., </span><span style="">p. 239).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> Rosario, the representative of private respondents
during the ocular inspection, admitted knowing about the existence of the <span class="SpellE">Balococ</span> Subsidiary Nursery in the area having himself
worked with the <span class="SpellE">Manleluag</span> Reforestation Project when
it was being administered by Domingo Madrid, and even planted some of the
seedlings within the area (Ocular Inspection, March 17, 1967, pp. 184-185)
raises doubts </span><span style="">as to the </span><span style="">continuous possession of the land by private
respondents' predecessors-in-interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it is axiomatic that forest lands of the public </span><span style="">domain </span><span style="">cannot be acquired
