Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, armed with a bolo, with intent to kill and with evident premeditation

<p class="BODY">The People's version of the facts is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Alfredo "Boy" Fernandez was on his way home at <span class="SpellE">aroud</span> 7:00 o'clock in the evening of July 25, 1981 after
paying a visit to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ayap</span> and his wife, Angelina de Vera.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few minutes after he left, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> went to the kitchen to close the window
shutters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While doing so, he saw Alfredo
walking towards the bridge fronting his house which was only 30 meters away; he
was obviously unaware that someone who was holding a bolo, followed close­ly
behind him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
immediately recognized him to be Rafael "<span class="SpellE">Rafy</span>"
<span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He and
his family had known him since he was a small boy and since his house was
situated about 80 meters away from <span class="SpellE">Prudencio's</span> house
at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Portic</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bugallon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and some­times
they even saw each other twice a week because of the proximity of their houses
(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 11, 1982, pp. 35- 36; <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
May 26, 1982, p. 6).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden as
Alfredo was nearing the foot of the bridge, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
saw accused hack him at the back (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 12, 1982,
p. 15) with his 16 inch-bolo (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 11, 1982, p.
43).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
saw accused hack him twice with his bolo although he did not know how many
times thereafter he might have hacked him (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May
11, 1982, p. 40) because he had by then rushed downstairs to call for his son
who was under the house (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 26, 1982, p.
10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Realizing that Alfredo's life might
be in danger, they hurried towards the bridge; it did not take <span class="GramE">them</span> three minutes to reach a distance of from 12 to 15
meters from the bridge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rafael was by
then on the other side of the creek but Alfredo "Boy" was nowhere in
sight (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, p. 10, id).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Brandishing his bolo, Rafael threatened them
thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="GramE">If</span> you
will reveal what happened to any­one, I will kill both of you.’ <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 11, 1982, p. 41; <span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 12, 1982, p. 5).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fearing for their lives, they ran towards
their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They remained there only
for the night because the next day, without reporting the matter to the police <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">because </span>of the acts of the accused,
they went up to the mountains to get rattan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was only three days later that they came down; they found out that
Alfredo "Boy" was dead (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 12, 1982,
p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A total of 13 wounds were found
on his body (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 11, 1982, p. 6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to him, the wounds could have only been inflicted by a
sharp bladed weapon such as a bolo (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 11,
1982, pp. 11-19).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Investigation would reveal that the accused nurtured a grudge
against the victim for the latter's refusal to join his <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span>
in stealing cows (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 26, 1982, pp. 42-43).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Earlier on <st1:date month="6" day="26" year="1981">June 26, 1981</st1:date>, while the victim, Jose <span class="SpellE">Viliran</span> and his com­panions were constructing a shade for
his sister's wedding, accused sent his brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>,
to call Alfredo because he wanted to tell him some­thing (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
May 26, 1982, p. 32).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Alfredo
ignored <span class="SpellE">Dumlao's</span> command, he sent another person to
call him but the victim stood pat on his decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failing to get Alfredo to come to him,
accused himself went up to their construction place and asked him to explain
his refusal to heed him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fired <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with anger, accused called him 'arrogant' (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, p. 34, id) and made Alfredo understand that he can
never forget the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon <span class="SpellE">Viliran's</span> intervention, a possible en­counter failed to
materialize.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused left the place but
came back 15 minutes later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He followed
the workers who were going up the house and brought along his bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He challenged Alfredo anew and when the
latter refused, he took hold of his hair and knocked his head against the wall
(<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, p. 35, id).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Alfredo would not budge and instead pleaded with him to stop
hurting him, accused grabbed Alfredo's right hand and punched the latter's face
with it (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, id, p. 36).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failing to elicit a favorable response to his
challenge, he shifted his concentration on <span class="SpellE">Viliran</span>
and challenged him instead but </span>the latter refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Definitely enraged, he went down­stairs and
said 'I will never forget this incident' (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May
26, 1982, p. 37).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo might have had
a pre­sentiment about what will later on befall him because when accused had <span class="GramE">left,</span> he told <span class="SpellE">Viliran</span> that should
he die other than by natural death, the accused will be the one responsible for
it (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, id).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was only five months later, when <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
and Albino found out that Rafael had taken residence in another barrio, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Cayanga</span>, that they were able to summon enough courage to
give their state<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ments about the
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="12" day="21" year="1981"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the 21st of
 December, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> gave his statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

G. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>, May 27,

likewise transferred his house to a land owned by his wife (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>,
May 12, 1982, p. 15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when
photo­graphs of the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the crime were taken on <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="6">June 19, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, a year had passed since the incident took

place." <span class="GramE">(Brief, pp. 3-7.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The appeal raises two
questions, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether or not <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> killed Alfredo Fernandez and, if he did, should the
crime be denomi­nated as murder or homicide only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Anent the first question,
<span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ayap</span> and his son,

testimony of the father and his son and <span class="GramE">We</span> see no
reason to disturb the finding for it was able to observe the demeanor of the
witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that the
appellant was well-known to the witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant and the witnesses not only lived in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is true that the <span class="SpellE">Ayaps</span> did not report the incident until late in December

"If you reveal what happened to anyone, I will kill both of you." <span class="GramE">(TSN, May 11, 1982, p. 41.)</span> But when the <span class="SpellE">Ayaps</span>

was killed cannot be taken seriously for the following reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. He was positively identified by the <span class="SpellE">Ayaps</span>
as the killer of Fernandez and he has not <span class="SpellE">satisfatorily</span>

was not physically impossible for him to have gone to the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The remaining question is
whether the appellant committed the crime of murder or homicide only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The information alleges
the qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation and superiority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial court that the record
does not support these allegations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court, however, still convicted <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> of
murder because, to use its words, "the victim Alfredo Fernandez, was
hacked <u>from behind</u>, in a <u>sudden</u>, <u>unexpected</u>, and,
therefore, <u>treacherous</u> manner."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Assuming for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sake </span>of argument that treachery was
present when <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> killed Fernandez, it cannot
qualify the crime as murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
treachery is not alleged in the information as a qualifying circumstance and it
is well-settled that, "A qualifying circumstance not alleged in the information
or complaint, although proven, may only be con­sidered as an aggravating
circumstance, but not to qualify the offense charged." <span class="GramE">(People

<blockquote>"Evidently the foregoing declaration of <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ayap</span> [that Alfredo Fernandez was hacked at the back]
is false because Dr. Armando Canto testified that all the 13 wounds were in­flicted
on the left side of the body (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>-pp. 20-21, May 11,
1982); that if the assailant is a right-handed man, all the wounds were
inflicted in a frontal attack (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>-p. 27, May 11,
1982); but if he is a left-handed man, the wounds would be on the right side of
the body (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>-pp. 27-28, May 11, 1982); Now, the
conclusion is inescapable that the assailant must have been a right-handed man
because all the 13 wounds were inflicted on the left side of the body; and that
said wounds were inflicted in a frontal attack, according to Dr. Canto in his testimony."
