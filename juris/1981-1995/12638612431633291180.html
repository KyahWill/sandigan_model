set aside the judgment of public respondent Court of Appeals dated May 8, 1987 which
affirmed the trial court's decision finding petitioner guilty of violation of
Presidential Decree No. 772 (Anti-Squatting Law) and sentencing him to suffer
imprisonment for one (1) year, with the accessories provided by law and to
remove the house constructed on the land in question within thirty (30) days
from the finality of judgment, otherwise, private respondent University of the
Philippines was authorized to demolish or dismantle the house at the expense of
the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are not disputed.</p>

in the morning of <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1984</st1:date>,
the desk officer of the U.P. Police Force received a telephone call; the caller
reported that somebody was constructing a house at the U.P. Arboretum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Villanueva, <span class="SpellE">Ladip</span>
and Ernesto were directed to investigate (pp. 4-5, TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1985</st1:date>; p. 4, TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1985</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Ladip</span> are members of the
U.P. Police Force connected or assigned with the U.P. Squatter's Relocation
Team.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The U.P. Arboretum is located at the back of the U.P. <span class="SpellE">Petron</span>, beside the <st1:place><st1:placename>U.P.</st1:placename>

 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> (p. 5, TSN, June 21, 1985).</blockquote>

<blockquote>They proceeded to said place and there they <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

and were told that the accused, <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is the </span>owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Ocampo</span></span> who was present at the
time, was asked whether he had a building permit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused admitted that he had no building
permit, although he claimed that he bought the parcel of land on which his
house was being constructed from a certain <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Roberto <span class="SpellE">Pael</span> </span>(p. 5, TSN, July 22, 1985;
p. 6, TSN, June 21, 1985).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused was informed that the land belongs to the University of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and that he should stop the construction of his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused complied (pp. 6-7, TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1985</st1:date>; p. 6, TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1985</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, on <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="8">August 24,
 1984</st1:date>, the accused resumed the construction of his aforesaid
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span>
prosecution witnesses reminded the accused that he was violating Presidential
Decree No. 772 (pp. 7-8, TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="6">June 21,
 1985</st1:date>; pp. 6-7, TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="7">July
 22, 1985</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused was again told to stop the construction of his
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused ignored the U.P.
Police Squatter's Team, and insisted that he bought the land from Mr. <span class="SpellE">Pael</span> (p. 9, TSN, July 22, 1985; p. 10, TSN, June 21, 1985).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The team reported the matter to their Chief, Captain Madrigal, and
executed an affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A") which they
submitted to the U.P. Legal Department (p. 9, TSN, July 22, 1985; p. 10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 21, 1985).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The trial court denied
the motion to dismiss for lack of merit, arriving at the following conclusion:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The prosecution did not present in evidence Transfer

considered view of this Court, did not cripple the fact that the accused, <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, is not the owner
of said property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since there is no
showing that the accused occupied the lot in question and constructed his
residential house thereat with the knowledge and/or consent of the owner
thereof, the accused is a squatter within the contemplation of Presidential
Decree No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">772.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1985</st1:date>,
the trial court found <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused then appealed to the Court of Appeals alleging that the
trial court erred in:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) applying
Section 15, Rule 119 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure; (b) convicting
appellant on the basis of evidence which does not measure to the degree of
proof as required by law; and (c) not applying the principle of presumption of
innocence in favor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower
court, finding said appealed decision to be in accordance with law and
supported by evidence as well.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, accused-appellant filed the instant petition for review on
<i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, two issues are presented involving purely
questions of law:</p>

<p class="2Q">"1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
failure of the prosecution to present evidence of ownership is not a fatal
defect in finding the accused?petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt
of the crime of squatting; and</p>

<p class="2Q">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is the Motion to Dismiss
filed by accused-petitioner a bar for him to present evidence?"</p>

<p class="BODY">For failure of the petitioner to file his reply within the period
which expired on <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1987</st1:date>,
this Court, in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="3" month="2">February
 3, 1988</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">resolved</span> to dispense with the
aforesaid reply and considered the case submitted for deliberation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleges that the very essence of the case is the proof
of ownership of the land involved herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We do not agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law involved in this case is Section 1 of Presidential Decree
No. 772, otherwise known as the Anti-Squatting Law, which embraces three (3)
elements, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) accused is not the
owner of the land; (b) that he succeeded in occupying or possessing the
property through force, intimidation, or threat or by taking advantage of the
absence or tolerance of the owner; and (c) such occupation of the property is
without the consent or against the will<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>of
the owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the case
at bar, all three (3) elements have been established beyond reasonable doubt.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence presented by the prosecution manifested that <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> was not the owner
of the land on which he constructed his house and that he did so against the
owner's will <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">or </span>without its
consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prosecution witnesses testified
that as early as May, 1983, petitioner was told that the area is U.P. property;
that he began constructing his house without a permit from the owner; that
petitioner had no building permit and that he had been informed that he was
violating the Anti-Squatting Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, it was also confirmed that petitioner had never shown title to
the land he claims to have purchased from one Roberto <span class="SpellE">Pael</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, he failed to present any deed of sale or
any title in his name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This alleged sale
is a defense which the petitioner could have successfully utilized to his
advantage but failed to substantiate it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">with
</span>evidence at the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
petitioner moved for dismissal of the case, he forfeited his chance to prove
his claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted also that
this Roberto <span class="SpellE">Pael</span> was shown by testimonial evidence
to be not the owner of the land and that said land is the subject of a criminal
case against <span class="SpellE">Pael</span> for squatting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither did the petitioner exhibit any building or sanitary
permit to the U.P.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Security
Force or in court, such being attached only to his motion for reconsideration.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Worthy of note is the fact that such permits
are both dated <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1985</st1:date>,
which is more than ten (10) months after the illegal <span class="GramE">construction</span>
took place and three (3) months after the case had been filed against
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">We concur with the Court of Appeals in affirming the trial
court's decision which maintained that the failure of the prosecution to
present title to prove ownership by the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of the land in question is not material in proving the guilt of the petitioner
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ownership
of U.P. is not in issue in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Withal, the property has been widely and publicly known to be part of
the U.P. grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crucial issue is
the act of squatting of the petitioner and his non-ownership of the property,
both of which have been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regard the second issue presented, the answer is in the
affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 15, Rule 119 of the
Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, provides:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:1.8pt"><span class="GramE">"Section 15.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Demurrer to Evidence.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the prosecution has rested its case,
the court may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">dismiss </span>the case
on the ground of insufficiency of evidence (1) on its own initiative after
giving the prosecution an opportunity to be heard; or (2) on motion of the
accused filed with prior leave of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amendment to Section 15, Rule 119 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal
Procedure took effect only on <st1:date year="1988" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1988</st1:date>, but the same was given <span class="GramE">retroactive</span>
effect in the case of <span class="SpellE">Bonalos</span> vs. People, in its
resolution dated, <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is the rule that "statutes

120 SCRA 522).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amendment would
therefore apply in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, nowhere does the record show that
accused-petitioner's demurrer to evidence was filed with prior leave of court,
the retroactive effect of the amendment <span class="SpellE">aforesated</span>
would therefore work against herein petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">By moving to dismiss on the ground of insufficiency of evidence,
accused-petitioner waives his right to present evidence to substantiate his
defense and in effect submits the case for Judgment on the basis of the
evidence for the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
exactly what petitioner did, and he cannot now claim denial of his right to
adduce his own evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
Solicitor General aptly opined, "petitioner gambled on securing an
acquittal, a gamble which he lost." (pp. 31-32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">More than that, petitioner <span class="GramE">raises</span> as
issue whether his motion to dismiss bars him from presenting his evidence, but
nowhere in his petition does he endeavor to argue in his favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a question should have been raised by
the petitioner in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> and on appeal yet he failed to
do the same.</p>
