<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In 1941, Farmlot No. 2113
(formerly No. 1295) with an area of 12 hectares, more or less, located at
Aquino Gate, Polomolok, Cotabato (the Farmlot, for short), was allocated to
GORGONIO Munez, as a settler, by the National Land Settlement Administration
(Exhibit "2").  After
liberation, however, because of lack of water, GORGONIO abandoned the Farmlot
and left for Davao leaving it under the care of EUGENIO Munez, his uncle.  In 1949, the Farmlot was allocated to
EUGENIO by the National Land Settlement Administration (Exhibits "A",
"B", "C", "D", "E" and
"G").  In 1955, GORGONIO
returned to Polomolok, Cotabato and to the Farmlot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On January 23, 1957,
GORGONIO, as the original awardee, and EUGENIO, as the subsequent allocatee,
executed in favor of</span> petitioner, an Affidavit of Transfer of Rights over
the Farmlot for P600.00 plus the assumption of all subsisting obligations with
the National Land Settlement Administration.  Said Affidavit reads in full as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The document was subscribed and sworn to before Notary Public
Bautista B. Casquejo at General Santos, Cotabato.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 2, 1958, petitioner filed an application for Free Patent
with the Bureau of Lands specifically naming "GORGONIO MUNEZ and EUGENIO
MUNEZ" as his predecessors and attaching the Affidavit of Transfer of
Rights in his favor.  On May 3, 1958,
Notice of Application for Free Patent was given, copy of which was "posted
in a conspicuous place on the land applied for, on the bulletin board of the
barrio where the land is located and at the door of the Municipal Building, and
remained so posted until the 16th day of May, 1958" (Exhibit
"J").  On August 18, 1959,
petitioner declared that Farmlot for taxation purposes and on August 31, 1959,
he paid the real property taxes.  He
also planted mango trees and other seasonal products such as rice, corn and
potatoes on the said Farmlot.  In 1964,
he constructed an apartment worth between P20,000.00 and P30,000.00.  And on April 26, 1965, he paid for the
balance of the account of GORGONIO in the amount of P445.14, this time, with
the Board of Liquidators.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that sometime in January 1965, EUGENIO's children went
to the Bureau of Lands to verify the status of the Farmlot and allegedly to
their surprise, they discovered that GORGONIO and EUGENIO had purportedly
executed an Affidavit of Transfer of Rights in petitioner's favor and that
based thereon, the latter had filed an application for Free Patent for the
Farmlot through fraud and misrepresentation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On March 1, 1965,
claiming fraud in that the document </span>to which he affixed his thumbmark on
January 23, 1957 was only a contract of lease and not a transfer of rights,
EUGENIO and his spouse Victoria, filed a Complaint for Annulment of Contract
and Recovery of Possession and Damages against petitioner before the then Court
of First Instance in South Cotabato, docketed as Civil Case No. 568.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Upon
the death of the spouses, their heirs, herein private respondents, were
substituted in their stead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 6, 1965, the Director of Lands approved petitioner's
application for Free Patent and directed the issuance of Patent No. 300666 in
petitioner's favor (Exhibits "J", "K", "L-3",
"4" and "2-A").  On
May 31, 1965, Original Certificate of Title No. P-25722 was issued in
petitioner's name by the Register of Deeds of Cotabato.  (Exhibit "5").</p>

<p class="BODY">Having become aware of the issuance of that title, private
respondents filed another Complaint on September 22, 1965, this time for
Reconveyance and/or Declaration of Nullity of OCT No. P-9882 (P-25722) and/or
Cancellation of Title and Damages against petitioner, docketed as Civil Case
No. 1084.</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving the twin cases, on June 29, 1971, the Trial Court
dismissed both Complaints finding that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">transaction between petitioner, on the one hand, and </span>GORGONIO
and EUGENIO, on the other, was in reality one of sale and not of lease since,
if it were the latter, respondents would have demanded payment of the rental or
sued petitioner for unlawful detainer for non-payment of rent; that it would
have been absurd for petitioner, who is a medical practitioner, if the land had
only been leased to him,  to have
planted on the land fruit trees like mangoes, and to have constructed an
apartment worth between P20,000.00 and P30,000.00; that assuming the existence
of fraud in the transaction, the cause of action had prescribed because private
respondent could have discovered the fraud at least in 1958 when petitioner
failed to pay the rent; that the Complaint was filed only on March 1, 1965, or
more than four (4) years from 1958, which is beyond the four-year-period
prescribed by law; that granting that prescription does not lie, the cause of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">action is barred by laches as, over an
eight-year-period, private respondents never demanded the payment of rental
from petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On appeal, however,
respondent Appellate Court</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> reversed the lower Court on the ground that
the Affidavit of Transfer of Rights allegedly executed by GORGONIO and EUGENIO

Commonwealth Act No. 691</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> nor by the Secretary of Labor under Act No.

mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">; that the said Affidavit was not intended to
be </span>a transfer of rights but as a contract of lease; that there is no
showing that the document <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>actually
interpreted to EUGENIO, he being an illiterate; that the Affidavit states that
GORGONIO and EUGENIO are brothers when, in truth and in fact, they are nephew
and uncle, respectively; that if the Affidavit had been properly read to
EUGENIO and he had actually understood it that error could have been corrected
by him; that the claim of prescription will not prosper because the defense of
non-existence of contract does not prescribe; that the doctrine of
indefeasibility of title does not  operate because the certificate of title was issued on the basis of a
fraudulent document and both title and the free patent were issued while the
case was pending and the respective rights of the parties had not yet been
judicially determined.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We are constrained to
reverse, finding as we do no basis to support the Appellate Court conclusion
that the agreement entered into between petitioner, on the one hand, and
GORGONIO and EUGENIO, on the other, was one of lease and not a sale.  The Affidavit of Transfer of Rights executed
by the latter two is unambiguous and requires no interpretation.  It was executed regularly with the
formalities required by law.  It had a
valid consideration - the amount of P600.00 and the assumption of all
obligations which remained unpaid by GORGONIO with the Land Settlement
Administration, later the Board of Liquidators.  If the agreement had been one of lease, rentals should have been
demanded by GORGONIO and EUGENIO during the span of eight (8) years from 1957,
the year of the execution of the agreement, to 1965 when the first suit for
annulment of contract against petitioner was filed but neither GORGONIO </span>nor
EUGENIO ever did.  As opined by the
Trial Court, either one or both of them could have instituted an action for
unlawful detainer based on the alleged contract of lease for non-payment of
rent, but did not.  Their inaction or
silence betrays the emptiness of their claim.  We find it likewise significant that GORGONIO, the original awardee, did
not join EUGENIO in his suit against petitioner, which would have been only
logical if, in reality, transfer of rights over the Farmlot in question was but
fiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, the assignment of rights to petitioner had not been
priorly approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.  Under the environmental circumstances,
however, it may not be declared void <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u>.  The Affidavit of Transfer of Rights was
before the said official when petitioner filed his Application for Free
Patent.  In fact, that Affidavit formed
the basis of petitioner's Application for Free Patent (Exhibit "I"
and "3").  Said official, who
took over from the Board of Liquidators the function of disposing of the farm
lots in the settlement area where the Farmlot is situated, could have voided
the transfer and caused the cancellation of the Application for Free Patent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">outright, </span>but did not.  Instead, the very same official, who was to
pass upon the Transfer of Rights, approved, signed and issued petitioner's Free
Patent Application based thereon and authorized the issuance of title in petitioner's
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The agreement in question not having been void <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u>,
the action for annulment of contract on the ground of fraud was not
imprescriptible.  It had to be filed
within four (4) years from the discovery of the fraud (Art. 1391, Civil Code),
in this case, within four (4) years from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">execution of the contract in 1957 since EUGENIO alleges that it did not
reflect the true intention of the parties, or, as the Trial Court had found, at
least from 1958 when their "supposed lessor did not pay the rental",
or from May </span>16, 1958, the last day of posting of the Notice of
Application, or from August 18, 1959 when petitioner registered the document as
a pre-requisite before he was issued a tax declaration.  Registration is notice to the whole world
and private respondents must be deemed to have acquired construct<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">ive</span> notice, at the very least, by the
registration of the document.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> In
this case, suit was instituted only in 1965 way beyond the four-year period
prescribed by law reckoned from any of the dates previously mentioned.  EUGENIO's illiteracy would not alter this
conclusion inasmuch as he did not execute the Affidavit singly but jointly with
GORGONIO, who neither raised any voice of protest.  Besides, private respondents never rebutted petitioner's testimony
that at the time of the execution of the Transfer of Rights before the Notary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Public, GORGONIO and EUGENIO were with him
and were relating with the Notary Public in the Visayan dialect, but which
petitioner did not understand.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> It can be assumed that prior to
notarization, the Notary Public, in the regular performance of his duties,
would have verified from the affiants themselves the veracity of the contents
of their Affidavit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Laches must also deemed
to have set in as the law protects only the vigilant.  Unreasonable delay in seeking to enforce </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">right
is not only persuasive of want of merit but may, according to the circumstance,
be destructive of the right itself.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> For eight (8) years from the execution of

institution of the first suit.  Neither
EUGENIO nor his heirs declared the land for taxation purposes or pay the taxes
thereon.  Nor were GORGONIO and EUGENIO
settlers in point of fact.  GORGONIO
himself testified that after he returned to Polomolok in 1955, he rented out
the Farmlot to one Monte Alto in 1956, and after him to Mr. Abria.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the time when the first suit was instituted, must have revived and spurred
EUGENIO's interest in the property, hence, his attempt to repudiate the clear
