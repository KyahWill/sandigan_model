they are non-existent. As aptly put in American Jurisprudence, "a void
judgment is not entitled to the respect accorded to a valid judg­ment, but may
be entirely disregarded or declared inope­rative by any tribunal in which
effect is sought to be given to it. It is attended by none of the consequences
of a valid adjudication. It has no legal or binding effect or efficacy for any
purpose or at any place. It cannot affect, impair or create rights. It is not
en­titled to enforcement and is, ordinarily, no protection to those who seek to
enforce. All proceedings founded on the void judgment are themselves regarded
as invalid. In other words, a void judgment is regarded as a nullity, and the
situation is the same as it would be if there <span class="GramE">were no
judgment</span>. It, accordingly, leaves the parties litigants in the same
position they were in before the trial."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<blockquote>"The first lesson to be drawn here is that courts must exercise
the <u>greatest</u> caution in entertaining such petitions for reconstitution
of allegedly lost cer­tificates of title, particularly where the petitions are
filed, as in this case, after an inexplicable delay of 25 years after the
alleged loss. Furthermore, the courts must likewise make sure that <u>indispensable
parties</u>, i.e., <u>the actual owners</u> <u>and possessors</u> of the lands
in­volved, are duly served <u>with</u> <u>actual and </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">personal </span>notice</u> of the petition (<u>not</u>
<u>by</u> <u>mere</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">general</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <u>publication</u>), particularly </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">where the lands involved consti­tute prime
developed commercial land ... The stability and indefeasibility of </span>the
Torrens System would have been greatly imperiled had the appellate court's judg­ment
granting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">reconstitution </span>prevailed,
resulting in two holders of Torrens cer­tificates over the same lands. We can
take judicial notice of innumerable liti­gations and controversies that have
been spawned by the reckless and hasty grant of such reconstitution of alleged
lost or destroyed titles as well as the nume­rous purchasers who have been
victimized only to find that the 'lands' purchased by them were covered by
forged or fake titles or their areas simply 'expanded' through 'table surveys'
with the coope­ration of unscrupulous officials.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">stresses </span>once
more that lands already covered by duly issued exist­ing <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
titles cannot be the subject of petitions for <u>reconstitution</u> of
allegedly lost or destroyed titles filed by <u>third</u> <u>parties</u> <u>without</u>
<u>first</u> securing by final judgment the <u>cancellation</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">of s</span>uch existing titles. The courts
simply<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt"> </span>have <u>no</u> <u>jurisdiction</u>
over petitions by such <u>third</u> <u>parties</u> for <u>reconstitution</u> of
allegedly lost or destroyed titles over lands that are <u>already covered by
duly issued subsisting titles</u> in the names of their duly registered owners.
The very concept of <u>stability</u> and <u>indefeasibility</u> of titles
covered under the Torrens System registration rules out as anathema the
issuance of two certificates of title over the same land to two different
holders thereof. <u>A</u> <u>fortiori</u>, such proceedings for
'reconstitution' with­out actual notice to the duly registered owners and
holders of Torrens <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Titles </span>to the
land are null and void. Applicants, land officials and judges who disregard
