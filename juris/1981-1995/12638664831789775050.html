and that the judgment debt sought to be enforced against the family home of defendant is not one of those enumerated under Article 155 of the Family Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the agricultural land although it is declared in the name of defendant it is alleged to be still part of the public land and the transfer in his favor by the original possessor and applicant who was a member of a cultural minority was not approved by the proper government agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An opposition thereto was filed by the plaintiffs.</p> <p class="BODY">In an order dated August 26, 1988, the trial court denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration thereof was filed by defendant and this was denied for lack of merit on September 2, 1988.</p> <p class="BODY">Hence, the herein petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> wherein it is alleged that the trial court erred and acted in excess of its jurisdiction in denying petitioner’s motion to quash and/or to set aside levy on the properties and in denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration of the order dated August 26, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends that only a question of law is involved in this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asserts that the residential house and lot was first occupied as his family residence in 1969 and was duly constituted as a family home under the Family Code which took effect on August 4, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, petitioner argues that the said residential house and lot is exempt from payment of the obligation enumerated in Article 155 of the Family Code; and that the decision in this case pertaining to damages arising from a vehicular accident took place on March 16, 1976 and which became final in 1988 is not one of those instances enumerated under Article 155 of the Family Code when the family home may be levied upon and sold on execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further alleged that the trial court erred in holding that the said house and lot became a family home only on August 4, 1988 when the Family Code became effective, and that the Family Code cannot be interpreted in such a way that all family residences are deemed to have been constituted as family homes at the time of their occupancy prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the said Code and that they are exempt from execution for the payment of obligations incurred before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said Code; and that it also erred when it declared that Article 162 of the Family Code does not state that the provisions of Chapter 2, Title V have a retroactive effect.</p> <p class="BODY">Articles 152 and 153 of the Family Code provide as follows:</p> <blockquote>“Art. 152.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family home, constituted jointly by the husband and the wife or by an unmarried head of a family, is the dwelling house where they and their family reside, and the land on which it is situated.”</blockquote> <blockquote>“Art. 153.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family home is deemed constituted on a house and lot from the time it is occupied as a family residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the time of its constitution and so long as any of its beneficiaries actually resides therein, the family home continues to be such and is exempt from execution, forced sale or attachment except as hereinafter provided and to the extent of the value allowed by law.”</blockquote> <p class="BODY">Under the Family Code, a family home is deemed constituted on a house and lot from the time it is occupied as a family residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no need to constitute the same judicially or <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> as required in the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the family actually resides in the premises, it is, therefore, a family home as contemplated by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the creditors should take the necessary precautions to protect their interest before extending credit to the spouses or head of the family who owns the home.</p> <p class="BODY">Article 155 of the Family Code also provides as follows:</p> <blockquote>“Art. 155.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family home shall be exempt from execution, forced sale or attachment except:</blockquote> <blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For nonpayment of taxes;</blockquote> <blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For debts incurred prior to the constitution of the family home;<sup><o:p></o:p></sup></blockquote> <blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For debts secured by mortgages on the premises before or after such constitution; and<sup><o:p></o:p></sup></blockquote> <blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For debts due to laborers, mechanics, architects, builders, <span class="SpellE">materialmen</span> and others who have rendered service or furnished material for the construction of the building.”</blockquote> <p class="BODY">The exemption provided as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> is effective from the time of the constitution of the family home as such, and lasts so long as any of its beneficiaries actually resides therein.</p> <p class="BODY">In the present case, the residential house and lot of petitioner was not constituted as a family home whether judicially or <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> under the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became a family home by operation of law only under Article 153 of the Family Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is deemed constituted as a family home upon the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Family Code on August 3, 1988 not August 4, one year after its publication in the Manila Chronicle on August 4, 1987 (1988 being a leap year).</p> <p class="BODY">The contention of petitioner that it should be considered a family home from the time it was occupied by petitioner and his family in 1969 is not well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 162 of the Family Code, it is provided that “the provisions of this Chapter shall also govern existing family residences insofar as said provisions are applicable.” It does not mean that Articles 152 and 153 of said Code have a retroactive effect such that all existing family residences are deemed to have been constituted as family homes at the time of their occupation prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Family Code and are exempt from execution for the payment of obligations incurred before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Family Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 162 simply means that all existing family residences at the time of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Family Code, are considered family homes and are prospectively entitled to the benefits accorded to a family home under the Family Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 162 does not state that the provisions of Chapter 2, Title V have a retroactive effect.</p> <p class="BODY">Is the family home of petitioner exempt from execution of the money judgment <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The debt or liability which was the basis of the judgment arose or was incurred at the time of the vehicular accident on March 16, 1976 and the money judgment arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was rendered by the appellate court on January 29, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both preceded the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Family Code on August 3, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case does not fall under the exemptions from execution provided in the Family Code.</p> <p class="BODY">As to the agricultural land subject of the execution, the trial court correctly ruled that the levy to be made by the sheriff shall be on whatever rights the petitioner may have on the land.</p> <p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</p> <b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br> <span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Narvasa</span>, (Chairman), Cruz, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Medialdea</span>, JJ., <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br> <span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Griño-Aquino</span>, J., <span style="font-style: normal;">on leave.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br> <br><br><hr align="left" size="1" width="33%"> <!--[endif]--> <p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> Madame Justice Lorna S. <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span>-de la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> was the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>, concurred in by Justices Antonio M.
