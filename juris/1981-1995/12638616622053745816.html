<p class="BODY">Appellant Johnson <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> used to stay

the three proceeded to the house of the victim who was living alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> carried a

</span>In the course of the questioning, the station commander noticed the

Upon initial inquiry, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> readily admitted his
participation in the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> also admitted his complicity but he
pointed to <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> as the one who struck the victim

hospital where he accompanied the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the initial stage of the investigation, he denied any
participation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he eventually
admitted his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1984</st1:date>,
the police conducted a thorough investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

During the preliminary examination conducted by Judge Francisco <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> of the Municipal Circuit Court of Carmen, <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> on <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="4">April

<p class="BODY">Thus, an information for murder was filed by the provincial
fiscal of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place> against said
three suspects in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment of the three accused on <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1984</st1:date>, they entered a plea of not
guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were assisted by their
respective counsels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the case was
set for trial on the merits on <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="7">July
 25, 1984</st1:date>, counsel for the accused <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lapaz</span> informed the trial court that he would like to
change his plea of not guilty to that of guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court inquired from the accused if
he confirms the manifestation of his counsel and he answered in the
affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, said accused
was re-arraigned whereupon he pleaded guilty to the crime charged against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court again asked the accused
whether he confirms the manifestation of his lawyer that he was changing his
previous plea of not guilty to that of guilty considering that the crime
charged is a capital offense and the answer of the accused was still in the
affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court also asked
him whether he understood fully well the explanation of his lawyer as to the
nature of the charges against him and the consequences of his plea of guilty to
the crime charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The answer of the
accused was also in the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
this juncture, his counsel invoked two mitigating circumstances in favor of the
accused, to wit: (1) voluntary plea of guilty; and (2) voluntary
surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal did not offer any
objection to the appreciation of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary plea
of guilty but he submitted to the sound discretion of the trial court the
appreciation of the second mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He informed the trial court that the accused
was apprehended a few minutes after the commission of the offense and was in
the custody of the police before the filing of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court required the prosecution to present Dr. Elizabeth
<span class="SpellE">Cabagnot</span> in order to determine the extent of injuries
suffered by the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1984</st1:date> a decision was
promulgated by the trial court convicting the accused <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lapaz</span> alias "Toto" of the crime of
murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the two aggravating
circumstances charged in the information, namely: (1) disregard of the respect
due to the offended party on account of her age and sex and (2) the crime
having been committed in the dwelling place of the offended party without the
latter having given provocation, and which is offset by one mitigating
circumstance of voluntary plea of guilty, the accused was sentenced to suffer
the penalty of death and to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Eulalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabunag</span> in the amount of P12,000.00 with subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the trial proceeded as against appellant <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapaz</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
fiscal filed a motion to discharge the accused <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
as a state witness with the conformity of the said accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was granted by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the trial on the merits, a decision was
rendered by the trial court on February 28, 1985 finding the accused <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> guilty of the crime of murder, with three
aggravating circumstances, namely: (a) disregard of sex and age of the victim;
(b) committed at the dwelling place of the victim; and (c) committed at
nighttime and by gaining access to the victim's dwelling through an opening not
intended for egress; <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., through a hole made by the accused,
without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court imposed on him the penalty of
death, to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P12,000.00, and
required him to pay the heirs of the victim the actual damage of P10,000.00
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs of
the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both cases were elevated to this Court on automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused Johnson <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> with the

there is no more automatic review of cases of this nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These cases are thus treated as on ordinary

Johnson <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> stresses the fact that his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapaz</span>, who took the

because <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> threatened him with a hunting
knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span>
admitted that his relationship with the victim was not cordial, he alleges that
his anger never developed into such hatred as to inspire him to kill the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends that his mere
presence on the occasion of the killing does not prove conspiracy inasmuch as
he did not take a direct part in the beating of the victim and that he did not
directly force or induce <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> to commit the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He argues that if at all, his
participation was merely that of an accomplice in that knowing of the criminal
design of <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> he still accompanied said
assailant to the place of the victim and that his presence at the scene of the
crime was not indispensable to the commission of the same.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

is not worthy of any credence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> does not deny that he had a standing grudge against
the victim for calling him a thief in the presence of many persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He felt so disgraced that he and his wife
moved out of the house of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
must be because of such hatred that he persuaded <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span>
to join him in killing the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> assailed the discharge of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> as a state witness on the ground that such
discharge is improvident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> alleges that <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> was
more guilty than himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence
does not support the stance of appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Be that as it may, the discharge of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> as
state witness cannot be faulted as long as he is not the most guilty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The admission in evidence of the sworn statements of appellant <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> executed at the police station and during his
preliminary examination is also questioned by appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds it unnecessary to dwell on
the issue considering that the evidence on record is more than adequate to
generate appellant's conviction of the offense charged against him without
considering the said sworn statements.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the allegation of the appellant <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span>,
the commission of the offense with treachery and evident premeditation has been
established by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant nurtured a grudge and planned the killing of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He invited his two companions to help him
execute his plan to beat the victim to death with pieces of wood in the middle
of the night insuring the killing of the victim without risk to himself arising
from the defense which the offended party might make.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presence of treachery is clear.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was also established that previous to the incident, the victim
called appellant <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> a thief in the presence of
other people, and that appellant and his family transferred to another house
inasmuch as he could no longer bear the insults hurled at him by the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's resentment
culminated in the evening of April 14, 1984 when as above-related he persuaded
his two co-accused to join him in killing the victim, which they
accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sufficient time,
therefore, had elapsed from the time the appellant conceived the commission of
the crime until the execution thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, evident premeditation attended the commission of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, the assigned error as to the two aggravating
circumstances is not well taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it
may be true that nighttime is absorbed in the aggravating circumstance of
treachery, the aggravating circumstance of disregard of sex and age cannot be
similarly absorbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Treachery refers to
the manner of the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Disregard of sex and age pertains to the relationship of the victim, who
is a 70-year old woman, and the appellant who is young man, 27 years old, at
the time of the commission of the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court also takes note of the presence of the aggravating
circumstance of dwelling and that the crime was committed after an unlawful
entry.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mere lack of instruction or illiteracy of the appellant
cannot be considered as a mitigating circumstance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One does not have to be educated or
intelligent to be able to know that it is unlawful to take the life of another
person even if it is to redress a wrong committed against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conviction of appellant <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span> by
the trial court must be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now to the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapaz</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The main
thrust of his appeal is that the trial court failed to observe the degree of
care prescribed in imposing the death penalty upon a plea of guilty by an
accused charged with the commission of a capital offense, citing <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Padilla</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The appellant contends that the trial court failed to explain to him the nature
of the charge against him, especially the aggravating circumstances attending
the commission of the offense and that the trial court did not propound any
question to him regarding said circumstances so as to leave no room for doubt as
to the possibility of his misunderstanding the nature and gravity of the charge
to which he was pleading guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
argues that he was not advised as to the meaning and effect of the technical
language in the information in qualifying the acts constituting the offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also cites <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Formentera</u></span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court observed that the casual remark of the trial judge that the
penalty to be imposed is "<u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
to death" without specifically and categorically informing the accused of
the imposable penalty, and the averment of several aggravating circumstances in
the information, thus provide cogent reason to conclude that the accused did
not fully comprehend the consequences of his plea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He asserts that the trial court should have
called witnesses for the purpose of establishing his guilt and culpability not
only to satisfy the trial judge, but also to aid the Supreme Court in
determining whether the accused really and truly understood and comprehended
the meaning and the full consequences of his plea.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

</span>After her testimony, the trial court ruled that it was satisfied with
the testimony of the doctor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court also considered the evidence against appellant sufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings were to continue only insofar
as the two other accused were concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On August 17, 1984, the trial court rendered its decision finding
appellant <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapaz</span>
guilty of the crime of murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In disputing the argument of the appellant, the Solicitor General
states that the trial court did its duty of assuring that the appellant
understood his act, the nature of the charges filed against him and the
character of the punishment provided for by law before it is imposed,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the information was read to him translated into the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect which the appellant understood.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that appellant was informed by the trial court
that upon a plea of guilty he could be imposed the penalty of life imprisonment
to death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise true that the
trial court was informed that the appellant was illiterate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presiding judge verified anew if he
understood the charges against him and if his lawyer explained the consequences
of the plea to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused
confirmed his plea of guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the trial court required the presentation of evidence for
the prosecution but after the doctor testified as to the multiple injuries
inflicted on the deceased with the use of a blunt instrument, the trial court
considered the case against appellant submitted and rendered its decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the protestations of the appellant that the
trial court did not take pains in explaining to him the nature and character of
the offense charged against him, the consequences of the plea of guilty and the
meaning and effect of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances so as to
insure that the appellant fully understood the consequences of his plea of
guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, considering that in the same proceedings the trial
continued as against the two other accused, where one was discharged as a state
witness and the other remained for trial, and in the process the
accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> even testified as a witness
for his co-appellant Johnson <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span>, the Court is
not persuaded that the arraignment of said appellant on a plea of guilty was
improvidently undertaken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapaz</span> testified in court
and categorically admitted that he was the one who beat the victim to
death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He asserted that his two other
co-accused did not participate in the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted that he drank “<span class="SpellE">kulafu</span>” wine in
order to embolden himself to commit the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His admissions were made freely and
voluntarily even after he had been sentenced to death by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He related having committed the offense at
the dwelling of the offended party at night attended by treachery and qualified
by evident premeditation without regard to the sex and age of the offended
party. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The Court can take judicial
notice of this testimony of the appellant in court and of the other evidence
adduced during the trial in the resolution of his appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the trial court committed no
error in accepting the voluntary plea of guilty of appellant in this case and
in imposing the corresponding penalty thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant fully understood the consequences
of his plea.</p>

<p class="BODY">The guilt of both appellants Johnson <span class="SpellE">Barleso</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Cristoto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapaz</span> is
sufficiently established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
this Court affirms the judgment of conviction rendered by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, considering that the 1987
Constitution does not allow the imposition of the death penalty, the penalty
which should be and is hereby imposed on the appellants is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, and the indemnity that each of them should
