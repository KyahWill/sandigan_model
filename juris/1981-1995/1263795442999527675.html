<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioners, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Cresenciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Dionio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Dionio</span> pray this Court to 
reverse and set aside the Decision of the Intermediate Appellate Court 
dismissing for lack of merit their petition for review of a judgment of the 
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, </span>Branch III, 
rendered in Civil Case No. 3133.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said judgment had, in turn, 
affirmed a decision of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, ordering the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the petitioners from the building of the 
private respondent, Imelda C. Barrios, and sentencing said petitioners to pay 
Barrios the sum of P300.00 monthly beginning March <span>1977 </span>until they 
vacated the premises, P1,000.00 as attorney's fees, P80.00 which Barrios had 
paid to NAWASA, and the costs.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The record shows that respondent Barrios had leased to the 
petitioners her building located at XIX Martyr's Street in the </span><span class="SpellE"><em>poblacion</em></span> <span>of <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>, under a contract 
stipulating a term of </span>five (5) years from September 1969 at a monthly 
rental of P300.00;<span> that upon the expiration of the five-year period in 
September </span>1974, <span>the private respondent had verbally agreed to allow 
the petitioners to continue in occupancy on a month-to-month basis, terminable 
by the former upon giving the latter thirty days' written notice, at an 
increased rental of P500.00 monthly; that </span>at an unspecified time 
afterwards, the lease was modified to cover only a portion ("two doors") of the 
ground floor of the building at a reduced rental of P300.00 monthly; that in 
September <span>1976 </span>the private respondent formally advised the 
petitioners to vacate the premises within thirty days on the ground that the 
building would <span>be </span><span class="SpellE">remodelled</span>, but the 
latter refused to comply; and that written notice to vacate the premises within 
thirty days was <span>given by the private respondent's counsel in a letter 
dated March 4, 1977, received by the petitioners on March 8, 1977, which the 
latter also disregarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Thereafter, under date of </span><st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="5"><span>May </span>16, <span>1977</span></st1:date><span>, the 
private respondent filed with the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> a complaint seeking 
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the petitioners, to which the latter 
filed an answer dated </span><st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="5"><span>May 
</span>28, <span>1977</span></st1:date><span>, which was later amended on 
</span><st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="7"><span>July 7, 
1979</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The record before the Court does not 
disclose the reason for the two-year time gap between the original and the 
amended answers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The amended answer raised various defenses, among 
them:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) that the leased premises were residential in character, 
hence covered by the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 20, the rental being 
only P300.00 monthly; (b) that said Decree had been violated when the private 
respondent had raised the rental from P3</span>00.00 <span>to P500.00 monthly in 
October </span>1974; <span>and (c) that the demand to vacate was illegal 
because, the petitioners having paid rentals on a monthly basis following the 
expiration of the original lease in September </span>1974, <span>only the court 
could fix the period of the lease under Article </span>1687 <span>of the Civil 
Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>A counterclaim for damages, including alleged excess 
rentals, expenses for necessary repairs advanced by </span>the petitioners 
attorney's <span>fees and litigation expenses was also </span>set up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Upon the issues thus raised, the Municipal Court rendered 
judgment in the terms already adverted to, holding that the leased premises were 
commercial in character, hence not covered by Presidential Decree No. 20, and 
affirming the private respondent's right to terminate the lease by giving thirty 
days' written notice to vacate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On appeal, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span> affirmed, ruling that while the leased premises were 
to be deemed residential in character, Presidential Decree No. 20 could not, 
even in that event, apply to prevent the petitioners' <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> because the oral lease entered into by the parties 
following the expiration of their written contract in September </span>1974 
<span>was one with a definite period and was, therefore, excluded from the <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span> effect of Section </span><span>4 </span><span>of 
the Decree on expiration of the lease period as a ground for judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> provided in paragraph (1) of Article </span>1673, 
<span>Civil Code .<span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span><span>&nbsp; 
</span>The petitioners thereafter sought review by the Intermediate Appellate 
Court, with the result already stated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The grounds for judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> 
of a lessee under the Civil Code are set forth in Article </span>1673, 
<span>which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"ART. <span>1673.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> may judicially eject the lessee for any of the 
following causes:</blockquote>
<blockquote>(1)<span>&nbsp; </span>When the period agreed upon, or that which is 
fixed for the duration of the lease under articles <span>1682 </span>and 
<span>1687 </span>has expired;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>(2)<span>&nbsp; </span>Lack of payment of the price 
stipulated;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>(3)<span>&nbsp; </span>Violation of any of the conditions agreed upon in 
the contract;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote><span>(4)<span>&nbsp; </span></span>When the lessee devotes the thing 
leased to any use or service not stipulated which causes the deterioration 
thereof; or if he does not observe the requirements in No. 2 of article 1657, as 
regards the use thereof.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>The <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of tenants of agricultural 
lands is governed by special laws (1569a)"<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Section 4 Presidential Decree No. 20, issued on October 12, 
1972, suspended </span>"<span>*** until otherwise provided ***</span>"<span> 
paragraph (1) of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> Article 1673, insofar 
as concerns leases of dwelling units or land on which another's dwelling is 
located, except when the lease is for a definite period.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said 
Section reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>SEC. 4.<span>&nbsp; </span>Except when the lease is for a definite 
period, the provisions of paragraph (1) of Article 1673 of the Civil Code of the 
Philippines insofar as they refer to dwelling unit or land on which another's 
dwelling is located shall be suspended until otherwise provided; but other 
provisions of the Civil Code and the Rules of Court of the Philippines on lease 
contracts, insofar as they are not in conflict with the provisions of this Act, 
shall apply."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The suspension thus imposed (which was reenacted almost 
<em>verbatim</em> in Section </span>6 <span>of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, effected 
</span><st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="4"><span>April 10, 
1979</span></st1:date><span>) clearly operated on leases for which no definite 
period had been stipulated by the parties and as to which the law (Civil Code) 
steps in to prescribe periods as follows:</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"ART. 1687.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the period for the lease has not been 
fixed, it is understood to be from year to year, if the rent agreed upon is 
annual; from month to month, if it is monthly; from week to week, if the rent is 
to be paid weekly and from day to day, if the rent is to be paid daily.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>However, even though a monthly rent is paid, and no period for the lease 
has been set, the courts may fix a longer term for the lease after the lessee 
has occupied the premises for over one year.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the rent is 
weekly, the courts may likewise determine a longer period after the lessee has 
been in possession for over six months.<span>&nbsp; </span>In case of daily rent, the 
courts may also fix a longer period after the lessee has stayed in the place for 
over one month.<span>&nbsp; </span>(1581a)",</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span>as well as to leases which come 
into existence by "<span class="SpellE"><em>tacita</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>reconducdion</em></span>," or by implied renewal, as 
contemplated by Article 1670 of the Civil Code, reading:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>ART. 1670,<span>&nbsp; </span>If at the end of the contract the lessee 
should continue enjoying the thing leased for fifteen days with the acquiescence 
of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, and unless a notice to the contrary by 
either party has previously been given, it is understood that there is an 
implied new lease, not for the period of the original contract, but for the time 
established in articles 1682 and 1687.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other terms of the 
original contract shall be revived.<span>&nbsp; </span>(1566a)"</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Leases for a definite term were expressly excluded from the 
suspension, and could be the subject of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> 
proceedings against the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> upon the expiration of 
their term, unless thereafter impliedly renewed by the concurrence of the 
circumstances provided for in Article <span>1670.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It is also clear that the oral lease between private respondent 
and the petitioners which had its inception following the expiration of the 
five-year term of their written contract in September <span>1974 </span>was one 
with a fixed or definite period.<span>&nbsp; </span>Paragraph <span>4 </span>of the 
complaint in the original <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> action 
alleged:</p>
<blockquote><span>"4.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>That upon the expiration of the 
written lease agreement on September, 1974, plaintiff verbally agreed with 
defendants to extend the lease on a month to month basis subject to the 
condition that plaintiff shall have the absolute right to terminate the lease 
upon thirty (30) days written notice of termination sent to 
defendants;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Said allegation was admitted in paragraph <span>4 </span>of the 
Amended Answer, <span class="SpellE"><em>viz</em></span><span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span>"4.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>That the defendants admit the 
allegations contained in paragraph <span>4 </span>of the complaint that after 
the termination of the written contract of lease they were allowed to remain in 
the premises, provided they are to pay the increased rental from P300.00 
originally agreed in the written Contract of Lease to P500.00 per month, to 
which the defendant agreed with heavy hearts, defendants reminding plaintiff 
that said increase is against Presidential Decree No. 20, <em>and they have no 
other suitable place to transfer</em>, nevertheless, said plaintiff did not mind 
it;"<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span>True, said paragraph </span><span>4 
</span><span>of the amended answer, while admitting the agreement for extension 
of the lease, does not expressly admit that the extension was on a 
month-to-month basis and terminable on thirty days' notice.<span>&nbsp; </span>There 
is, however, no denial, either express or implied, of these alleged terms 
anywhere else in said pleading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">A lease stipulated to be on a month-to-month basis is one with a 
definite or specific period.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has been so held in <span class="SpellE"><em>Rantael</em></span><em> vs. Court of Appeals</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> where this Court ruled:</p>
<blockquote>"In the case at bar, the lease entered into between petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rantael</span> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Llave</span> 
commenced, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement on Occupancy of 
Apartment, on August 1, <span>1974, </span>the date of execution of the said 
Agreement, considering that the parties employed the phrase 'beginning today' 
with reference to the starting point of the period during which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rantael</span> would have use and occupancy of the premises of unit 
51-A.<span>&nbsp; </span>As to the duration and termination of the aforementioned 
contractual relations, the parties used the phrase "on a month to month basis" 
in the Agreement with reference to the length of time during which petitioner 
<span class="SpellE">Rantael</span> would have use and occupancy of the leased 
premises.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Month here should be construed, in like manner as in 
the interpretation of laws pursuant to the provisions of Article 12 of the Civil 
Code of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
there being no reason to deviate <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, as a 
period composed of thirty days.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractual relations between 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rantael</span> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Llave</span> ceased after the expiration of the first thirty days 
reckoned from August 1, <span>1974 </span>but continued for the next thirty-day 
period and expired after the last day thereof, repeating the same cycle for the 
succeeding thirty-day periods, until the said respondent <span class="SpellE">Llave</span> exercised her prerogative under the agreement to 
terminate the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, by express exception of P.D. No. 20, judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> lies 'when the lease is for a <em>definite</em> 
period' or when the fixed or definite period agreed upon has expired.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The lease in the case at bar having a definite period, it indubitably 
follows that the exception, rather than the general rule, applies and, 
therefore, respondent <span class="SpellE">Llave's</span> right to judicially 
eject petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rantael</span> from the premises may be duly 
enforced.<span>&nbsp; </span>***."</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">Later cases like <em>Cruz 
vs.Puno</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and <span class="SpellE"><em>Lesaca</em></span><em> vs. Cuevas</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <em>reaffirm</em> the view that a lease on 
a month-to-month basis is one with a fixed term which terminates at the end of 
each month.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners, however, having seemingly abandoned an earlier 
contrary posture and conceded that <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> would lie 
under Presidential Decree No. 20, now anchor their case on the sole proposition 
that Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> No. 25, which superseded 
Presidential Decree No. 20, in its Section 5(f) limits <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> on the ground of expiration of period only to 
<span style="font-style: italic;">written</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> 
</span>leases, and that it was error to decree their <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, the lease invoked by private respondent being 
admittedly an oral one.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">What this contention either overlooks or would conveniently ignore 
is the fact that the private respondent's cause of action to evict petitioners — 
which arose when the thirty-day period fixed in her notice to vacate expired 
without petitioners' quitting the premises — accrued, and the complaint on the 
basis thereof was filed, while Presidential Decree No. 20 was in effect, and 
Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 still 
lay two years in the future.</p>
<p class="BODY">In exempting from suspension <span class="SpellE">ejectments</span> 
on the ground of expiration of the lease period, Section <span>4 </span>of 
Presidential Decree No. 20 made no distinction between oral and written lease 
contracts and no distinction may, therefore, be inferred.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Consequently, at the time of filing her action, the private respondent 
had a clear and indubitable right to eject the petitioners, the period of the 
latter's lease expiring at the end of every monthly period, as held in the cases 
already cited, and the stipulated notice to quit having been given, and ignored 
until it lapsed and even afterwards, as already stated.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such right 
is not affected, much less abrogated, by the mere <span class="SpellE">supervention</span>, before the action can be heard and decided, of 
a law limiting permissible <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> on the ground of 
expiration of period to written contracts of lease.<span>&nbsp; </span>This, even 
supposing that Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 can in no way be construed except in that sense, a 
question into which it is not necessary to inquire at this time.</p>
<p class="BODY">An analogous situation was presented in <em>Cruz vs. Puno, Jr., 
supra</em>, which involved a month-to-month lease terminable by either party by 
means of written notice served upon the other at least thirty days prior to the 
date of termination.<span>&nbsp; </span>After affirming the rule that a 
month-to-month lease is one with a fixed period, hence excluded from the 
suspension imposed in Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 20, this Court went 
on to hold that:<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"At all events, the fact remains that the parties agreed, under the 
stipulation of the lease contract as quoted above, that either one of them may, 
on a thirty-day notice, terminate the lease.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>This agreement 
is, at the time it was entered into, a perfectly valid undertaking</em>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Not being against the law, public policy or custom, it is the law between 
the parties, as all valid contracts are, and the obligations thereof may not be 
impaired by <span>law, as ordained by the 
constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>It seems all too clear that to hold, under the authority of 
Presidential Decree No. 20, that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> may not 
anymore exercise the right under the agreement and subject the lessee to the 
corresponding obligation, or the other way around, as the right to terminate the 
lease may be exercised also by the lessee, would be to lend to the decree a 
legal infirmity arising from the provision of the Constitution that no law 
impairing the obligation of contract shall be passed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The decree, 
with all its manifest social justice intent, could not have meant to ignore any 
constitutional injunction.<span>&nbsp; </span>It means only to regulate, or perhaps 
even restrict, the exercise of proprietary right for a higher<span> purpose than 
just protecting private interest, which is that of advancing general welfare by 
giving direly needed benefits to the poor and the underprivileged under 
conditions of economic crisis, but not at the cost of the sanctity of contracts, 
the obligations arising from which being shielded by the constitution from 
impairment.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>The decree, therefore, in order that it would not be tainted with 
constitutional repugnancy, must be construed as only restricting the freedom of 
the parties to contract, but only in a prospective <span>manner. 
***."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">It is also worth noting that the rent control law now in force, 
Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 
<span>877,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> has erased the distinction 
invoked by the petitioners between oral and written leases insofar as expiration 
of the lease period as a ground for judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> 
in leases covered by said law is concerned.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>Whereas, Batas 
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 provided 
that <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> shall </span>be <span>allowed on the 
ground (among others) of "(E)<span class="SpellE">xpiration</span> of the period 
of a written lease contract,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> the 
corresponding provision in Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 877 reads simply, "(E)<span class="SpellE">xpiration</span> of the period of the lease contract."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </span></span></p>

the express and implicit conclusions reached herein.<span>&nbsp; </span>It merely 
affirmed the obvious proposition that the suspension imposed in Section </span>4 
<span>of Presidential Decree No. 20, as well as in Section </span>6 <span>of 
Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25,
