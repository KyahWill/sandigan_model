married to Dorothea <span class="SpellE">Albovia</span>, 32 years of age, and a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> resident of <span class="SpellE">Nagcarlan</span>,
Laguna, was filed with the then Court of First Instance of Laguna and docketed

A. <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span>, as presiding Judge of the Court, issued

</span>60-82), but the same was denied in a resolution promulgated on <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1987</st1:date> (Ibid., p. 83).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners raised three (3) issues, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>1. WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFUNCT COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF LAGUNA HAD
ACQUIRED JURIS­DICTION OVER THE QUESTIONED ADOPTION CASE, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT
THE SOLICITOR GENERAL WAS NOT NOTIFIED OR REPRESENTED IN SUCH ADOPTION.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. WHETHER OR NOT THE CHALLENGED ADOPT­ION PROCEEDINGS AND ORDER OF
ADOPTION ARE VITIATED WITH NULLITY FOR LACK OF STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH STATUTORY
REQUIREMENTS AS PRESCRIBED BY LAWS GOVERNING ADOPTION; AND<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. WHETHER OR NOT THE QUESTIONED PROCEEDINGS AND ORDER OF ADOPTION
SHOULD BE NULLIFIED BY REASON OF EXTRINSIC FRAUD. <o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>first
issue, it is petitioners' contention that the Solicitor General, not having
been notified so as to make the State a party thereto, the then Court of First
Instance of Laguna did not acquire jurisdiction over the questioned adoption
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To support this contention, they
claimed that there is no dispute that the State has an interest in the
adoption, particularly in securing the observance of our laws concerning the
qualifications and disqualifications of both the adopted and adopter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">designed </span>to conserve the best interests
of society and the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition,
quoting the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> vs. Republic (102 Phil.
1046), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">they alleged </span>that in the
said case, it is explicit that the State <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">must
be </span>made a party to an action involving changes in the civil status,
nationality <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">or </span>citizenship of a
person; and from the standpoint of the effects of adoption, the same involve
changes in the personal and civil status of an adopted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly ruled by respondent Court of
Appeals, no existing law or rule has been pointed out requiring notice to the
Solicitor General as a condition precedent or as a jurisdictional pre-requisite
for the valid exercise of the court's jurisdiction in an adoption case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, petitioners can not point any law or
rule since a perusal of the provisions of the Civil Code on adoption (Chapter
5, Articles 334-348) and the provisions of the Rules of Court (Rule 99) fail to
show such requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to the ruling
in the <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span> case, quoted by petitioners to support
their contention, a mere reading of the same will readily show that it is not
applicable in the instant case, since it involves the correction of entries in
the civil registry.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second issue, petitioners claim that the statutory
requirements, in three instances, were not strict­ly carried <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">out </span>in the questioned adoption
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is their contention that
pursuant to Republic Act No. 644, the questioned adoption case should have been
filed with the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Nagcarlan</span>, Laguna,
where the supposed adopter, Nieves <span class="SpellE">Suiza</span>, was then
residing; that Section 5 of Rule 99, which requires the presentation of sat<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">is</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">factory
proof in open court, was not strictly followed since (1) the reception of proof
of compliance with the jurisdictional requirement was delegated to the Deputy
Clerk of Court and not done by the presiding judge himself, </span>and (2) the
Deputy Clerk of Court likewise received the evidence for the supposed adoption
in support of the allega­tions of the petition for adoption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the stenogra­phic <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">notes </span>attached to the records of the
case were not transcribed and that the stenographer concerned took said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">notes outside the premises of the court on
January 24, 1983, or eleven (11) years after the date of issuance of the
questioned order of adoption, for the purpose of transcribing the same; and
that there was the non-compliance with the statutory commands regarding the
registration and/or recording of the order </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">adoption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">These contentions</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
petitioners are without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Republic
Act No. 644 gave to the justices of the peace</span> and judges of municipal
courts concurrent jurisdiction on adoption cases with the then Courts of First
Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, adoption cases
could be filed in any of the said courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, Republic Act No. 644 can not and did not in any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">way </span>affect the herein questioned petition
for adoption which was filed with the then Court of First Instance of Laguna,
which unquestionably had territorial jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">Nagcarlan</span>,
Laguna, and had jurisdiction over the nature of the petition (Sec. 1, Rule 99,
Rules of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to the alleged
delegation to the Deputy Clerk of Court, suffice it to say that this Court, in
the case of <span class="SpellE">Laluan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Malpaya</span>
(65 SCRA 495, 499-500 /<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">1</span>975/; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cited in the case of National Housing
Authority vs. Court of Appeals, 121 SCRA 777 /1983/, ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"No provision of law or principle of public policy prohibits a
court from author­izing its clerk of court to receive the evidence of a party
litigant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, the reception of
evidence by the clerk of court constitutes but a ministerial task - the taking
down of the testimony of the witnesses and the marking of the pieces of
documentary evidence, if any, adduced by the party present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This task of receiving evidence precludes, on
the part of the clerk of court, the exercise of judicial discretion usually
called for when the other party who is present<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> objects to questions propounded and to the admission of the
documentary evidence prof­fered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More
importantly, the duty to render judgment on the merits of the case still </span>rests
with the judge who is obliged to personally and directly prepare the decision
based upon the evidence reported."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">As to the allegation that the
stenographic notes were not transcribed, etc., the reason given by respondent
Court of Appeals in this regard can not be faulted -</p>

<blockquote>"The Certification issued on March <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">8, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1983 by Deputy Clerk
of Court <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Magcalas</span>

taken by him on October 28, 1971 in connection with Special Proceed­ings Case
No. SC-377 which is attached to the record of said case (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
E), does not necessarily prove that there is no trans<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">cript of stenographic notes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That stenographic notes of the proceeding were taken is firmly borne out
by the records of the case and the aforementioned certification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That no transcript was attached to the
records is not proof that there is no such transcript.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After spending so much for publication, there
is no reason for the notes not to be transcribed which will cost only a few
pesos given the brevity of the proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact it appears from the REPORT TO COURT that the commissioner
submitted to the Court ‘the transcript of the stenographic notes taken by
stenographer Mr. <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> Mendoza during the reception
of the </span>evidence on <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="10">October 28,
 1971</st1:date> for its consider<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ation.’
(Records, p. 14).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the trans­cript
is prepared subsequent to the proceedings to be transcribed, this must have
been handed to the Presiding Judge separately from the records of the case and,
for this reason, it was not attached by the Clerk to the records of the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any experienced trial judge is
familiar with this practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure
to subsequently attach the trans­cript to the records due to oversight is not
altogether unlikely, and is not sufficient to vitiate what otherwise is a valid
proceed­ings.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span>to be
presumed that Judge <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span>
received and read the transcript of stenographic notes before he issued the
challenged order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, in fact, no
pretense that the findings of Judge <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span> in his
order are not in accordance with the evidence which must have been culled by
him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">from the transcript of stenographic
notes."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">As to the allegation of non-registration,
this has no factual basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be

A </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A-30) and the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Adulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Baviera</span> are sufficient to
prove that said patient was not physically able </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">attend the hearing
and testify before the Court of First Instance in Sta. Cruz, Laguna on October
28, 1971; and that respondent Court of Appeals failed to consider the fact that
private respondent admitted all their proffered documentary exhibits (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. A to A-30).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be stated that even granting that
private respondent admitted petitioners' proffered documentary evidence, the
Court of Appeals, nevertheless, has the discretionary power to look into
related matters of record having some bearing on specific issues raised before
it, stressing the paramount aim of promoting the ends of justice (<span class="SpellE">Miraflor</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 142 SCRA 18 /1986/; citing
the cases of Hernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span>, 78 Phil. 196, and <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 2 SCRA 873).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having such power, it considered as
infirmities on petitioners' evidence, the defense raised by private respondent
that petitioners' documentary evidence, Exhibits "A" to
"A-30", were false and falsified because the said medical records are
those of one Ursula <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> and not of Nieves <span class="SpellE">Suiza</span>; that Exhibit "A-3" is cited as an example
which shows that the name of Ursula <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was erased, and superimposed on it is the
name of Nieves <span class="SpellE">Suiza</span>; and that it is pointed out that
Case No. 246552 as appearing in Nieves <span class="SpellE">Suiza's</span>
admission card, when traced in the admission log books of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Institute, will give the patient's name as one
Ursula <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 1 and
1-A), while another admission card with patient Case No. 246552 is also in the
name of Ursula <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With said infirmities, and as aptly
stated by the Court of Appeals, petitioners' claim imputes the commission of a
criminal offense of falsification committed in the course of judicial
proceedings, and as such, requires a strong, clear, and convincing if not
indubitable evidence; petitioners' adduced evidence could not be said as
strong, clear and convincing to warrant the annulment of what strongly appears
to be a valid and regular proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
