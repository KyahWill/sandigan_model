</i>questioning certain resolutions of the National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC), to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) a restraining order
dated April 30, 1987, staying the execution of the labor arbiter's decision in
NLRC-NCR Case No. 6-2423-86 pending resolution of the petition for relief from
judgment; 2) resolution dated November 5, 1987, granting the motion of herein
petitioners to compel the posting of bond thus ordering ACD Computer Services
and Ma. Rosario <span class="SpellE">Cabel</span> to post a bond in the amount of
P107,085.17; and 3) resolution dated January 28, 1988, reducing the bond
required to be posted to P5,000.00 upon a motion for reconsideration filed by
ACD Computer Services and <span class="SpellE">Cabel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts led to the filing of the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1986</st1:date>,
herein petitioners filed before the NLRC a complaint against ACD Computer
Services and Ma. <span class="GramE">Rosario A. <span class="SpellE">Cabel</span>
for illegal dismissal and non-payment of certain benefits.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No.
6-2423-86.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1987</st1:date>,
the labor arbiter rendered a decision sustaining the petitionersâ€™
position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the respondents are hereby
ordered to pay complainants the total sum of P111,097.32 as itemized in the
body of this Decision and P11,109.70, or 10% of the total amount as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">attorney's fees.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1987</st1:date>,
the labor arbiter, upon motion of the petitioners, issued a writ of execution
to enforce said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, the sheriff served a notice of garnishment to
the Commercial Bank of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> after
which the total amount of P15<span class="GramE">,031.85</span> was
garnished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This amount has already been
turned over to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1987</st1:date>,
a levy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>execution was made upon
the properties found in the respondents' office premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">ACD Group Inc., an American firm based in California, U.S.A.,
through its Chairman, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span> filed a
third-party claim in the NLRC case on the ground that it is the real owner of
the computers levied upon and scheduled for auction on April 10, 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This third-party claim was denied in an order
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 1, 1987</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
ACD Computer Services and Ma.</span> Rosario A. Cabal filed before the NLRC a
petition for relief from judgment in NLRC - NCR Case No. 6-2423-86 with prayer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for </span>the issuance of a writ of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">preliminary </span>injunction and/or
restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This petition was
docketed as Injunction Case No. 1402.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC then issued the questioned resolutions incidental to
Injunction Case No. 1402.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="12">December 9, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">, </span>the petitioners filed before the NLRC a motion to dismiss
and/or answer to the petition on the ground that a petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>relief is not a remedy granted
under the Labor Code and NLRC Rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without waiting for the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
resolution on their motion to dismiss, the petitioners filed the present
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition seeks to annul the three NLRC resolutions, to
prohibit the NLRC from taking further proceedings in Injunction Case No. 1402
and to direct the NLRC to dismiss said injunction case and to order the full
execution of the decision in NLRC - NCR Case No. 6-2423-86.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Luis A. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, counsel for ACD
Computer Services and Ma. Rosario A. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cabel</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> was served copies of all resolutions of the Court in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1988</st1:date>, he filed a manifestation stating he was no
longer their counsel but without any indication as to the name of <span class="GramE">new counsel nor</span> the advice he gave to his clients.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the only issue is the
validity of the questioned resolutions of the NLRC and that the various aspects
pro and con of the petition have been fully discussed by the petitioners' counsel
on one side and the Solicitor General on the other, the Court resolved to
decide this petition without any further delay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The various pleadings and annexes give a full picture of what was before
the public respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is involved
here is an unreasonable delay in the execution of a final and partially
executed judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommends that the petition be dismissed
for being premature, applying the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative
remedies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further stressed the
jurisdiction of the NLRC and its exercise of sound discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, we gave due course to this petition on a finding, among
others, that the instant case falls under the exc<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt">e</span>ptions to the general rule on exhaustion of administrative
remedies.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">held </span>in the
case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Rocamora</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>RTC-<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></u> <u>(Branch VIII)</u>, (G.R. No. 65037, <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="11"><span class="GramE">November</span> 23, 1988</st1:date>):</p>

<blockquote>But the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not an
inflexible rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it yields <span class="GramE">to</span> many accepted exceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As we have noted in a number of cases, exhaustion is not necessary where
<u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> there is <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
on the part of the party invoking the doctrine; where the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">challeng</span>ed<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> </span>adm<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">inistrative act is
patently illegal, amounting to lack of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt">ju</span>ris<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">d</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">iction; where there is unreasonable delay or
official action that will irretrievably prejudice the complainant; where the
amount involved is relatively small so as to make the rule impractical and
oppressive; where the question involved is purely legal and will ultimately
have to be decided anyway by the courts of justice.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At least two of these exceptions are present in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">There had been no action on the challenge to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">p</span>etition for relief from judgment for
almost <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a
year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>This is considerably long
considering that the labor arbiter's decision had already become final and in
fact has been partially executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
main case had been filed as early as <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="6">June
 20, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this case involving the propriety of a remedy and the
suspension of an execution would only be further delayed if we remand it to the
NLRC, only to have any decision raised again before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that all the relevant facts are before this Court, we
resolve to discuss and settle the dispute with finality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Tejones</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Gironella</span>, G.R. No. 35506, March 21, 1988; <span class="SpellE">Quillian</span> v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 55457, January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">20, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">ACD Computer Services and <span class="SpellE">Cabel</span> filed a
petition for relief from judgment on the ground that they were denied due <span class="GramE">process, particularly that they were not given "a more
definite statement of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the specif</span>i<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">cations of </span>the offenses allegedly
committed by them"</span> and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>the
complainants' position paper was not furnished to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">They
also raise </span>the long discredited argument that appeal was not timely made
as the filing clerk of the respondentsâ€™ counsel misplaced the labor arbiter's
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">A <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">careful e</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">x</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">amination

Filipino Pipe Workers Union (NLU) v. <span class="SpellE">Batario</span>, G.R.
No. 75851, July 29, 1988).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the records clearly show that ACD Computer
Services and Ms. <span class="SpellE">Cabel</span> have never been denied
"their day in court".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
they have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">cleverly used unmeritorious </span>procedural
technicalities to delay the e<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">x</span>ecution
of a valid judgment.</p>

heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Planters

20, 1989).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">ACD Computer Services and <span class="SpellE">Cabel</span> were
given ample <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">opportunity </span>to
present their side of the labor dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They received an order from the labor arbiter requiring them to submit a
position paper on or before the scheduled hearing on <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They asked for the resetting of the hearing to <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1986</st1:date> and extension of time within
which to submit their position paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This extension was granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1986</st1:date>,
they once more moved for a postponement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was again granted but they were given only up to <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1986</st1:date> within which to
submit their position paper.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="10">October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">9, </span>1986</st1:date>, the respondents'
counsel failed to appear in the hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, no position paper was submitted by them at any time on or
before the said date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was then
deemed submitted for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the records to show that they requested for
"a more definite statement of the specifications of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>offenses allegedly committed by
them".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only pleadings they
filed were motions for postponements and extensions of time to file a position
paper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the granting of these
motions, they neither attended the hearing nor submitted a position paper.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only time they acted upon the case was when the decision had
already become final and partially executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held in the case of <u>Filipino</u> <u>Pipe</u> <u>Workers</u>

<p class="BODY">We see no need to discuss the applicability before the National
Labor Relations Commission of the Rules of Court on a petition for relief from

committed the reversible error of tolerating an unreasonable delay in the
