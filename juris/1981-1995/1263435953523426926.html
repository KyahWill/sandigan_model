justification, despite due demand and request made by defendant Mariano Lim,
the copy of said Order of July 11, 1984 being served on plaintiffs' counsel
only on February 22, 1985, for the purpose of giving undue advantage in favor
of the plaintiffs and discrimination against defendants in said case by
delaying the finality of the order of dismissal and allowing the plaintiffs to
prolong their stay on the land in litigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">CONTRARY TO LAW." (p.
8, rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Paraphrasing the Sandiganbayan,
the chronological recitation of events, based in part on the stipulation of
facts and the rest on the evidence adduced during the trial, may be stated, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u> - The Regional Trial Court of Rizal (Br. 71) issued
an Order, dated 11 July 1984, denying plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration of
the order of 23 January 1984, that dismissed the complaint in Civil Case No.
290-A, entitled "Pinagkamaligan Indo-Agro-Development Corporation, et al.
v. Mariano Lim et al.";</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u> - On 31 August 1984, the complaining witness
Mariano Lim, one of the defendants in the above civil case, learned of the
rendition of the Order and the fact that it had not yet then been served upon
the plaintiffs.  Lim felt "agitated
about the loss of eleven days before the decision's period of finality had
commenced to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">run," and he,
therefore, made representations with the Executive Judge, the Hon. Antonio
Benedicto, to have the Order served on Atty. Patrocinio Palanog, the counsel
for the plaintiffs;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u> - The accused, a process server, was directed to
effect the service.  His first attempt
was unsuccessful because he could not locate the address of Atty. Palanog.  The accused again tried on 02 September
1984, and although this time he found the address, Atty. Palanog and his entire
family had apparently gone out for the weekend.  The accused found only a woman, not a member of the family of
Atty. Palanog, who had only been asked to watch over the house.  Accused Coronado did not thus leave the
Order;</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fourth</u> - On 22 February 1985, Lim went back to the
courthouse where he was informed that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">case
had meanwhile been sent to the archives together with 29 other cases (Exhibit
"E") (Ibid.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Fifth</u> - On 25 February <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">1985, </span>Lim returned to the courthouse and, examining the records,
he observed additional unnumbered pages that include, among other things, a) a
return, dated 4 September 1984 (Exhibit "F"), signed by accused
Coronado stating that plaintiff's counsel, Atty. Palanog, could not be
contacted; b) an entry at the foot of the Order of 11 July 1984 (Exhibit
"A-2") to the effect that Atty. Palanog had received the Order on 25
February 1985; and (c) a return, dated 25 February 1985 (Exhibit "B")
that the Order had indeed been served on plaintiffs (pp. 35-36, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing, particularly the 5-month delay in
the service of the court order, the Sandiganbayan convicted herein petitioner
of having violated Section 3(f) of Republic Act No. 3019 and imposed upon him
the indeterminate penalty of imprisonment for six (6) years and one (1) month
to nine (9) years and one (1) day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue in this case is whether or not the failure of
the petitioner to successfully serve the 11 July 1984 Order, given the above
settings, warrants his conviction under Section 3(f) of the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provision of the law (Republic Act No. 3019)
alleged to have been violated provides:</p>

<blockquote>Section 3. Corrupt Practices of Public
Officers:  The following shall
constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared
unlawful:</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>(f) Neglecting or
refusing, after due demand or without sufficient justification, to act within a
reasonable time on any matter pending before him for the purpose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of obtaining, directly or indirectly from any
person interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage
in favor of or discriminating against another interested party.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Admittedly, the elements
of the offense are that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">a) The offender is a public officer;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">b) The said officer has neglected or has refused to act without
sufficient justification after due demand or request has been made on him;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">c) Reasonable time has elapsed from such demand or request without
the public officer having acted on the matter pending before him; and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">d) Such failure to so act
is "for the purpose of obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person
interested in the matter some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in
favor of an interested party, </span>or discriminating <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">against another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The attendance of the
first three elements in this case can hardly be disputed.  The controversy, however, lies on the fourth
element.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We agree with the
Sandiganbayan that, indeed, there was failure on the part of the petitioner, a
public officer, to observe due diligence in his assigned task; let us call it
one of neglect, a broad term which is defined as the failure to do what can be done
and what is required to be done (West's Legal Thesaurus/Dictionary, 1986).  In its generic sense, it would not matter
whether such refusal is intended or </span>unintended.  But here that is not the real issue.  To warrant conviction for a violation of
Section 3 (f) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, the law itself
additionally requires that the accused's dereliction, besides being without
justification, <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>purpose</u> <u>of</u>
(a) obtaining, directly or indirectly, from any person interested in the matter
some pecuniary or material benefit or advantage in favor of an interested party
or (b) discriminating against another interested party.  The severity of the penalty imposed by the
law leaves no doubt that the legislative intent is to consider this element to
be indispensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record is bereft of evidence, <u>albeit</u> alleged, to
indicate that the petitioner's failure to act was motivated by any gain or
benefit for himself <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>knowingly
for the purpose of favoring an interested party or discriminating against
another.  It is not enough that an
advantage in favor of one party, as against another, would result from such
neglect or refusal.  Had it been so, the
law would have perhaps instead said, "<u>or</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>consequence</u>
of such neglect or refusal undue advantage is derived by an interested party or
another is unduly discriminated against."</p>

<p class="BODY">Let it again be said:  It
has always been the avowed policy of the law that before an accused is
convicted of a crime, his guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and the
burden of that proof rests upon the prosecution.  The stringency with which We have scrupulously observed this rule
needs no further explanation; suffice it to say that it behooves us to do no
less whenever at stake is the life or liberty of a person.  And so it is, not only in the appreciation
of the evidence but likewise in the application and interpretation of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not that We are condoning the misconduct of the petitioner,
nor that we are unmindful of the prejudice that may have been sustained by the
private respondent, but the legal remedies lie elsewhere, not in the instant
action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">, </span>the judgment appealed from is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">REVERSED </span>and the petitioner, Juan
Coronado, is hereby acquitted of the charge on reasonable doubt.</p>
