<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the trial court and adopted by respondent

<blockquote>"From the evidence extant on the record, the following facts
appear undisputed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That accused <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> <span class="SpellE">Tieck</span> <span class="SpellE">Heng</span>,

for which he was given a pass book in his name of Tomas P. Flores (see <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made a
second deposit of P400.00 then a withdrawal of P500.00 then a deposit of
P775.00, and then a withdrawal of P1,000.00 (Entries on <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<blockquote>"On 13 March (sic, August) accused went to SBTC and filled up
or accomplished and signed a deposit slip (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B)
for a deposit of P18,060.00 in check.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the deposit slip, he submitted to Urbana Ramos de <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, Teller No. 2 of SBTC, his pass book (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C) and a Philippine Bank of Communications Check No.

next day, </span><st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="8"><span style="">17 August 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, the accused withdrew another amount of
P5,500.00 upon defendant's submission to Teller No. 3 of a withdrawal slip (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F) and the pass book. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The withdrawal was posted in the pass book as
shown by Exhibit C-3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of
the sum withdrawn, the teller caused the accused to sign at the back of the
withdrawal slip and which signature is marked Exhibit F-1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., pp. 21-30;

I) to Candida <span class="SpellE">Abella</span> Villanueva, Teller No. 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deposit of P18,060.00 was thus posted at

<blockquote>"Sometime in that month of August 1973, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dycaico</span>, who maintains the Checking Account No. 13360
with the Philippine Bank of Communications saw his Statement of Account and
came upon an amount of P18,060.00 debited against his account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He complained to the PBC that he never issued
a check for that much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this information
PBC informed SBTC that the check, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, was a
spurious check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, SBTC officials
instructed their bank tellers to watch for Tomas P. Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NBI agent <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Espartero</span> was also assigned to crack down on check forgers
or passers in company with an informer, at the premises of SBTC, in

</span>The accused appeared in the SBTC premises on <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="8">22 August 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He filled up, accomplished and signed a withdrawal slip (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K) for P15,500.00, and after that he submitted his passbook
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C) with the withdrawal slip to Maria Victoria <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, SBTC Teller No. 7.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Forewarned to watch for the accused Tomas P. Flores, she asked the
accused to sign his name in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K, and he did sign
it as requested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He signed his name of <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> <span class="SpellE">Tieck</span> <span class="SpellE">Heng</span>
(See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K-3).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After that, Teller No. 7 brought the slip and the pass book of Tomas P.
Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Teller No. 7 returned to her
cage and then called up for Tomas P. Flores.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused went to Teller No. 7.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Appellant pleaded not guilty when arraigned in both cases, which
were subsequently ordered consolidated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In his defense at the trial, and later adopted for the same purpose in
his brief, appellant claims:</p>

<blockquote>"That on <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="8">August 9,
 1973</st1:date>, he went to the Supersonic Auto Supply, situated at the corner
of <span class="SpellE">España</span> and P. <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span>
Sts., <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went there to buy auto spare parts as he
is engaged in the buying and selling of auto spare parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was at this store, a person whom
accused claimed to know later as Jimmy Go, was also buying tires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The store did not have tires for sale, and so
the tire salesman pointed to the accused as one who is selling such stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, this man went to the accused and asked
him if he had tires for sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused
asked the man who introduced himself to the accused as Jimmy Go, how many tires
he needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This man told the accused he
needed twenty-four (24) pieces of tires.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused told this 'Jimmy Go' that he had the 24 tires but that he needed
cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused told 'Jimmy Go' that he
does not accept checks for payment, especially he did not know him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused claims that that was the first time
he had met this man 'Jimmy Go'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Jimmy
'Go', however, told the accused that he can issue the check and he can deliver
the tires only after having <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this proposition, the accused agreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Jimmy Go', therefore, brought out a check,
now <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, and then signed it in his presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He signed the name 'F. <span class="SpellE">Dycaico</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then crossed the check at the upper left
hand corner of the check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused claims
that except the signature and the lines used to cross the check as
aforementioned all the other handwritten portions of the check were already
there when ‘Jimmy Go' signed it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After signing <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, ‘Jimmy Go'
handed it to the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing the
amount to be big, as the cost price of the 24 pieces of tires was only about
P3,000.00, more or less, the accused told ‘Jimmy Go' that he has no cash to
return for the difference. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>'Jimmy Go'
told him to just deliver the difference after he has <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the accused got the check and
they parted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He claimed he went to the SBTC on <st1:date year="1973" day="13" month="8">13 August 1973</st1:date> as he deposited the check (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A) in his bank account (passbook, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
C), filling up <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> a deposit slip (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused claimed that on <st1:date year="1973" day="13" month="8">13 August 1973</st1:date>,
he went to withdraw P10,000.00, accomplishing <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

accused went to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">España</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>
and delivered to ‘Jimmy Go' the P10,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He delivered the tires in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On that same day, ‘Jimmy Go' told the accused that he needed the balance
of the money and so he said that he delivered the balance of P5,500.00 on 16
August 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this date, <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="8">16 Aug. 1973</st1:date>, as per his claim,
'Jimmy Go' again delivered to him another check (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
H) as ‘Jimmy Go' was buying another fifty (50) pieces of tires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, he took the check and deposited it with
SBTC on his account (passbook, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims he could not get the proceeds of
the checks because at the time he was withdrawing from his deposit, two men

<p class="BODY">Culled from the submissions of both parties in the present appeal
and the established facts of these cases, the issues raised and submitted for
determination by us may be synthesized into whether or not respondent court
erred -</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) In supposedly changing the tenor and/or nature of the
accusation and convicting appellant on the basis of this new accusation without
having informed him of the nature and cause of the accusation;</p>

<p class="BODY">(2) In holding that there is a crime of attempted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and convicting appellant of such crime in the
absence of the essential elements of deceit and damage; and</p>

<p class="BODY">(3) In arriving at a conclusion of guilt of the crimes of
attempted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>,
both thru falsification of commercial documents, on the basis merely of a
presumption of law, despite the absence of evidence showing that appellant
committed, or had knowledge of, the crimes charged, in violation of the
constitutional presumption of innocence and doctrinal jurisprudence on proof
beyond reasonable doubt in favor of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
was formerly denied in a Resolution of this Court, dated August 18, 1978,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
but was later on given due course on a Motion for Reconsideration and/or for
New Trial,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
based <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, on an alleged letter
of one Jimmy Go dated August 14, 1978, which appellant supposedly received on
August 21, 1978 and which he claims he could not have discovered and produced
during the trial of the cases despite diligent efforts to produce the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere <span class="SpellE">zerox</span>
copies of the supposed letter and the mailing envelope were appended to said
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not, however, deem it proper to include the aforesaid
matter in the issues above enumerated considering that the requirement in the
1964 Rules of Court<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>,
which was then in force, to the effect that a motion for new trial must be
supported by affidavits of the witnesses by whom such evidence is expected to
be given, has not been complied with; and (b) the judgment of conviction will
not in any way be affected by such evidence the authenticity and credibility
whereof have not been established, aside from the obvious fact that the tenor
thereof is inherently improbable and such a letter could easily be concocted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the first issue, appellant alleges that there is a
variance between the allegations in the information and the evidence adduced,
thereby depriving him of the right to be informed of the nature and cause of
the accusation against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule that an accused cannot be convicted of an offense not
charged or included in the information is based upon the right to be informed
of the true nature and cause of the accusation against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
However, respondent court exhaustively discussed this issue and lucidly explained
the facts upon which its judgment of conviction was predicated, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"It is a fact that under the two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>,
the mode of falsification attributed to the Accused is that of having erased
and altered the dates and amounts of the checks in question, and superimposing
or causing to be superimposed over the original dates and amount of said checks
other dates and amounts, thereby making alterations and changes in genuine
documents which changed their meaning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, therefore, the offense charged is that penalized under Article
172 in relation to Article 171 (6) of the Revised Penal Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is to be noted, however, that presented in evidence by the
prosecution for the First Case were two checks, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
'A' and 'O', which both bear the identical Check No. U-186378 but the former
bears the amount of P225.00, while the latter that of P18,060.00, both drawn
and issued by 'F. <span class="SpellE">Dycaico</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the Second Case, two checks were likewise
presented, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'H' and ‘P' which bear the identical
Check No. U-186414, but the former bears the amount of P2,030.00, while the
latter that of P18,060.00, both drawn and issued by 'F. <span class="SpellE">Dycaico</span>'.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"Prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dycaico</span>, admitted that
he issued the checks, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'O' and 'P', in the
amounts of P225.00 and P2,030.00, respectively, but denied having issued at all
the checks, Exhibits 'A' and 'H', both in the respective amounts of P18,060.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has to be conceded, therefore, as alleged by the defense, and
as likewise admitted by the People, that considering the evidence adduced,
there were no erasures nor alterations nor superimpositions as alleged in both <span class="SpellE">Informations</span>, but that Exhibits 'A' and 'H' were forgeries <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, while the Accused has been charged of <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> and Attempted <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> thru
Falsification of a commercial document under Article 172 in relation to Article
171, paragraph 6 of the Revised Penal Code, reading -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Art. 171.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall falsify a document by
committing any of the following acts:</p>

<p class="2Q">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>

<p class="2Q">‘6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Making any alterations
or intercalation in a genuine document which changes its meaning,'<o:p></o:p></p>

<blockquote>based on the evidence, the accusation
would fall under either paragraph 1 or 2 of Article 171 of the same Code which
reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counterfeiting or
imitating any handwriting, signature or rubric;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q">'2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Causing it to appear
that persons have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in
fact so participate.'<o:p></o:p></p>

<blockquote>"Be that as it may, as pointed out by the State, the
aforementioned variance affects solely the charge of Falsification, of which
the Accused should not have been convicted under the time?honored rule
that an Accused should be informed of the true nature and cause of the
accusation against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, with
respect to the charges of <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> and Attempted <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>, respectively, (<span class="SpellE">complexed</span>
under the two <span class="SpellE">Informations</span> with Falsification of a
Commercial Document) conviction would still be proper, the two essential
requisites of <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>, namely fraud or deceit and
damage to another, having been charged and proven."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the second issue, appellant contends that respondent court
erred in convicting him of attempted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in
Criminal Case No. 15007 when it admitted in its decision that appellant was not
able to withdraw the value of the second check as he was apprehended in the act
of withdrawing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this, he
argues that having failed to withdraw the sum as part value of the second
check, no amount whatsoever was taken by him, hence no damage or prejudice was
suffered by the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent such
damage, he concludes, he can not be convicted of attempted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is specious argumentation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Basically, the two essential requisites of fraud or deceit and
damage or injury must be established by sufficient and competent evidence in
order that the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> may be established.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Deceit is the false representation of a matter of fact (whether by words or
conduct, by false or misleading allegations, or by concealment of that which
should have been disclosed) which deceives or is intended to deceive another so
that he shall act upon it to his legal injury.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that appellant was the possessor and <span class="SpellE">utterer</span>
of the checks in question (Exhibits "A" and "H") and having
benefited from the subsequent withdrawals, as well as having attempted to gain
by trying to withdraw an amount thereon:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the inevitable conclusion would be that he was the one who falsified
said Exhibits "A" and "H." Ineluctably, the use of the
spurious checks is by itself fraud or deceit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although one of the essential elements of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
is damage or prejudice to the offended party,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
in the absence of proof thereof the offender would at least be guilty of
attempted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant commenced the commission of the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
but he failed to perform all the acts of execution which would produce the
crime, not by reason of his own spontaneous desistance but because of his
apprehension by the authorities before he could obtain the amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since only the intent to cause damage and not
the damage itself has been shown, respondent court correctly convicted
appellant of attempted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, appellant insists that there is no evidence whatsoever
pointing to him as the person who falsified the two checks in question (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "A" and "H"), as the prosecution
failed to refute his version regarding the circumstances under which he
allegedly took possession of the said checks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He further posits the view that while the courts may apply the
presumptions of law in some cases, the presumption that the possessor of a
falsified document is presumed to be the forger does not constitute proof
beyond reasonable doubt and can not be applied in his case, allegedly because
the provisions not only of the Constitution but also of the Rules of Court must
be the basis of the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it may appear that the prosecution failed to directly
contradict the claim of appellant as to how he came into possession of the two
checks, it is understandable that the prosecution would not always have the
means for obtaining such direct evidence to confute acts contrived
clandestinely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, too, as a
general rule, positive testimony as to a particular fact, <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
by anyone, should control the decision of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, however, there is such an inherent
improbability in the testimony or theory of the witness, the court may properly
disregard such evidence, even in the absence of any direct conflicting
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with respondent
court that the People's version of the facts deserves more credence and it is
more in consonance with human experience.</p>

<p class="BODY">As repeatedly expounded by this Court, evidence to be worthy of
credit, must not only proceed from a credible source but must, in addition, be
credible in itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And by this is meant
that it shall be natural, reasonable and probable as to make it easy to
believe.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
No better test has yet been found to determine the value of the testimony of a
witness than its conformity to the knowledge and common experience of mankind.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
As bewailed by the court below, the theory espoused by appellant "is
taxing too much the credulity of this Court, an insult to the humble
intelligence and the common sense of this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The checks in question (Exhibits "A" and "H")
were undeniably spurious, or were forgeries <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dycaico</span> categorically testified that he did not issue
said checks but only those checks in the amounts of P225.00 and P2,030.00
(Exhibits "O" and "P").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The disclaimer by <span class="SpellE">Dycaico</span> of his alleged
signatures on the aforesaid checks is <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence of
falsification and consequently shifts the burden of evidence to appellant to
prove otherwise, but which burden appellant has not discharged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, as well as respondent court, posed
the question as to the identity of the forger, and we are satisfied that both
courts did not err in relying upon the presumption that the possessor of a
falsified document is presumed to be the author thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an established rule that when it is
proved that a person has in his possession a falsified document and makes use
of the same, the presumption or inference is justified that such person is the
forger.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioner has been shown to have been the possessor and <span class="SpellE">utterer</span> of the two checks (Exhibits "A" and
"H") when he made use of and benefited <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
by his withdrawals of and attempt to withdraw funds through said checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstance, therefore, that appellant
made use of and benefited from the falsified document is a strong evidence that
he either himself falsified it or caused the same to be falsified,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
he being criminally responsible in either case.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Since appellant is the only person who stood to be benefited by the
falsification of the document that was found in his possession, it is presumed
that he is the material author of such falsification.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus apparent that the refusal of respondent Court of
Appeals to give credence to the theory of the defense is substantially
supported by the ambient circumstances and the evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, this being a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
of a decision of respondent court rendered in the exercise of its exclusive
appellate jurisdiction over the decision of the trial court, said decision of
respondent court is "final," subject only to our power of review on
questions of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>
