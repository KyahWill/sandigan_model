<p class="BODY">In support of his first and second assigned errors, the appellant
capitalizes on the turnabout in the testimony of prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Cenon</span> Herrera.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Five <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(5) hours after the killing, Herrera gave a
detailed statement of the incident identifying the assailants, specifying their
acts, and narrating in clear and logical sequence exactly what took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Forty six (46) days later, he executed an
affidavit before the municipal mayor, exculpating the appellant from direct </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">participation </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stated that at the time of the incident,
he merely saw Salvador Samson nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This subsequent statement cannot be given any
probative value not only because it was made 46 days after the incident but because
it was repudiated and the first statement reaffirmed when Herrera was placed on
the witness stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit H, the sworn
statement of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Herrera, was
admittedly given "freely and voluntarily." </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Being the companion of Lara at the time of
the incident, he could easily distinguish between the persons who hacked the
victim beside him and the persons who were merely within the vicinity of the
crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his first statement which was
spontaneously given, he was positive that Samson was among those who stabbed and
hacked Lara.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is believable
considering that he was the companion of the victim and the place was
lighted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He even stated that he was not
in a state of shock when he made the statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In contrast, the manner by which he made his recantation was doubtful,
thus, prompting the trial court to note that he was lying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, when asked by the Fiscal whether he
was the one who personally executed the affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1), he admitted that the same was prepared by the counsel for the defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the court cannot give any weight to the retraction of
the earlier statement by the witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same principle which looks with disfavor upon retractions of
testimonies previously given in court may also be applied here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An eyewitness may be prevailed upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to either recant the first statement or tell
a different story once placed on the witness stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that retractions can easily be
secured from </span>poor and ignorant witnesses usually for a monetary
consideration (<span class="SpellE">Reano</span>, et al. v. CA, et al., G.R. No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">80992, September 21, 1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or they may be threatened with harm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the eyewitness told the truth
once questioned during the trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense likewise questions the reaction of one of the
prosecution witnesses who happens to be the sister of the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense contends that the reaction of <span class="SpellE">Bumangkit</span> was not natural for a sister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that she should have run to her
brother's succor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
unnatural about the sister's reaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was alone and helpless so that her natural action, as would be done
by any other person in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the same
situation, was to run and shout for help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In contrast, it was the reaction of Samson which was unnatural.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="GramE">version of the facts
reveal</span> that when he saw that somebody was stabbed, he ran home and
slept.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the normal course of events,
his reaction is unusual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he
has not successfully explained the fact that he was still wearing the same <span class="SpellE">maong</span> pants and t-shirt which he wore during the stabbing
and which pair of pants was stained with blood and full of mud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">His </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">explanation that the
blood stains were<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>caused by his
falling into a ditch is quite flimsy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The difference in the number of assailants as specified by
prosecution witnesses Herrera and <span class="SpellE">Bumangkit</span> is of no
consequence considering <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>under
such circumstances, it is not expected <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">that witnesses </span>would have a clear account of
the details of the incident, such as the number of attackers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Human instinct would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">dictate self-preservation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What
is important is the fact that both positively identified Samson.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the records which would
show a motive or reason on the part of these witnesses to falsely implicate the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In </span><u>People</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">v.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it was held that if no motive was shown
why the prosecution witness would falsely incriminate the appellants,
identification would be given full credit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further contends that his motive to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">kill </span>has not been established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contention is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof of motive is not necessary when there
is positive identification of the assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant assigns as the trial court's third error,
the qualifying of the crime to murder by treachery and evident premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the defense that evident premeditation was not
clearly established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, we cannot
concede that treachery is likewise absent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court committed an error in assuming that these circumstances
are inseparable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly stated by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the Solicitor General, evident premeditation
and treachery are independent of each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there was treachery in the sudden,
deliberate, and unexpected attack on the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was sitting down when he was attacked and
was stabbed simultaneously by the assailants, thus insuring the accomplishment
of the crime without risk to the appellant and his group arising from the
defense which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the victim might have
offered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u>
</span><u>Rojas</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">147 SCRA 169
[1987] clearly enunciates the principle, thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"treachery exists when the offender commits any crime against
persons, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which tend
directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising
from any defense which the offended party might make."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, evident premeditation cannot be appreciated as
there was no direct evidence of the planning and the preparation to kill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We quote with<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
