76, both of Block 573 of the Cadastral Survey of Manila which were developed
into the <span class="SpellE">Agno-Leveriza</span> Tenant Association (ALTA)
Subdivision by the City of Manila pursuant to Republic Act No. 4145, was

problem in the area to the extent that non-resident awardees have to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">eject <span class="SpellE">bonafide</span>
residents in order to acquire physical possession of their awarded lots, and an
extensive displacement of structures of resident families has to be undertaken
to allow each <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> resident family to have

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Nor can petitioners claim

have fully paid their obligations to the City of Manila under their respective
contracts before the issuance of the decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, in accordance with our decision in Export Processing Zone
Authority vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span>,

unconstitutional, those lot owners who have not yet received compensation under
the decree are entitled to a judicial determination of the just compensation for
their lots.</p>
