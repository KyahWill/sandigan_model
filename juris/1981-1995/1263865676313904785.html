at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span>, Jr. was shot to death
at the Travel Lodge Restaurant in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> by a person who managed to
escape in the ensuing confusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two
months later, Jesus Acosta was identified as the killer by three witnesses and
charged with murder before the regional trial court of that city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Convicted after trial in a decision penned by
Judge Manuel A. Patron,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the accused-appellant is now on appeal before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">His appeal is based mainly on the insufficiency of the evidence
of the prosecution identifying him as the person who shot <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also reiterates his defense of alibi which
he claims was improperly rejected by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal witness of the prosecution was Freddie <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span>, a waiter of the said restaurant, who declared that
<span style="">he served the accused-appellant shortly
before the </span>killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified
that Acosta arrived at the restaurant at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon and asked for a beer, which he immediately
brought him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acosta was <span style="">carrying a paper </span>bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <span style="">that
time there was no other customer in the place, but when Acosta asked for a
second bottle of beer, there were already around ten other </span>customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These left after a while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="40" hour="18">6:40
 p.m.</st1:time> <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city>
arrived with Mayor Ramon Vera Cruz of <span class="SpellE">Unisan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, and his secretary, Jose <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
and they sat at a table about five meters from the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this time Acosta had already ordered <span style="">his </span>third bottle of beer, also served
by <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
brown-out then occurred and on <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span> order (he was the manager of the restaurant), <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span> lit <span style="">a </span>kerosene
lamp and placed a lighted candle on each table.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was at this juncture that Acosta asked for his bill, paid for the
beers, and left.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span> said that shortly thereafter,
Acosta came back to the restaurant, entering through the back door, and ordered
another bottle of beer from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span> went to the counter to get it but minutes later,
when his back <span style="">was turned, he heard a
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never saw Acosta again that
night.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

his part, Jose <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> said it was Acosta who
approached their table during the brown-out when </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villavicencio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> was shot from behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although he did not actually see the
shooting, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> declared he saw the
accused-appellant lower the gun he was carrying and step backwards to flee
through the back door.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two other witnesses for
the prosecution testified on the possible motive for the killing.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> They suggested that it might have been a
dispute over a cockpit bet and rivalry in the <span class="SpellE"><u>jueteng</u></span>
business and that Acosta had acted </span><span style="">as
a </span><span style="">hired gunman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For his part, Acosta
declared that he was at the time of the killing nowhere near the restaurant,
being then </span>in <span class="SpellE">Atimonan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
<span class="GramE">an</span> hour's ride away by public transportation.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
He was supported by his friend, M/Sgt. Gabriel de Guzman, who testified that he
met the accused-appellant in <span class="SpellE">Atimonan</span> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> in the <span style="">afternoon of </span><st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="4"><span style="">April 28, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, and the two of them had attended a court
hearing in <span class="SpellE">Macalelon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
<span class="GramE">the</span> following day.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The identification of the
offender is crucial in every criminal prosecution where the defense pleads
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless the identity of the
culprit is established beyond reasonable doubt, the charge against the accused
must be dismissed on the ground that the constitutional presumption of
innocence has not been overcome.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its brief, the defense
contends that the identification of the accused-appellant as </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villavicencio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="">'s</span></span><span style=""> killer had not been sufficiently proved,
being based merely on unlawful suggestions made by the investigating </span>authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These suggestions unduly influenced the
witnesses into pointing to the accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The only lead the
investigators had of the killer was that he was about five feet tall and lean,
as described by <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceeding on this information, they asked
the three prosecution witnesses to take a look at Jesus Acosta, who was then being
detained in </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Camp</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nakar</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, and see if he was the person who had shot </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Villavicencio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the time he was identified by <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ayado</span>, Acosta was alone in his detention cell.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There was no one else beside him with whom
he might be compared by the two onlookers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The argument of the defense is that as there was no police </span>line-up,
Acosta's identification was a manipulated conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, there was admittedly a police line-up when he
was asked to identify the accused-appellant, but this reaction was practically
suggested if not actually induced by the investigators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Earlier he had been shown a picture of Acosta
which had not been mixed with other pictures so as to give him a choice.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> At the police line-up, Acosta was wearing
the same shirt he wore in the picture.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, he was the shortest person in the
line-up, which should have been confined to persons of the same height and
build as he, to prevent improper suggestiveness.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> All this was deliberately designed to insure
Acosta's identification </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the killer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is clear that the
manner in which all three witnesses were asked to identify the
accused-appellant was less than objective.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It impaired the trustworthiness of their identification insofar as it
was elicited only by that questionable procedure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> v. Wade,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the U.S. Supreme Court observed through
Justice Brennan:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>What facts have been disclosed in specific cases about the conduct
of pre-trial confrontations for identification <span class="GramE">illustrate</span>
both the potential for substantial prejudice to the accused at that stage and
the need for its <span style="">revelation at
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A commentator provides some
striking examples:</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">In a Canadian case ... the defendant had been picked out of a
line-up of <span style="">six </span>men, of which he
was the only Oriental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other cases, a
black-haired suspect was placed among a group of light-haired persons, tall
suspects have been made to stand with short <span class="GramE">non-suspects,</span>
and, in a case where the perpetrator of the crime was known to be a youth, a
suspect under twenty was placed in a line-up with five other persons, all of
whom were forty or over.</p>

<blockquote>Similarly state reports, in the course of describing prior
identifications admitted as evidence of guilt, reveal numerous instances of
suggestive procedures, for example, that all in the lineup but the suspect were
known to the identifying witness, that the other participants in a lineup were
grossly dissimilar in appearance to the suspect, that only the suspect was
required to wear distinctive clothing which the culprit allegedly wore, that the
witness is told by the police that they have caught the culprit after which the
defendant is brought before the witness alone or is viewed in jail, that the
suspect is pointed out before or during a lineup, and that the participants in
the lineup are asked to try on an article of clothing which fits only the
suspect.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of People v.
Cruz,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> a robbery with homicide was committed by a
band of persons wearing masks (which allegedly fell off the face of the
accused) in </span>a <span style="">house that was
either completely dark or adequately lighted, depending on the conflicting
versions of the two witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
witnesses were later made to identify the accused-appellant in the following
manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That very same afternoon, Angeles Cruz was picked up in front of a <span class="SpellE">moviehouse</span> and brought to the police station for
questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was made to walk and
turn around in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Emma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruz was not placed in a police lineup,
contrary to standard stationhouse verification procedure, to test the accuracy
of the witnesses' memory, and to afford a mere suspect a fair chance of early
relief from the inconvenience inflicted on one <span style="">who is mistakenly identified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Emma testified that the
several accused, including Cruz, were pointed out to them </span>as <span style="">the persons suspected by the police as the
perpetrators of the robbery committed in </span><span class="SpellE">Goso</span>-on,
and as notorious "tough guys" in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The identification at the police station was
attended, as the two girls <span style="">themselves
admitted, by a great deal of whispered conversations as well </span>as <span style="">by at least one unexplained conference
elsewhere </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the municipal building, at which they were
present, immediately prior to their being confronted with the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In rejecting the
identification made by the two witnesses, Justice Fred Ruiz Castro said for the
Court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The manner by which Emma and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> were
made to identify the accused at the police station was pointedly suggestive,
generated confidence where there was none, activated visual imagination, and,
all told, subverted their reliability as eyewitnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This unusual, coarse and highly singular
method of identification, which revolts against the <span style="">accepted principles of scientific crime detection, alienates the esteem
of every just man, and commands neither our respect nor acceptance.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Apart from the above
considerations, we agree that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
suffers from the added defect that by his own admission he saw Acosta only for </span><span style="">a few </span><span style="">seconds and in fact did not pay much attention to him before the
shooting.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is no less significant that after the
shooting, not only was it dark because of the brown-out but there was already a
great deal of alarm and confusion that could easily have beclouded his
remembrance of the incident and its principal <span class="SpellE">progatonists</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for <span class="SpellE">Ayado</span>, it is
not really believable that she could have followed <span class="SpellE">Osmillo's</span>
every movement during the period covered by his own testimony, as she would
also have been attending to her own duties at that time as bookkeeper of the
restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court discerns in her
declaration </span>a <span style="">palpable effort to
corroborate every detail of <span class="SpellE">Osmillo's</span> testimony that
renders her own testimony suspect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span> is another matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not think it is flawed by the irregular manner in which he
and <span class="SpellE">Ayado</span> were made to identify Acosta at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Nakar</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE">,</span> as such identification was not really necessary in his
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree that in the case of <span class="SpellE">Ayado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, there was
improper suggestiveness exerted on them to induce them to believe that Acosta
was the same person they had seen two months earlier when <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city> was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our view, however, that suggestiveness did
not induce or impair <span class="SpellE">Osmillo's</span> own identification,
which was made on a different basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Osmillo's</span> identification was not based
on his own observation of Acosta in his detention cell at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nakar</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
but on his previous experience with the accused-appellant on the day of the
killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incident at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nakar</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
only seconded his earlier identification of Acosta on <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1980</st1:date>, before <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city> was shot in the neck
by the lone gunman.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span> testified that Acosta arrived
at the restaurant at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon and left at about twenty to seven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the waiter who served Acosta three
bottles of beer during that period of more than one-and-a-half hours and it was
he who met Acosta again when, after paying his bill and leaving through the
main door, he re-entered through the back door of the restaurant and ordered
another bottle of beer from <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not see Acosta for only <span style="">a </span>few seconds, as <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
did, or from <span style="">a </span>distance, like <span class="SpellE">Ayado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They talked
to each other for at least five times, the first three when Acosta placed his
successive orders of beer, the fourth when he asked for his chit and paid <span class="GramE">it,</span> and the fifth when he returned and ordered another
beer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During that period, he saw Acosta
long enough to retain recollection of him after the incident even without the
necessity of his going to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nakar</span></st1:placename></st1:place> to take a look at the
accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">That identification at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nakar</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
merely <u>affirmed</u> his earlier impressions of Acosta that he had acquired
during the time he served him at the Travel Lodge Restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, when <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span>
went to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nakar</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, he was not identifying
Acosta for the first time at the prodding of the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span> merely <u>recognized</u>
Acosta then.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of this conclusion, we find that there is sufficient
evidence to establish the identity of the accused-appellant <span style="">as </span>the person who killed <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The identification made by <span class="SpellE">Ayado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> must be, as
it is hereby, rejected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even so, the
testimony alone of <span class="SpellE">Osmillo</span>, who had a long enough
time to retain his <span style="">recollections </span>of
that tragic afternoon, including the physical description of Acosta, who was
his customer, justifies the accused-appellant's conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi is less than persuasive and must also be
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of de Guzman is
hardly believable and does not deserve much comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the distance between <span class="SpellE">Atimonan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City is against the accused-appellant, who
could easily have come from <span class="SpellE">Atimonan</span>, assuming he was
really there on that date, committed the crime in <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>
City, and thereafter gone back to join his friend in <span class="SpellE">Atimonan</span>
that same night or the following morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, we have held in a long line of decisions that alibi is
unavailing against the positive identification of the culprit,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
which has <span class="GramE">been</span> clearly and unmistakably established in
the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing was qualified by <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>,
the murderer having shot the victim from behind without warning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evident premeditation not having been proved
and there being no mitigating circumstances, the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> was correctly imposed, together with the
civil indemnity of P30,000.00 payable to the victim's heirs, and the costs of
the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the challenged judgment is AFFIRMED and the
