dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused
Rodolfo Bragaes and Nestor Numeron guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as
co-principals, of the offense of murder, and each is sentenced to serve the
penalty of Reclusion Perpetua; to severally indemnify the heirs of the late
Gabriel Fetalino in the amount of Twelve Thousand Pesos (P12,000.00),
Philippine Currency, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and
each to pay one-third of the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused Gemina Faner-Festin is also found guilty beyond
reasonable doubt, as accomplice, of the same offense, and she is sentenced to
suffer imprisonment of Six (6) Years and One (1) Day of Prision Mayor, as
minimum, to Twelve (12) Years and One (1) Day of Reclu­sion Temporal, as
maximum; to severally indemnify the heirs of the same deceased in the same

the municipality of Calatrava, province of Romblon, <span style="">Bragaes </span>alias Dupong, Numeron alias Mindanao Boy and Gemina
Festin all conspired to kill Gabriel Fetalino and <span style="">at </span>5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of February 24, 1980, with
treachery and evident premeditation, they assaulted him with a knife locally
known <span style="">as a </span>"balisong"
thereby inflicting on him <span style="">a </span>mortal

his </span>common<span style="">-law</span> wife
Gemina in <span style="">Calatrava.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to prosecution
eyewitness Cecilia Servañez, a teacher, at around 5:00 o'clock </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the afternoon of February 24, 1980, while she was </span>on <span style="">her way home, she observed a group of people
gathered near the </span>gate of the Calatrava High <span style="">School.  She was informed that
Gabriel </span>Fetalino<span style=""> had</span> <span style="">been boxed by Numeron and that the two were
pacified by Ludovico Famorcan and Enoc Fajutag.  Upon learning that </span>Gemina and Numeron <span style="">had </span><span style="">gone home, she followed </span><span style="">them
</span><span style="">as she used to be </span>the
teacher of Gemina.  When she was near <span style="">their </span><span style="">house, </span>she heard Gemina shouting, "Yawa sida asi ging <span style="">parogo</span>-an<span style=""> ro akot</span> <span style="">anak,
yawa!"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When </span>she <span style="">saw that Numeron </span><span style="">was </span>about <span style="">to go back to Fetalino, Cecilia </span>said, <span style="">"Tama na, </span>Nestor, <span style="">nalaman

Ambi.” Numeron replied, “Ah, hindi naman ako natatakot kahit isa lang ako </span><span style="">may mga alalay din </span><span style="">ako." </span><span style="">Since </span><span style="">Gemina was still
shouting, Cecilia tried to reason with her and asked, "Bakit pinaiinit mo </span>ang
<span style="">asawa mo?” Gemina replied, "Asi
gani ging parogo-an ang ako it </span>anak <span style="">maado pang magkamatay kita tanan." (Why did they cause blood [to

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As Cecilia was trying to </span><span style="">pacify Gemina </span><span style="">and Numeron, she saw Bragaes went </span>up <span style="">the stairs.  Gemina, Numeron and
Bragaes then had a conversation for around ten minutes.  Afterwards, Bragaes went down </span>the <span style="">house, proceeded to the intersection of the
street and faced the north so that he could see Numeron who was sitting on the
window sill of their house.  Just then,
Cecilia saw Fetalino walking towards the direction of </span><span style="">Bragaes.  </span><span style="">Upon seeing Fetalino,
Numeron jumped from the window, pulled a knife, opened it and walked towards
the direction of </span><span style="">Fetalino.  </span><span style="">Numeron
held the knife with his right hand </span><span style="">and
signalled Bragaes by </span><span style="">crossing
his left hand over his neck.  </span><span style="">Bragaes acknowledged </span><span style="">the signal by nodding </span>his head.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon seeing the signal, Cecilia shouted, "Rayagan Tang Ambe,
rayagan!" (Run, Tang Ambe, run!) Fetalino looked towards Numeron and when
he <span style="">saw </span>that Numeron had a knife,
Fetalino turned clock­wise making himself abreast with Bragaes.  Fetalino proceeded towards the gate of the
Calatrava High School and there, Bragaes thrust his right hand towards the back
of Fetalino.  Then, "with a normal
face," Bragaes returned to the house of Gemina.  Gemina was then at the foot of the stairs of the house.  As Bragaes went up the stairs, he handed
"something long" to Gemina while saying, "Ito na ang ibinigay mo
sa akin kanina, itago mo." To Numeron, who was the last to go upstairs,
Bragaes said, "Bay, tana, sinaksak ko dahil sa sinyas mo, patay ‘yon wag
ka nang bumaba.” Upon hearing this, Cecilia ran to where Fetalino was.  She found him unconscious and bleeding from
the stab wound.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Fidel Falqueza, who was then in the house of his daughter,
corroborated Cecilia's testimony.  Falqueza saw that Gemina and Fetalino had an argument because the latter
slapped Gemina's son after he allegedly did something which Fetalino asked him
not to do.  Numeron was then sitting by
the gate of the school and when he saw that Gemina and Fetalino were arguing,
he approached them and hit Fetalino twice with his fist.  The protagonists were separated by Ludovico
Famorcan and Enoc Fajutag.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After Gemina and Numeron had gone home, Falqueza saw Cecilia
Servañez went to the house of the couple.  Cecilia pacified Numeron telling him that he had done enough as he had
punched Fetalino.  Gemina then asked why
blood was let out of her son.  At that
moment, Falqueza saw Bragaes passing by on his way to Gemina's house where
Bragaes stayed with Gemina and Numeron for about five minutes.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Later, Bragaes <span style="">we</span>nt
to the middle of the road which was about twelve meters from <span style="">Gemina's </span>house.  As Fetalino was walking to the church,
Numeron, while holding a knife, jumped out of the window.  Cecilia shouted at Fetalino, exhorting him
to run.  Numeron then made a sign by
passing his pointed finger across his throat.  Bragaes saw the sign and nodded.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fetalino ran to the gate of the high school but Bragaes overtook
him, pushed Fetalino with his left hand and, with his right hand, stabbed him
when they were a mere half meter from each other.  Taken aback, <span style="">Fetalino </span>turned
to Bragaes and said, "Why did you stab me when you are not involved in
this quarrel?" Falqueza saw that Bragaes used a yellowish knife which he
later inserted in his waist pocket.  Then Bragaes walked towards the house of Gemina.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Bragaes and Numeron were apprehended immediately after the
commission of the crime by the mayor and the police.  Gemina, who was then pregnant with Numeron's child, was not
detained although <span style="">she accompanied the
two to the municipal hall.  Numeron and
Bragaes did not confess to the commission of the murder</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> but they executed a joint waiver of their
right to be released after the maximum period of detention for their "own
safety."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> When asked as to the whereabouts of the
death weapon, Numeron allegedly said that it was in the </span>possession of
Gemina.  <span style="">The knife was retrieved from the top of the aparador in Gemina's house.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Fetalino, </span><span style="">59 </span><span style="">years old, postmaster and community leader, was brought to the Romblon
Provincial Hospital where he expired at around 12:30 in the early hour of
February 25, 1980.   His death
certificate shows that he died of massive hemorrhage resulting from a stab
wound at the right s</span><span style="">ide </span><span style="">of his back.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Patrolman Allan Famini intercepted an envelope containing two letters addressed
to Violeta Montesa.  Both letters were

everything at the trial as he was not afraid to die while telling the truth and
even falsehoods about Numeron </span>("x x x <span style="">at lahat lahat ng kanyang gawain ipagtatapat ko rin at malalaman </span><span style="">mo </span><span style="">rin pagdating </span><span style="">ng </span><span style="">aming bista hindi ako natatakot mamatay na

<p class="BODY">For the defense, Gemina admitted that she had an altercation with
Fetalino because when she asked him why he slapped her son Michael, Fetalino
replied that he could afford to pay for Michael's treatment.  Having seen them quarrelling, Numeron boxed
Fetalino but they were pacified by several persons.  Gemina denied having seen Cecilia Servañez in the vicinity or
that Cecilia followed her and Numeron to their house.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching home, Numeron sat on the bench by the window while
Gemina went to the kitchen to prepare supper.  Then she heard Mayor Fortu and some policemen calling for Dupong
(Bragaes).  She went to the sala and
inquired from the mayor why they were looking for Dupong.  The mayor replied that they were arresting
Dupong for killing Tang Ambi.  The
police arrested not only Dupong but also Numeron.  Gemina followed them when they were taken to the municipal jail.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the investigation,
the police looked for the knife.  Gemina
told the investigating officer that the knife ("balisong") was on top
of the aparador in her house.  Patrolman
</span>Sixon <span style="">then got the knife and
brought it back to the municipal building.  Gemina, however, denied having given the knife to Bragaes nor that the
latter had handed it to him.  She had never
seen it much more taken possession of it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to Gemina,
Bragaes was not really a partner of Numeron in operating the
"pula-puti" game because Bragaes was working for a certain </span><span style="">Aling </span><span style="">Rita.  However, the two were </span>“good
to one another” <span style="">and treated each other
as brothers.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Gemina admitted that Numeron jumped out of

admitted that her testimony that Numeron jumped </span>out <span style="">of the window was the tenor of her

who killed Fetalino because <span style="">during </span>the
incident, she was inside her house.  She
denied having ordered Numeron to kill Fetalino.  In fact, she even asked Bragaes why he stabbed Fetalino when what
happened between her <span style="">and </span>Fetalino
was "a very small thing." Bragaes allegedly could not answer her.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Numeron admitted having boxed Fetalino because the latter, after
saying that he could afford to pay Numeron, struck him with a broom.  He corroborated Gemina's testimony that her
son Michael was slapped by Fetalino but added that Fetalino suspected that the
boy had spilled the palay of Fetalino.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Like Gemina, Numeron denied having seen prosecution witness
Cecilia Servañez in the area.  According
to him, upon reaching home, he requested Gemina to prepare food.  When Gemina went to the kitchen, he sat on
the bench near the window.  Then he
heard someone <span style="">call </span>him and as he
stood and placed his hand on the window shutter, he was stoned by Federico
Mirabete.  His upper arm was hit.  So, carrying a knife, he jumped out of the
window to demand an explanation from Mirabete.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> Upon
reaching the ground, he picked <span style="">up </span>a
stone but Mirabete stoned him once again and ran to his own home.  Numeron then went up the house and closed
the windows.  He did not leave the house
until the mayor and the police arrived.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before Numeron closed the door of the house, Bragaes, who came
from the cockpit, entered.  Bragaes went
to the room and sat on the bed.  Then
Numeron heard the mayor asking Gemina where Dupong was.  Gemina replied that Dupong was in
Tan-agan.  The mayor then asked for
Numeron.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">According to Numeron, after he and Fetalino had exchanged <span style="">blows, </span>he ran to the concrete wall to
prevent being attacked from the back.  When Gemina approached him, he held her by her shoulders and used her as
a shield <span style="">as </span>several persons were
attacking him.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
After he had gone up the house, he heard people shouting that Tata Ambi was
wounded ("Tang Ambi nabuno") from the vicinity of the high
school.  He heard the commotion after
Bragaes had arrived in their house.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Numeron asserted that Bragaes pleaded guilty during the
preliminary investigation because policeman Falogme had threatened him with a
gun and even civilians were able to maltreat him.  He, however, did not advise Bragaes to execute an affidavit <span style="">on </span>his alleged maltreatment.  Asked whether the reason why Bragaes owned
the <span style="">killing was his </span>promise to
him that should Bragaes plead guilty thereby exculpating him and Gemina, Bragaes
would get P5,000, Numeron swore that he never made that promise.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Bragaes admitted that he stayed with Numeron and
Gemina for half a month.  During the
time that he stayed with them he was employed by Numeron on commission basis in
the latter's gambling operation.  In the
afternoon of February 24, 1980, he was in the cockpit.  On his way to the house of Gemina, he saw
several p<span style="">eople </span>on the<span style=""> </span>street.  Suddenly, the people scampered away.  He felt somebody bump him from behind.  He made a side-step and came face to face with Numeron.  He asked Numeron what happened but instead
of answering him, Numeron dragged him towards Gemina's house and told him to go
up.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Gemina was <span style="">in </span>the
house wiping blood from the chin of her child.  Numeron then locked the windows of the house while he <span style="">went </span>inside the room and sat on the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his appeal, Bragaes
assails the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and asserts that the lower

<span style="">Numeron and Bragaes in the killing of
Fetalino.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Bragaes asserts that the
testimonies of the three prosecu­tion witnesses so differ that "it cannot
be determined with moral certainty” if indeed he stabbed Fetalino citing
specifically the testimony of Cecilia Servañez that it was Numeron whom
Fetalino faced first.  Bragaes insists
that said testimony collides with the respective testimonies of Falqueza and
rebuttal prosecution </span>witness Fontevillar Arriola that Fetalino <span style="">was </span>being chased by <span style="">Bragaes when he was hit and that Fetalino was
stabbed "as he was </span>just passing by."<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Whatever inconsistencies
are apparent from said testimonies, they are minor ones that do not
consequently discredit the </span>witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a> It
should be <span style="">noted </span>that the
witnesses were not so <span style="">situated in the
same spot that </span><span style="">they </span><span style="">would have a single point of view.  On the contrary, their testimonies prove
that indeed they were present during the incident and, inspite of the
confusion, excitement and horror of what they were witnessing, they were able
to reveal in court what they saw albeit from different </span>angles.<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>is <span style="">immaterial that witnesses Cecilia Servañez
and Allan Famini are related to Fetalino because their testimonies, inde­pendent
of the relationship, are not inherently improbable in themselves.  Neither is there proof that they were
charged with </span>improper motives to incriminate the appellants.<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, with <span style="">respect to eyewitness
Cecilia Servañez, her testimony was corroborated not only by Falqueza but also
by rebuttal witness Arriola.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Bragaes’ contention that <span style="">he
</span>was merely in the scene of the crime as the people were scampering away
is a drawback rather than a buttress to his defense.  To <span style="">succeed as </span>a
defense, alibi, which is the weakest of defenses and the easiest to fabricate,
must be propped up not only by proof that the accused was at some other place
at the crucial time but that it was physically impossible for him to <span style="">have </span>been at the crime scene.<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
Add to this is the fact that Bragaes was positively identified as the one who
stabbed Fetalino.  As a matter of law,
positive identification prevails over an alibi.<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery was correctly considered by the trial court as a
circumstance which attended the killing.  Fetalino, who knew that Numeron had an ax to grind against him, clearly
acted on the belief that he was running away from knife-wielding Numeron.  He did not anticipate that death would <span style="">come not </span>from the hands of Numeron, but
those of Bragaes.  This is reflected in Fetalino's
reaction when he realized he had been wounded:  he asked Bragaes why he stabbed him when they had no quarrel.  As Fetalino was totally unprepared for the
unexpected attack from his back and having no weapon to resist it, the stabbing
cannot but be considered as treacherous.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a> The
presence of treachery qualified the killing of Fetalino to murder under Article
248 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There was conspiracy
between Numeron and Bragaes.  Even
without direct evidence of their criminal agreement, conspiracy may be inferred
from their joint acts toward a common purpose.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Although Bragaes tried to exculpate himself
by passing the buck to Numeron, his own testimony clearly reveals the veracity
of the prosecution version of the commission of the crime.   Thus, on cross-examination, the following
facts were elicited from him:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.  To summarize then, Nestorio (sic) Numeron
made a sign of cutting his throat with <span style="">his
</span>forefinger and then Gabriel Fetalino bumped you at the back and
immediately followed by Nestorio Numeron passing in front of you whereupon you
pushed Nestorio Numeron and when Gabriel Fetalino passed by you he was already
wounded and dropped near the school gate of Calatrava High School, <span style="">is </span>that not the sequence of your
answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir." (TSN, May 12, 1982, pp.
58-59).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That Bragaes would put in
execution Numeron's signal to him is explained by the fact that, although he
denied it in court, he was beholden to Numeron who had not only employed him
but had taken him in his own abode.  As
Bragaes himself expressed in his letter to Violeta,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> she was right in telling him that he
harbored the wrong belief </span>that he <span style="">should
give his life to someone in the name of friendship (" x x x tama ang sabi
mo na mali ang aking katuwiran na ang buong buhay ko ay ibibigay ko lamang sa
isang kaibigan alang alang sa pakikisama x x x ").  Bragaes’ distorted expression of gratitude
however, seemed not to have entirely satisfied Numeron who still offered him
P5,000 while they were detained just so Numeron and his paramour would be
cleared of the murder charge.  It is not
surprising then that during their detention their friendship turned into
animosity that Bragaes was prepared to tell lies in order to pin responsi­bility
for the murder of Fetalino on Numeron.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot, however, agree
with the trial court that Gemina was part of the conspiracy.  The evidence at hand from which her being a
conspirator may be inferred, consists of Cecilia Servañez’s testimony that
after the fistfight between Numeron and Fetalino, Gemina conferred for ten
minutes with Numeron and Bragaes.  Admitting that the conversation </span>was <span style="">inaudible from her position outside of Gemina's house, Cecilia failed
to divulge what the three were talking about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Mere knowledge,
acquiescence to or approval of the act without cooperation or agreement to
cooperate, is not enough to constitute one a party to a conspiracy absent the
intentional participation in the act with a view to the furtherance of the
common design and purpose.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It should be observed that during the
incident which started from the time Numeron jumped out of the window until
Bragaes stabbed Fetalino, there </span>was <span style="">no evidence on what Gemina did to pursue whatever the accused allegedly
</span>discussed inside her house.  Gemina only entered the scene when, after the stabbing of Fetalino, she
was seen by Cecilia standing by the stairs of her own house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged handing of the death weapon of Bragaes to Gemina,
being uncorroborated, may not be given the evidentiary weight that may
prejudice Gemina.  This <span style="">case </span>should be distinguished from <b>People
vs. Madali</b><a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the Court considered the wife of the accused policeman as an
accomplice.  In said case, Annie Madali
performed positive acts of participa­tion <span style="">in
</span>the shooting incident by beaming her flashlight at the victims so that
her husband could take a good aim and warning her husband of the presence of
other persons in the vicinity.  In the
instant case, however, there is no proof that Gemina handed Bragaes the death
weapon before the commission of the crime.  The uncorroborated testimony of Cecilia Servañez that as Bragaes gave
Gemina the knife, he said "Ito na ang ibinigay mo sa akin kanina, itago
mo" may not be considered as proof beyond reasonable doubt that Gemina in
fact gave Bragaes the knife to be used in stabbing Fetalino.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not blind to the fact that it was Gemina's boisterous
quarrel with Fetalino which triggered the chain of events leading to Fetalino's
murder.  However, the evidence at hand
are simply not adequate to overcome the presumption that Gemina was innocent of
the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, insofar as Rodolfo Bragaes is concerned the
decision of the lower court imposing the penalty of <span style="">reclusion perpetua </span>is hereby AFFIRMED subject to the modification
that he shall indemnify the <span style="">heirs </span>of
