				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In an Information dated October 17, 1989, filed with the Regional
Trial Court, Branch XXVII of Catbalogan, Samar,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
accused-appellant, Antonio Danque y Dando and a John Doe were charged with
Murder, committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“That on or about the 12th day of August, 1989, along Maharlika
Highway, at Barangay New Mahayag, Municipality of Catbalogan, Province of
Samar, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping
one another with John Doe, who is still at large and whose identity is still
unknown, with deliberate intent to kill, with treachery and evident
premeditation and abuse of superior strength, did then and there wilfully,
unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, hold, stab and hack one Vivencio
Lucaban with a bolo with which the said accused had conveniently provided
themselves for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon said Vivencio Lucaban ‘stab
and hacking wounds’ in the different parts of his body, which wounds strictly
caused his death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“CONTRARY TO LAW.” (Rollo, p. 16)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the
crime are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 12, 1989, at around 5:30 in the afternoon, Lydia
Lucaban was in the house of Vicente Mabingay at Barangay San Vicente, Maharlika
Highway, Catbalogan, Samar. She was waiting for her husband, Vivencio Lucaban,
who went to the adjacent barangay of New Mahayag to buy some fish. After a long
wait, she decided to follow him. Walking on her way to Barangay New Mahayag,
she suddenly saw, from a distance of about 100 meters, an unidentified person
holding the hands of her husband Vivencio.  She also saw another person, whom she recognized as the
accused-appellant Antonio Danque y Dando, deliver a hacking blow on her
defenseless husband. Her husband then fell on the ground.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> After
witnessing the incident, she hid in the bushes where she lost consciousness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
When she regained consciousness, she hurriedly went home. Her brother-in-law
and a policeman fetched her and accompanied her to the Samar Provincial
Hospital where her husband’s lifeless body was subsequently brought.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Previous to the hacking incident, Lydia Lucaban had known the
accused-appellant for more than a year. Lydia and her husband were living with
her aunt, Mrs. Marcing Longara, at the latter’s house while accused-appellant’s
house was adjacent to theirs.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lydia testified that the accused-appellant had a long-standing
grudge against her husband. Accused-appellant resented it when her aunt, Mrs.
Longara, turned over her land to Vivencio. In one instance, the accused-appellant
even prevented them from harvesting coconuts on said land. The
accused-appellant drew a bolo and faced her husband who was then carrying a
scythe. She tried to pacify Vivencio who instead ran towards their house and
got a lead pipe.  Frightened, the
accused-appellant scampered away.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another eyewitness to the incident is Monico Bola. He testified
that on the said date and time, he was gathering firewood in the coconut
plantation owned by Floro Yboa. The plantation, situated along Maharlika Highway,
is just across the road from the scene of the crime. While tying the firewood,
he heard a voice crying for help, shouting that he was about to be killed. He
looked across the street and saw a person, whose identity is unknown to him,
holding both hands of Vivencio Lucaban. He also saw the accused-appellant hack
Vivencio three (3) times. Vivencio fell on the ground after receiving the
hacking blows. He did not answer the victim’s call for help for he was afraid.
Neither did he did go near the scene of the crime. He just picked up the
firewood and went home.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Bola further confirmed that prior to the hacking incident,
accused-appellant had an altercation with Vivencio.  At one time, while Bola and the accused-appellant were on their
way to Barangay New Mahayag, the latter boasted that although smaller in built,
he could easily beat Vivencio and he would not give any second thought on
killing anyone.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, the accused-appellant offered the defense of alibi.
He testified that from June 15, 1989 to August 12, 1989, he was in Biliran,
Leyte, gathering shells known as “sarad.” He was then accompanied by Paquito
Senogat (owner of the motorboat they were using) and a certain Jimmy (who
operated the boat).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
His alibi was corroborated by Paquito Senogat.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant denied knowing Lydia Lucaban. Thus, he claimed,
he could not have harbored any ill-feelings towards her. He averred that he
voluntarily vacated the land of Mrs. Longara because he had become sickly.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the trial court convicted the
accused-appellant. The dispositive portion of the Decision of conviction reads:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, finding the accused Antonio Danque, guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, for the treacherous and premeditated
killing of Vivencio Lucaban, but taking into consideration the provisions of
the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of
imprisonment of from twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
as minimum, to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day also of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> as maximum; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the
integrated amount of P50,000.00, but without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency, and to pay the costs of the case.” (Rollo, at pp. 23-24)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the penalty imposed upon him by the trial court,
accused Danque appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals. In a decision
dated November 27, 1992,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> the
Court of Appeals affirmed the factual findings of the trial court but ruled
that the imposable penalty is <i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reclusion</span></u></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>perpetua</u></span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>there being no mitigating or
aggravating circumstance. Hence, the appellate court refrained from
promulgating its Decision and certified the case to this Court for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, accused-appellant impugns the credibility of the
prosecution witnesses. It is insisted that it was unnatural for Lydia Lucaban
to ignore her husband’s cry for help upon seeing him under attack by the
accused-appellant.  Likewise, accused-appellant
denigrates the testimony of Bola for his failure to report the hacking incident
to the police authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">These issues have been sufficiently addressed by the Court of
Appeals, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Witness Lydia Lucaban explained that she did not shout for help nor
run to the rescue of her husband because she was afraid that she might also be
killed. The fact cannot be discounted that people react differently to similar
situations (People v. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Gutierrez, Jr.,
158 SCRA 614). There is no standard form of behaviour when one is confronted by
a shocking incident (People v. Radomes, 141 SCRA 546).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“With regard to witness Monico Bola, it bears stressing that the
initial reluctance of a witness to testify in a case and his unwillingness to
be involved or dragged in an investigation are a common occurrence in this
country and such reluctance therefore does not affect his credibility (People
v. Aliocod, 167 SCRA 665).”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We add that survival was and still remains the first law of man.
Lydia Lucaban has reason to fear for her safety. She belongs to the weaker sex
and any effort on her part to help Vivencio would amount to nothing but raw and
reckless courage.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the trial court cannot be faulted for electing to accord
credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and to disbelieve that
of the accused-appellant. Inconsistencies and contradictions characterized the
short testimony of the accused-appellant and his corroborating witness, Paquito
Senogat. During the trial, accused-appellant denied having known Lydia Lucaban
and he claimed that the first time he met her was during his arraignment. This
was ostensibly to blunt the testimony that he harbored ill-feelings towards
her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In the same breath, however, he admitted he was a tenant-farmer in the land of
Mrs. Longara, in whose house Vivencio and Lydia were residing. As neighbors,
and considering that Lydia was the niece of his landlady, accused-appellant’s
pretense that Lydia was a stranger to him prior to the trial of the case is
unworthy of belief. Moreover, going over the entire testimony of the accused-appellant,
it will be gleaned that the latter was not even sure whether he arrived at
Catbalogan, Samar on August 12 or 13, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of accused-appellant’s corroborating witness,
Paquito Senogat, is similarly pockmarked with incredulities. His brief
testimony did not strengthen the veracity of appellant’s alibi. Senogat
declared that the accused-appellant was with him and his nephew, Kiko Senogat,
on that fateful day of August 12, 1989. In his testimony however,
accused-appellant himself made no mention of the fact that a certain Kiko
Senogat was with them. Instead, accused-appellant testified that on August 12,
1989, he was out in the sea with Paquito Senogat and a certain Jimmy. This
variance in their testimonies relate to a material detail and weakens
considerably the credence of Senogat.</p>

<p class="BODY">In checkered contrast, the records show that the testimony of
Monico Bola deserves full faith and credit. Accused-appellant himself admitted
he knew Bola since they worked together in the farm of Mrs. Longara.
Accused-appellant failed to show any motive why Bola would lie and maliciously
impute on him the commission of such a heinous crime. As the trial court
correctly observed, it would have been easy for Bola to refuse to testify on
what he witnessed that day, but he did not. He chose to testify and put himself
in physical danger or threat in doing so. Neither was there any attempt to show
that Bola testified due to a promise of reward or consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The time-tested jurisprudence is that the findings and
conclusions of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses enjoy a badge of
respect for the reason that trial courts have the advantage of observing the
demeanor of witnesses as they testify. In the case at bar, accused-appellant
has not shown any compelling reason why this rule of logic and experience
should not be observed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the trial court correctly disbelieved the defense of
alibi proffered by the accused-appellant. Alibi cannot prevail over the
positive and categorical testimony of the two (2) prosecution witnesses that it
was the accused-appellant who perpetrated the crime at bar.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the appreciation of the qualifying circumstances
alleged in the Information. Three (3) qualifying circumstances were alleged, <u>viz</u>:
treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength. The
well-entrenched rule is that a qualifying circumstance must be proven as
clearly as the crime itself.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> It
cannot be deduced from debatable inferences.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, We find that treachery qualified the killing
of Vivencio to murder. There is treachery when the offender commits any of the
crimes against persons, employing means, methods and forms in the execution
thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution without risk
to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The manner in which the victim was assaulted by the two (2)
accused sufficiently established the existence of treachery.  Vivencio’s hands were held by appellant’s
co-conspirator which effectively rendered him defenseless from
accused-appellant’s hacking blows. It afforded the two (2) accused an
opportunity to kill Vivencio without risk to their lives.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation
should not have been appreciated by the trial court against the
accused-appellant. For evident premeditation to be considered, convincing proof
of the following elements is necessary: (1) the time when the offender
determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the
offender had clung to his determination; and (3) the lapse of an interval of
time between the determination to commit the crime and execution thereof,
sufficient to allow the offender to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
As we held in the early case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Durante</u> (53
Phil. 363), the essence of premeditation is that the execution of the criminal
act must be preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to
carry out the criminal intent during a space of time sufficient to arrive at a
calm judgment. The prosecution only proved that there was a previous
altercation between the victim and the accused-appellant. This evidence may
explain the reason for the murder of the victim by the accused-appellant, but
without more, it could not prove evident premeditation. On the whole, the
evidence lacks the specifics of time from which can be deduced the studied
deliberation on the part of the accused-appellant to commit the offense at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the trial court erred in considering the qualifying
circumstance of taking advantage of superior strength against the
accused-appellant. This aggravating circumstance was absorbed by treachery.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed in this case is Murder qualified by
treachery. There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstance, the medium
penalty of <i><u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u></i> should be imposed on the
accused-appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><i>WHEREFORE</i></b>, the decision appealed from is hereby
MODIFIED and the accused-appellant is hereby found guilty of Murder qualified by
treachery and meted the penalty of <i><u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u></i> and
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Vivencio Lucaban the sum of fifty
thousand pesos (P50,000.00), but without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency and to pay the cost of the suit.</p>
