<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pertinent facts

Palanas, Masbate and reported to the police authorities what accused Felipe and
Titing Maloloy-on did to his wife.

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it having been established beyond reasonable doubt
that accused Felipe Maloloy-on committed the offense charged with the aid of
his son Titing Maloloy-on (who is now allegedly dead) employing superior
strength qualified by treachery in the process which aggravating circumstance
is not off-set by any mitigating circumstance, said Felipe Maloloy-on is
penalized under Par. 1 of Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code and is
sentenced to the extreme penalty of reclusion perpetua; to indemnify the heirs
of the victim in the sum of P12,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case
of insolvency; to suffer the accessory penalties provided for by law; and to
proportionately pay the costs.</blockquote>

imprisonment; and until it shall have been satisfactorily established that
accused Titing Maloloy-on is now really dead, the case against him is ordered
archived and an alias warrant issued."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In

where appellant assigns the following reversible errors, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.  The lower court gravely erred in convicting
accused-appellant of the crime of murder despite the prosecution's failure to
prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt and in not acquitting
accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.  The lower court gravely erred in giving
weight and credence to the otherwise highly improbable, incredible and
ill-motivated testimonies of prosecution witnesses Gerardo Tambago, Pfc.
Gregorio Tamayo and Artemio Abenir.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.  The lower court gravely erred in
appreciating in evidence the petroleum container (Exh. "B") and hat
(Exh. "C") adduced by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.  The lower court gravely erred in concluding
that accused-appellant's alleged acts of shouting unintelligible words,
defecating on the floor and attempting to escape from detention are indicative
of his guilt of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.  The trial court gravely erred in
discrediting accused-appellant's defense of alibi.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">6.  The trial court gravely erred in finding
that the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and treachery
are attendant in the case at bar.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We affirm, with
modification, the decision appealed from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As against the clear,
direct and positive identification of Gerardo Tambago that he saw the accused
dragging the lifeless body of his wife, the alibi of appellant Felipe
Maloloy-on cannot prevail.  While it is
true that the defense of alibi may sometimes be considered exculpatory, as when
the participation of the appellant is not established beyond cavil,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> it is equally settled that for alibi to
succeed it must be shown not only that accused was at some other place at the
time of the alleged crime and that it was physically impossible for him to have
been at the site of the crime at the time of its commission either before or
after the time he was at such other place.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> If the required physical impossibility of
being present at the scene of the crime is not proved, alibi as a defense
becomes unavailing to the accused.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the instant case,
appellant himself admitted that at or about the time when the crime was
committed, he was at his farm in Sitio Basyao, Jose Abenir, Sr., Palanas,
Masbate.  It appears that his farm is
only one (1) kilometer away from the coconut plantation where the deceased was
killed,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> an easily traversable distance.  There was thus no physical impossibility of
his being present at the <u>locus</u> <u>criminis</u> at the time the crime was
committed.  It will likewise be observed
that his defense of alibi was corroborated only by </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">wife and mother-in-law.  Such
corroboration by his close relatives, constrains us to receive the same with
extreme</span> caution, considering the added facility of its fabrication.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, there is
nothing the records to show that Gerardo Tambago was motivated to testify
falsely against appellant.  There </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">also no possibility that he could have been mistaken in the identity of
appellant for, apart from being at the scene of the crime, he also knew
appellant very </span>well since they are residents of the same place.  In fact, appellant also admitted having
known Gerardo Tambago for a <span style="">long time.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the absence of any proof that the
principal prosecution witness acted because of improper motive, the presumption
is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full faith and
credit.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> What appears instead as a strong probable
cause for the actuations </span>of both accused is the fact that Gerardo
Tambago and his wife caught the children of appellant stealing bundles of
firewood from the former's coconut plantation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant's claim that on
July 4, 1985, he was accompanied by Barangay Captain Artemio Abenir to recover
his carabao at the Municipal Hall of Palanas was belied by the latter himself who
denied having gone with appellant to the </span>municipal hall.  Said public official testified, on the <span style="">contrary, </span>that appellant came to him
to surrender.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant also posits that it is highly improbable for a husband not to lend
succor to his wife whose life is under threat or danger.  Gerardo Tambago's failure to come to the
rescue of his wife was understandable.  He was naturally shocked and taken aback by such unexpected and
frightful occurrence.  He was unarmed,
with nobody around to help him, and there were no houses near the creek where
his wife was thrown.  However, after
regaining his composure, he immediately rushed to the poblacion and reported
the incident to the police authorities.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a> This
was confirmed by Pfc. Gregorio Tamayo.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Gerardo Tambago was the
only eyewitness to the surrounding circumstances of the heinous crime upon
which the </span>guilt of appellant may be established.  While it has been said that the
identification of the offender is crucial in every criminal prosecution when
the defense pleads alibi, and in such a case the identity of the culprit must
be established beyond reasonable doubt,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> we
are satisfied that there has been an indisputable identification of the accused
in this case.  To repeat, prosecution
key witness Gerardo Tambago knew appellant very well and where the latter
resided.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
His having witnessed the two accused dragging the lifeless body of his wife and
running away after he shouted at them indubitably establish the appellant's
criminal participation.  As earlier
explained, prior to the incident in question, the children of appellant
including his co-accused son were at the premises where the crime was
committed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">True, the foregoing
closely-knit narration of events came from the sole eyewitness.  Nevertheless, we accord full credence to his
testimony for the reasons hereinbefore stated, bolstered by the fact that his
testimony on the fatal </span>injuries of his wife which he saw and immediately
reported was subsequently corroborated by the post-mortem examination conducted
by Dr. Primitivo Monterde.  The
testimony of a lone eyewitness <span style="">is </span>sufficient
to convict the accused where it was given in a straightforward manner and it
was full of details which by their nature could not have been merely
invented.  In determining the
sufficiency of evidence, what matters is not the number of witnesses but the
credibility, nature and quality of the testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The other remaining
errors assigned by appellant hinge on and may be subsumed under the issue of
credibility.  We accordingly reiterate
the time-honored rule that the findings of the trial judge, who had the better
opportunity to observe the witnesses, assess their demeanor on the stand and
evaluate their respective testimonies, should generally be entitled to great
weight unless the court has plainly overlooked the undisputed facts of
substance and value that if properly considered would affect the result of the
case.  We do not find any such excepting
feature in this case </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">would detract from the application of said
doctrinal rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find, however, that
the court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo</u> <span style="">erred
in appreciating the circumstances of treachery and abuse of superior strength
to qualify and aggravate the liability of appellant.  Although both circumstances are alleged in the information, they
were not shown beyond reasonable doubt to have been employed by appellant.  There was no testimony on the actual nature
and mode of the attack on the hapless victim, much less to show that treachery
was deliberately adopted to ensure the infliction of the fatal wounds.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> For the same reason, there is likewise no
evidence of the respective or joint participation of the two accused in
assaulting the victim, much less that they took advantage of their superior
strength.  Mere superiority in the
number of assailants, and nothing more, does not constitute the circumstance of
abuse of superior strength.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Furthermore, </span>superior strength is
inherent and absorbed in treachery<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
which, latter circumstance, however, was not proved in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant Felipe
Maloloy-on can, therefore, be convicted only of homicide.  While there is testimony that appellant
supposedly asked the barangay captain to accompany him to the municipal
building to surrender, this mitigating circumstance was not appreciated by the
trial court obviously because of the conflicting versions thereon.  More to the point, appellant stoutly
maintains in his brief that he did not surrender to the police authorities on
July 4, 1985, but that he merely went to the municipal building to retrieve his
</span>impounded carabao.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender cannot be
credited in favor of appellant, with the result that <u>sans</u> any modifying
circumstance, the medium period of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, or <span style="">fourteen </span>(14) years, eight (8) months
and one (1) day to seventeen (17) years and four (4) months, should be imposed
on appellant, with the corresponding application of the Indeterminate Sentence
Law.</p>
