				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner spouses George and Librada Moran are the owners of the
Wack-Wack Petron gasoline station located at Shaw Boulevard, corner Old
Wack-Wack Road, Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.  They regularly purchased bulk fuel and other related products from
Petrophil Corporation on cash on delivery (COD) basis.  Orders for bulk fuel and other related
products were made by telephone and payments were effected by personal checks
upon delivery.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintained three joint accounts, namely one current
account (No. 37-00066-7) and two savings accounts, (Nos. 1037002387 and
1037001372) with the Shaw Boulevard branch of Citytrust Banking
Corporation.  As a special privilege to
the Morans, whom it considered as valued clients, the bank allowed them to
maintain a zero balance in their current account.  Transfers from Savings Account No. 1037002387 to their current
account could be made only with their prior authorization, but they gave
written authority to Citytrust to automatically transfer funds from their
Savings Account No. 1037001372 to their Current Account No. 37-00068-7 at any
time whenever the funds in their current account were insufficient to meet
withdrawals from said current account.  Such arrangement for automatic transfer of funds was called a
pre-authorized transfer (PAT) agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The PAT letter-agreement entered into by the parties on March 19,
1982 contained the following provisions:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  The transfer may be effected on the day
following the overdrawing of the current account, <i>but the check/s would be
honored if the savings account has sufficient balance to cover the overdraft</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  The regular charges on overdraft, and
activity fees will be imposed by the Bank.<i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

refuse to effect transfer of funds at our sole and absolute option and
discretion</i>, reserving our right to terminate this arrangement at any time
without written notice to you.<i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 12, 1983, petitioners, through Librada Moran, drew a
check (Citytrust No. 041960) for P50,576.00 payable to Petrophil Corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The next day, December 13, 1983, petitioners, again through Librada Moran,
issued another check (Citytrust No. 041962) in the amount of P56,090.00 in
favor of the same corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> The
total sum of the two checks was P106,666.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1983, Petrophil Corporation deposited the two
aforementioned checks to its account with the Pandacan branch of the Philippine
National Bank (PNB), the collecting bank.  In turn, PNB, Pandacan branch presented them for clearing with the
Philippine Clearing House Corporation in the afternoon of the same day.  The records show that on December 14, 1983,
Current Account No. 37-00066-7 had a zero <span style="">b</span>alance,
while Savings Account No. 1037001372 (covered by the PAT) had an available
balance of P26,104.30<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> a</span>nd S<span style="">avings </span>Account No. 1037002387 had an available balance of

<p class="BODY">At about ten o’clock in the morning of the following day,
December 15, <span style="">1983, </span>petitioner
George Moran went to the bank, as was his regular practice, to personally
oversee their daily transactions with the bank.  He deposited in their Savings Account No. 1037002387 the amounts
of P10,874.58 and P6,754.25,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> </span></i>and he likewise deposited in
their Savings Account No. 1037001372 the amounts of P5,900.00, P35,100.00 and
P30.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The amount of P40,000.00 was then
transferred by <span style="">him<i> </i></span>from
Savings Account No. 1037002387 to their current account by means of a <i><span style="">pro forma </span></i>withdrawal form (a debit
memorandum), which was provided by the bank, authorizing the latter to make the
necessary transfer.  At the same time,
the amount of P66,666.00 was transferred from Savings Account No. 1037001372 to
the same current account through the pre-authorized transfer (PAT) agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime on December 15 or 16, 1983, George Moran was informed by
his wife, Librada, that Petrophil refused to deliver their orders on a credit
basis because the two checks they had previously issued were dishonored upon
presentment for payment.  Apparently,
the bank dishonored the checks due to “insufficiency of funds.”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The non-delivery of gasoline forced petitioners to temporarily stop business
operations, allegedly causing them to suffer loss of earnings.  In addition, Petrophil cancelled their
credit accommodation, forcing them to pay for their purchases in cash.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
George Moran, furious and upset, demanded an explanation from Raul Diaz, the
branch manager.  Failing to get a
sufficient explanation, he talked to a certain Villareal, a bank officer, who
allegedly told him that Amy Belen Ragodo, the customer service officer, had
committed a “grave error.”<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 16 or 17, 1983, Diaz went to the Moran residence to
get the signatures of petitioners on an application for a manager’s check so
that the dishonored checks could be redeemed. Diaz then went to Petrophil to
personally present the checks in payment for the two dishonored checks.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a chance meeting around May or June, 1984, George Moran
learned from one Constancio Magno, credit manager of Petrophil, that the latter
received from Citytrust, through Diaz, a letter dated December 16, 1983,
notifying them that the two aforementioned checks were “inadvertently,
dishonored x x x due to operational error.” Said letter was received by
Petrophil on January 4, 1984.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 24, 1984, or a little over six months after the incident,
petitioners, through counsel, wrote Citytrust claiming that the bank’s dishonor
of the checks caused them besmirched business and personal reputation, shame
and anxiety, hence they were contemplating the filing of the necessary legal
actions unless the bank issued a certification clearing their name and paid
them P1,000,000.00 as moral damages<span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The bank did not act favorably on their demands, hence
petitioners filed a complaint for damages on September 8, 1984, with the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 159 at Pasig, Metro Manila, which was docketed therein
as Civil Case No. 51549.  In turn,
Citytrust filed a counterclaim for damages, alleging that the case filed
against it was unfounded and unjust.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, a decision dated October 9, 1989 was rendered by the
trial court dismissing both the complaint and the counterclaim.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
On appeal, the Court of Appeals rendered judgment in CA-G.R. CV No. 25009 on
October 9, 1989 affirming the decision of the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We start with some basic and accepted rules, statutory and
doctrinal.  A check is a bill of
exchange drawn on a bank payable on demand.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, a check is a written order addressed to a bank or persons carrying on the
business of banking, by a party having money in their hands, requesting them to
pay on presentment, to a person named therein or to bearer or order, a named
sum of money.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Fixed savings and current deposits of money in banks and similar
institutions shall be governed by the provisions concerning simple loan.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, the relationship between the bank and the depositor is that of
a debtor and creditor.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> By
virtue of the contract of deposit between the banker and its depositor, the
banker agrees to pay checks drawn by the depositor provided that said depositor
has money in the hands of the bank.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, where the bank possesses funds of a depositor, it is bound
to honor his checks to the extent of the amount of his deposits.  The failure of a bank to pay the check of a
merchant or a trader, when the deposit is sufficient, entitles the drawer to
substantial damages without any proof of actual damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Conversely, a bank is not liable for its refusal to pay a check
on account of insufficient funds, notwithstanding the fact that a deposit may
be made later in the day.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Before a bank depositor may maintain a suit to recover a specific amount from
his bank, he must first show that he had on deposit sufficient funds to meet
his demand.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The present action for damages accordingly hinges on the
resolution of the inquiry as to whether or not petitioners had sufficient funds
in their accounts when the bank dishonored the checks in question.  In view of the factual findings of the two
lower courts the correctness of which are challenged by what appear to be
plausible arguments, we feel that the same should properly be resolved by
us.  This would necessarily require us
to inquire into both the savings and current accounts of petitioners in
relation to the PAT arrangement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1983, when PNB, Pandacan branch, presented the
checks for collection, the available balance for Savings Account No. 1037001372
was P26,104.30 while Current Account No. 37-00066-7 expectedly had a zero
balance.  On December 15, 1983, at
approximately ten o’clock in the morning, petitioners, through George Moran,
learned that P66,666.00 from Savings Account No. 1037001372 was transferred to
their current account.  Another
P40,000.00 was transferred from Savings Account No. 1037002387 to the current
account.  Considering that the transfers
were by then sufficient to cover the two checks, it is asserted by petitioners
that such fact should have prevented the dishonor of the checks.  It appears, however, that it was not so.</p>

<p class="BODY">As explained by respondent court in its decision, Gerard E.
Rionisto, head of the centralized clearing unit of Citytrust, detailed on the
witness stand the standard clearing procedure adopted by respondent bank and
the Philippine Clearing House Corporation, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>Q:  Let me again re-phrase the question.  Most of (sic) these two checks issued by
Mrs. Librada Moran under the accounts of the plaintiffs with Citytrust Banking
Corporation were drawn dated December 12, 1983 and December 13, 1983 (and)
these two (2) checks were made payable to Petrophil Corporation.  On record, Petrophil Corporation presented
these two (2) checks for clearing with PNB Pandacan Branch on December 14,
1983.  Now in accordance with the bank,
what would happen with these checks drawn with (sic) PNB on December 14, 1983?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:  <i style="">So
these checks will now be presented by PNB with the Philippine Clearing House on
December 14, and then the Philippine Clearing House will process it until
midnight of December 14.  Citytrust will
send a clearing representative to the Philippine Clearing House at around 2:00
o’clock in the morning of December 15 and then get the checks.   The checks will now be processed at the
Citytrust Computer at around 3:00 o’clock in the morning of December 14 (sic)
but it will be processed for balance of Citytrust as of December 14 because for
one, we have not opened on December 15 at 3:00 o’clock.  Under the clearing house rules, we are
supposed to process it on the date it was presented for clearing.  </i>(tsn, September 9, 1988, pp. 9-10).<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the clearing process adopted, as explained in the
aforequoted testimony, it is clear that the available balance on December 14,
1983 was used by the bank in determining whether or not there was sufficient
cash deposited to fund the two checks, although what was stamped on the dorsal
side of the two checks in question was “DAIF/12-15-83,” since December 15, 1983
was the actual date when the, checks were processed.  As earlier stated, when petitioners’ checks were dishonored due
to insufficiency of funds, the available balance of Savings Account No.
1037001372, which was the subject of the PAT agreement, was not enough to cover
either of the two checks.  On December
14, 1983, when PNB, Pandacan branch presented the checks for collection, the
available balance for Savings Account No. 1037001372, to repeat, was only P26,104.30
<span style="">while </span>Current Account No.
37-0006-7 had no available balance.  It
was only on December 15, 1983 at around ten o’clock in the morning that the
necessary funds were deposited, which unfortunately was too late to prevent the
dishonor of the checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that public respondent, by relying heavily on
Rionisto’s testimony, failed to consider the fact that the witness himself
admitted that he had no personal knowledge surrounding the dishonor of the two
checks in question.  Thus, although he
knew the standard clearing procedure, it does not necessarily mean that the
same procedure was adopted with regard to the two checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.  Section
3(q), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court provides a disputable presumption in law
that the ordinary course of business has been followed.  In the absence of a contrary showing, it is
presumed that the acts in question were in conformity with the usual conduct of
business.  In the case at bar,
petitioners failed to present countervailing evidence to rebut the presumption
that the checks involved underwent the same regular process for clearing of
checks followed by the bank since 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners had no reason to complain, for they alone were at
fault.  A drawer must remember his
responsibilities every time he issues a check.  He must personally keep track of his available balance in the bank and
not rely on the bank to notify him of the necessity to fund certain checks he
previously issued.  A check, as
distinguished from an ordinary bill of exchange, is supposed to be drawn
against a <i>previous deposit of funds </i>for it is ordinarily intended for
immediate payment.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, between the time of the issuance of said checks on
December 12 and 13 and the time of their presentment on December 14,
petitioners had, at the very least, twenty-four hours to replenish their
balances in the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">As previously noted, it was only during business hours in the
morning of December 15, 1983, that P66,666.00 was automatically transferred
from Savings Account No. 1037001372 to Current Account No. 37-00066-7, and
another P40,000.00 was transferred from Savings Account No. 1037002387 to the
same current account by a debit memorandum.  Petitioners argue that if indeed the checks were dishonored in the early
morning of December 15, 1983, the bank would not have automatically transferred
P66,666.00 to said current account.  They theorize that the checks having already been dishonored, there was
no necessity to put into effect the pre-authorized transfer agreement.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That theory is incorrect.  When the transfers from both savings accounts to the current account
were made, they were done in the hope that the checks may be retrieved, thus
preventing their dishonor.  Unfortunately, respondent bank did not succeed in effectuating its good
intentions.  The transfers were made to
preserve its relations with petitioners whom knew were valued clients, hence it
wanted to prevent the dishonor of their checks, if the same was at all
possible.  Although not admitting fault,
it tried its best to make sure that the checks would not bounce.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under similar circumstances, it was held <span style="">in </span><i>Whitman vs. First National Bank</i><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that a bank performs its full duty
where, upon the receipt of a check drawn against an account in which there are
insufficient funds to pay it in full, it endeavors to induce the drawer to make
good his account so that the check <span style="">can </span>be
paid, and failing in this, it protests the check on the following morning and
notifies its correspondent bank by telegraph of the protest.  It cannot, therefore, be held liable to the
payee and holder of the check for not protesting it upon the day when it was
received.  In fact, the court added that
the bank did more than it was required to do by making an effort to induce the
drawer to deposit sufficient money to make the check good, and by notifying its
correspondent of the dishonor of the check by telegram.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintain that at the time the checks were dishonored,
they had already deposited sufficient funds to cover said checks.  To prove their point, petitioners quoted in
their petition the following testimony of said witness Rionisto, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>Q:  Now according to you, you would receive the checks from (being deposited
to) the collecting bank which in this particular example, was the Pandacan
Branch of PNB which in turn will deliver it to the Philippine Clearing House
and the Philippine Clearing House will deliver it to your office around 12:00
o’clock in the evening of December...?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
2:00 o’clock of December 15.  We sent a
clearing representative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
the checks will be processed in accordance with the balance available as of
December 14?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
naturally you will place there “drawn against insufficient funds, December 14,
1983”?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q: <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are
you sure about that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
<span style="">sir.  </span>x x x (tsn<span style="">, September 9,
1988, P. 14).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, witness Rionisto was merely confused as to the dates
(December 14 and 15) because it did not jibe with his previous testimony,
wherein he categorically stated that “the checks will now be processed at the
Citytrust Computer at around 3:00 in the morning of December 14 (sic) but it
will be processed for balance of Citytrust as of December 14 because for one,
we have not opened on December 15 at 3:00 o-clock. Under the clearing house
rules, we are supposed to process it on the date it was presented for
clearing.”<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Analyzing the procedure he had previously explained, and analyzing his
testimony in its entirety and not in truncated portions, it would logically and
ineluctably appear that he actually meant December 15, and not December 14.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the early morning of every business day, prior to banking
hours, the various branches of Citytrust would receive a computer printout
called the “rejected transactions” report from the head office.  The report contains, among others, a listing
of “checks to be funded.” When Citytrust, Shaw Boulevard branch, received said
report in the early morning of December 15, 1983, the two checks involved were
included in the “checks to be funded.” That report was used by the bank as its
basis in dishonoring the two checks in question.  Petitioner contends that the bank erred when it did so because on
previous occasions, the report was merely used by the bank as a basis for
determining whether or not it was necessary to notify them of the need to
deposit certain amounts in their accounts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Amy Belen Rogado, a bank employee, testified that she would
normally copy the details stated in the report and transfer it on a “pink
slip.” These pink slips were then given to George Moran.  In turn, George Moran testified that he
would deposit the necessary funds stated in the pink slips.  As a matter of fact, so petitioner
asseverated, not a single check written on the notices was ever dishonored
after he had funded said checks with the bank.  Thus, petitioner argues, the checks were not yet dishonored after the
bank received the report in the early morning of December 15, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said argument does not persuade.  If ever petitioners on previous occasions were given notices every time
a check was presented for clearing and payment and there were no adequate funds
in their accounts, these were, at most, mere accommodations on the part of
respondent bank.  It was not a
requirement or a general banking practice, hence non-compliance therewith could
not lay the bank open to blame or rebuke.  Legally, the bank had all the right to dishonor the checks because there
were no sufficient funds to speak of in the first place.  If the demand is by check, a drawer must
have to his credit enough to cover the demand.  If his credit with the bank is less than the amount on the face of the
check, the bank may lawfully refuse payment.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuing this matter further, the bank could also not be faulted
for not accepting either of the two checks.  The first check issued was <span style="">in </span>the
amount of P50,576.00, while the second one was for P56,090.00.  Savings Account No. 1037001372 then had a
balance of only P26,104.30.  This being
the case, Citytrust could not be expected to accept for payment either one of
the two checks nor partially honor one check.</p>

<p class="BODY">A bank is under <span style="">no </span>obligation
to make part payment on a check, up to only the amount of the drawer’s funds,
where the check is drawn for an amount larger than what the drawer has on
deposit.  Such a practice of paying
checks in part has never existed.  Upon
partial payment, the check holder could not be called upon to surrender the
check, and the bank would be without a voucher affording a certain means of
showing the payment. The rule is based on commercial convenience, and any <span style="">rule </span>that would work such manifest
inconvenience should not be recognized.  A check is intended not only to transfer <span style="">a </span>right to the amount named in it, but to serve the further
purpose of affording evidence for the bank of the payment of such amount when
the check is taken up.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the <span style="">other </span>hand,
assuming <i><span style="">arguendo </span></i>that
Savings Account No. 1037002387, which is not covered by a pre-arranged
automatic transfer agreement, had enough amount deposited to cover both checks
(which is not so in this case), the bank <span style="">still
</span>had no obligation to honor said checks as there was then no authority
given to it to make the transfer of funds.  Where a depositor has two accounts with a bank, an open account and a
savings account, and draws a check upon the open account for more money than
the account contains, the bank may rightfully refuse to pay the check, and is
under no duty to make up the deficiency from the savings account.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with respondent Court of Appeals in its assessment and
interpretation of the nature of the letter of Citytrust to Petrophil, dated December
16, 1983.  As aptly and correctly stated
by said court, “x x x the letter is not an admission of liability as it was
written merely to maintain the goodwill and continued patronage of
plaintiff-appellants.  (This) cannot be
characterized as baseless, considering the totality of the circumstances
surrounding its writing”.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the actions taken by the bank after the
incident clearly show that there was neither malice nor bad faith, but rather a
clear intent to mollify an obviously agitated client.  Raul Diaz, the branch manager, even went for this purpose to the
Moran residence to facilitate their application for a manager’s check.  Later, he went to the Petrophil Corporation
to personally redeem the checks.  Still
later, the letter was sent by respondent bank to Petrophil explaining that the
dishonor of the checks was due to “operational error.” However, we reiterate,
it would be a mistake to construe that letter as an admission of guilt on the
part of the bank.  It knew that it was confronted
with a client who obviously was not willing to admit any fault on his part,
although the facts show otherwise.  Thus, respondent bank ran the risk of losing the business of an
important and influential member of the financial community if it did not do
anything to assuage the feelings of petitioners.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that the credit standing of the Morans with
Petrophil Corporation was involved, which fact, more than anything, displeased
them, to say the least.  On demand of
petitioners that their names be cleared, the bank considered it more prudent to
send the letter.  It never realized that
it would thereafter be used by petitioners as one of the bases of their legal
action.  It will be noted that there was
no reason for the bank to send the letter to Petrophil Corporation since the
latter was not a client nor was it demanding any explanation.  Clearly, therefore, the letter was merely
intended to accommodate the request of the Morans and was part of the series of
damage-control measures taken by the bark to placate petitioners.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals perceptively observed that “all these
somehow pacified plaintiffs-appellants (herein petitioners) for they did not
thereafter take immediate punitive action against the defendant-appellee (herein
private respondent). As pointed out by the court <i><span style="">a quo, </span></i>it took plaintiffs-appellants about six (6) months
after the dishonor of the checks to demand that defendant--appellee pay them
P1,000,00.00 as damages.  At that time,
plaintiffs-appellants had discovered the letter of Mr. Diaz attributing the
dishonor of their checks to ‘operational error’.  The attempt to unduly ride on the letter of Mr. Diaz speaks for
itself.”<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On the above premises which irresistibly commend themselves to
our acceptance, we find no cogent and sufficient reason to award actual, moral,
or exemplary damages to petitioners.  Although we take judicial notice of the fact that there is a fiduciary
relationship between a bank and its depositors, as well as the extent of
diligence expected of it in handling the accounts entrusted to its care,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
the bank may not be held responsible for such damages in the absence of fraud,
bad faith, malice, or wanton attitude.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
