<p class="BODY">In the morning of 21 January 1980, San Pablo City policemen found
in Dagatan Boulevard the lifeless body of a young man which bore twelve stab
wounds, including one that penetrated both the lung and the heart.  Initial reports identified the deceased as
Victor Alvaran, a seaman and a resident of San Pablo City last seen leaving his
house in the early evening of 20 January 1980 on board his father's Suzuki
motorcycle.  The motorcycle was never
found.  Two days later, however, police
authorities recovered<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>some parts
of the missing motorcycle.  With the
assistance of a number of witnesses, the investigators were able to apprehend
two of the four male suspects who were reportedly responsible for the
crime.  The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

San Pablo City, were taken in for questioning.  While the former was investigated in the police station in the night of
21 January 1980 and released on 22 January 1980, the latter remained in police
custody.  The two other suspects have
neither been apprehended nor investigated.</p>

<blockquote>The victim Victor Alvaran, now deceased, was a resident of 1st

was Victoria Alvaran, one of the prosecution witnesses.  On January 20, 1980 when the said victim
left their house, he was riding on a motorcycle, registered in the name of his
father, Orlando M. Alvaran, under Registration Certificate No. RCO-0472125,
Land Transportation Commission, San Pablo City Agency, (Exh. D) which described
the said motor vehicle as follows:<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>Yr. Model:  1979</blockquote>

<blockquote>Motor No.:  TS 1252-159446</blockquote>

<blockquote>Serial or Chassis No.:  ASC-T-125 M 00429</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the evening of January 20, 1980, the accused Martin Alvero, Jr.,
was seen inside the Seven Lakes Disco Club by Pat. Godofredo Cordero, (who went
there to pass water) wearing a blue jacket with red stripes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That same evening (Jan. 20, 1980), while Nestor Comia was in his
house at Dagatan Blvd., San Pablo City, he heard someone shouting for
help.  So he went down with his
flashlight and proceeded to the house of one Eva, 50 m. away near said Dagatan
Blvd., but he did not see any person near the said house.  When he flashed his light elsewhere, he saw
a motorcycle in front of the house of Ex­-congressman Manuel Concordia at said
boulevard.  As he approached the place,
at a distance of 30 m. away, he saw a person, he did not recognize ran (sic) to
the said motorcycle which first fell down, and then sped <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">(sic) </span>away towards the San Pablo City
Hall.  When he reached the said place,
he saw a lever motor part that was left there.  From the sound of the vehicle and from his experience as a motorcycle
mechanic, it was a susuki type motorcycle.  Comia got the lever and went home and discussed the matter with his
wife.  The following morning, there were
many persons gathered at the same place where he saw the previous night, a
motorcycle, and when he approached the place, he saw a person there who was
stabbed dead.  The police said the
victim was Victor Alvaran, and near his body a blue jacket with red stripes was
found.  The body of said victim was
examined and autopsied at the Funeraria Avenue Morgue by Asst.  City Health Officer Dra. Emma G. Brion, at
8:15 A.M. that day, January 21, 1980 and per the Necropsy Report (Exh. A, A-1)
and Anatomical sketch (Exh. B), which she prepared, there were twelve (12) stab
wounds found on the victim's body, one which (sic) was the most fatal, as it
penetrated the lung and the heart, (Exh.  A-3); said wounds could have been caused by one or different
weapons.  And the cause of death was
‘Shock and Hemorrhage Secondary To Multiple Lacerated Stabbed Wounds involving
the Lung and Heart’, (Exh. A-2).  Dra.
Brion also issued the victim's death certificate, (Exhs. C and C-1).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On Jan. 22, 1980, Pat. Ruel Tasico, upon the request of Pat. Zosimo
Tubig, went to the latter's residence, and when he arrived there, Pat. Tubig
pointed to him (Tasico) a sack in a vacant lot at Alvarez St., San Pablo City,
containing a motorcycle part, and engine block assembly (Exh. E), bearing Motor
No. TS-1252-159446.  Pat. Tasico found
also in the said sack 2 rubber handles, 1 carburetor, and 1 plastic tank oil
cover -- all parts of a motorcycle which were all recorded in the police
blotter of said police station.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>About 8:00 P.M. of said date, (Jan. 22, 1980) Ruel Atienza, a
tricycle driver, picked up accused Ruben de las Alas and Martin Alvero Jr., and
their companion whose name he does not know, in front of Renato Ortega's house
at Brgy. San Gabriel, San Pablo City.  They were carrying a sack, containing motorcycle part (sic).  Martin Alvero and his 2 companions went to
Ortega that evening, with the motorcycle parts, and before they boarded the
tricycle, Martin Alvero requested Ortega to keep the said motorcycle parts
(Exh. E) in his (Ortega) house for them but he refused and told them to go
back; so Alvero and his companions boarded Atienza's tricycle and went back,
followed by Ortega riding his own motorcycle up to Alvarez St., San Pablo City,
near the corner of Sgt. de Roma Street, where Martin Alvero and his companions
unloaded the said sack and left it there after they failed to see the person
they were looking for; thereafter, Ortega gave his statement to the police,
(Exhs. F, F-1).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On January 21, 1980, in the evening, accused Alvero was invited to
the San Pablo City Station for questioning.  He was told that he was involved in the killing of Victor Alvaran at
Sampaloc Lake.  He was released the
following morning.  One week after, he
left for Metro Manila, stayed there and did not go back to San Pablo City up to
his arrest four years later or on May 5, 1984 at Diliman, Quezon City."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's evidence, on the other hand, has been
condensed-by the trial court in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"For his defense, accused Martin Alvero, Jr. presented no
other evidence except his testimony, that:  he is 24 years of age, married and jobless; he does not know the
accusation against him, as well as his co-accused Ruben de las Alas; in the evening
of January 20, 1980, he was at home in San Pablo City; on January 21, 1980, in
the evening, while he was at home, a policeman whose name he does not remember,
came and invited him to go to the San Pablo City Police Station for
questioning; he was told that he was involved in the killing of the victim
Victor Alvaran at the Sampaloc Lake, San Pablo City; at said Station, when he
was interrogated, he answered he did not know the assailants of the said
victim; the following morning, he was allowed to go home; after staying at home
for more than a week, his Aunt Margie Ocho, came and when she left, he went
with her to Manila and stayed at Coguio Village, Antipolo, Rizal; he was given
a job as photographer of (sic) Dom's Portrait, owned by Domingo Cabuyo, and
located at No. 148 Makati Avenue, Makati, Metro Manila, where he stayed for
more than one year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused further testified that:  he went back to his said Aunt Margie Ocho, sister of his mother Norma;
he worked in Marikina, RizaI, for 3 months as helper (sic) in the Camarines
Machine Shop, located at a street he does not remember; then he went back to
his Aunt at Coguio Village, and got married in 1982 in Marikina; from January
21, 1980 up to his arrest on May 5, 1984, he did not receive any notice from the
Court; he does not know Ruel Atienza, and Atienza's declaration that on January
22, 1980, he (Alvero) and De las Alas, were in a  tricycle from Brgy. San Gabriel to San Pablo City proper,
carrying with them some parts of a motorcycle, is not true; he did not ask
Renato Ortega to hide for them the motorcycle parts; when asked of Ortega's
statement that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> sa</span>id Ortega had
known him one month before the incident in question, he answered ‘maybe not
he’; of Pfc. Cordero's testimony that at 10:00 P.M. of (sic) Jan. 20, 1980, he
met said accused inside the comfort room of the Seven Lakes Disco Club and he
(accused) was then wearing a blue jacket with red stripes, accused answered he
does not know; he was arrested at Don Carlos St., Don Antonio Subdivision,
Diliman, Quezon City, where he was working, by a police officer, who informed
him that he has a homicide case in San <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Pablo
</span>City; he does not know the present case.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As disclosed by the prosecution's evidence, no eyewitness to both
the robbery and the killing was presented.  The trial court thus convicted the appellant on the basis of
circumstantial evidence.  It made the
following exposition:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x accused Martin Alvero failed to explain, among others,
some incriminating, albeit, decisive circumstantial evidence, to  wit:  (1) the blue jacket with red stripes that said accused was seen wearing
inside the Seven Lakes Disco Club, which was found near the body of the victim
at the scene of the crime; and (2), the motorcycle part engine block assembly,
seen in his possession, and which he was carrying in a sack, but which he left
at the corner of Alvarez St. and Sgt. de Roma Street, after Renato Ortega
refused to keep it for him.  The blue
jacket with red stripes cannot but place the accused, by inference, at the scene
of the crime about the time a man was heard shouting for help from the said
place.  And the motorcycle engine block
assembly, (Exh. E) which bears Motor No. TS-1252-159446 identifies the
motorcycle from which it was dismantled, as the very Susuki  Motorcycle covered by Registration
Certificate, (Exh. D) and with Motor No. TS-1252-159446, the victim was riding
before his death, (Exh. C); it also points to the accused Alvero as the man who
sped away on a Susuki-type motorcycle from the scene of the felony before
Nestor Comia was able to come near him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The aforementioned unexplained incriminating circumstantial
evidence points to the herein accused and unmasked him as the perpetrator of
the offense charged, the homicide was done in furtherance of the robbery, or by
reason thereof (Peo. vs. Gongora, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">8 </span>SCRA
472).  Needless to state that accused
Alvero having been found in possession of the motorcycle engine block assembly,
(Exh. E) dismantled from the Susuki type motorcycle, subject of the robbery,
(Exh. D), is presumed to be the robber.  And said accused was not able to overcome the said presumption.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Court is also convinced that the series of facts and
circumstances that have been proved, as demonstrated hereinabove, are
consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is
guilty, and at the same time, inconsistent with any other hypothesis except
that of guilt, (Peo. vs. Constante, 12 SCRA 653).  To the mind of the Court, the combination of all the said facts
and circumstances is such as to produce a Conviction beyond reasonable doubt,
(Peo. vs. Modesto, 25 SCRA 36).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The circumstances of flight above-mentioned on the part of the said
accused who after he was held by the police on January 21, 1980, for
questioning, anent the killing of Victor Alvaran, and released the following
day, left San Pablo City, went in hiding in Metro Manila and never returned to
San Pablo City up to his arrest more than four (4) years later, or May 5, 1984,
lend much support to the above findings of the Court, for flight is an evidence
of guilt, (Peo. vs. Carillo, L­-30281, August 2, 1978); it is a circumstance
tending to establish also the guilt of the accused, (Ibid)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

The entire records of the case were then forwarded to this Court.  However, the stenographic notes of the 8
August 1984 testimony of prosecution witness Ruel Atienza were not transcribed
by stenographer Antonio Gesmundo.  Though he was required to do so, Gesmundo still failed to submit the
transcripts.  In the face of such
obstinacy, this Court, in the Resolution of 12 October 1987, ordered Gesmundo's
arrest and detention until he shall have transcribed the said notes and
submitted the same to this Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> The
latter was thus arrested, but later on released by jail authorities before he
could comply with the directive.  A subsequent
order issued by this Court for his re-arrest proved futile.  Left with no other alternatives, we ordered
the retaking of Ruel Atienza's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Discussing both errors jointly, the appellant maintains that the
prosecution's evidence was not sufficient to prove his guilt beyond a
reasonable doubt.  For one, he avers that
the blue jacket with red stripes which he was purportedly seen wearing in the
disco club on the night of the robbery, and which was supposedly found in the
crime scene the following day, was never presented in court or during the
preliminary investigation.  Not <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">even a police blotter entry
concerning the controversial jacket was offered.  This being the case, he could not be positively linked to the
commission of the crime.  Appellant further
claims that it is highly inconceivable that he would intentionally leave his
jacket at the scene of the crime.  For
another, the testimonies of Ruel Tasico and Renato Ortega are replete with
inconsistencies and improbabilities, making them unreliable.  If Ortega had been acquainted with the
appellant for only a month prior to the incident, it would not have been
consistent with the natural scheme of things and human nature for the latter to
have entrusted to the former the safekeeping of the motorcycle parts.  Considering that</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the appellant was seen with his
co-accused Ruben de las Alas and "Isting Doe," it is quite possible
that the former was merely identified by association as one of the
perpetrators.  Lastly, it is claimed
that Tasico did not include the engine block in his inventory of the motorcycle
parts inside the sack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The chief issue posed in this appeal is whether the appellant's
conviction on the basis of circumstantial evidence is correct.  After a careful review of the records, we
rule in the affirmative and sustain the conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order that circumstantial evidence may be sufficient to
convict, the same must comply with these essential requisites, <i>viz.</i>:  (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b)
the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the
combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond
reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> The
circumstantial <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">evidence must
constitute an unbroken chain of events so as to lead to a fair and reasonable
conclusion that points to the guilt of the accused.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In this case, six circumstances were duly considered by the trial
court in arriving at its judgment of conviction, to wit:  (1) moments before the incident on 20
January 1980, the appellant, who was then wearing a blue jacket with red
stripes, was seen by Pat. Cordero inside the comfort room of a disco club; (2)
that same evening, when Nestor Comia came down from his residence to
investigate the source of cries for help, he chanced upon a man nearby speeding
away on a motorcycle; Comia also found a lever which had apparently fallen from
the said motorcycle; (3) <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the
following morning (21 January 1980), the jacket which the appellant was seen
wearing was found near the corpse of Victor Alvaran and subsequently identified
by Cordero at the police station where it was brought; (4) on 22 January 1980,
the appellant was seen by two San Pablo residents, tricycle driver Atienza and
truck driver Ortega, in the company of the other accused; the appellant was
carrying a sack containing motorcycle parts and was looking for someone  with whom he could leave the same for
safekeeping; (5) a few hours later, Pfc. Ruel Tasico discovered a sack
containing motorcycle parts, one of which was the engine block assembly bearing
the same number as the engine block assembly of Victor Alvaran's missing
motorcycle; and (6) the flight of the appellant which was not sufficiently
explained.  There is no reason for us to
disagree with the trial court on these matters.  Such findings are fully supported by the evidence and constitute
an unbroken chain of events which, by their concordant combination and
cumulative effect, more than satisfy the requirements for the conviction of the
appellant.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the blue jacket with red stripes was not
presented in court and no police blotter entry as to it was submitted in
evidence, it does not necessarily follow that Pfc. Cordero did not see the
appellant wearing the said jacket in the evening of 20 January 1980 or see the
same after it was brought to the police station.  As a matter of fact, when Cordero testified on 18 July 1984, the
prosecuting fiscal manifested his intention to subsequently present the
controversial jacket, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL JAVIER</blockquote>

<blockquote>If your honor please,
we will make a reservation on the presentation of the jacket because it is
still in the custody of the property custodian."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It would seem, however, that the
prosecution forgot about such a reservation.  In any event, the following testimony of Pfc. Cordero deserves full
faith and credit:</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Pfc. Cordero could not have been mistaken in his
identification of the appellant because they had been neighbors for a long
time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that the appellant has not questioned Pfc.
Cordero's motive in testifying against him.  It is settled that in the absence of evidence to show why a prosecution
witness would have testified falsely, the logical conclusion is that no such improper
motive existed and that therefore, the testimony is worthy of full faith and
credit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, if an accused had really nothing to do with the crime, it is against
the natural order of events and of human nature and against the presumption of
good faith that a prosecution witness would falsely testify against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Surely, such a misdeed against the appellant could hardly be expected from a
peace officer such as Pfc. Cordero, unless of course the latter was so moved by
an ulterior motive which, even then, should have been convincingly proven at
the outset.  As already pointed out,
however, the appellant made no attempt to prove any motive whatsoever.</p>

afraid was the appellant to return to San Pablo City that he did not even visit
his family during Christmas -- another occasion to hold festive family
reunions.  Furthermore, he even forged

employment or any evidence that may have proven the nature and duration of his
employment.  The rule in this
