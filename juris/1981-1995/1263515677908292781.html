				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This petition for <i>certiorari</i> prays for the reversal of the
decision of the Court of Appeals dated October 29, 1991 in CA-G.R. CV No. 24646
which affirmed the order of the Regional Trial Court dismissing Civil Case No.
Q-89-1751, and its resolution dated November 17, 1991 denying herein
petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class=BODY>The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class=BODY>On December 7, 1988, an altercation between Benigno Torzuela and
Atty. Napoleon Dulay occurred at the &quot;Big Bang Sa Alabang,&quot; Alabang
Village, Muntinlupa as a result of which Benigno Torzuela, the security guard
on duty at the said carnival, shot and killed Atty. Napoleon Dulay.</p>

<p class=BODY>Herein petitioner Maria Benita A. Dulay, widow of the deceased
Napoleon Dulay, in her own behalf and in behalf of her minor children, filed on
February 8, 1989 an action for damages against Benigno Torzuela and herein
private respondents Safeguard Investigation and Security Co., Inc.,
(&quot;SAFEGUARD&quot;) and/or Superguard Security Corp. (&quot;SUPERGUARD&quot;),
alleged employers of defendant Torzuela.  The complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. Q-89-1751 among others alleges
the following:</p>

<blockquote>1. xxx<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>xxx<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>xxx<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Defendants SAFEGUARD INVESTIGATION AND SECURITY CO., INC,
(Defendant Safeguard) and SUPERGUARD SECURITY CORPORATION (Defendant
Superguard) are corporations duly organized and existing in accordance with
Philippine laws, with offices at 10th Floor, Manufacturers Building, Inc.,
Plaza Santa Cruz, Manila.  They are
impleaded as alternative defendants for, while the former appears to be the
employer of defendant BENIGNO TORZUELA (defendant TORZUELA), the latter
impliedly acknowledged, responsibility for the acts of defendant TORZUELA by
extending its sympathies to plaintiffs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;Defendant BENIGNO TORZUELA is of legal age, an employee of
defendant SAFEGUARD and/or defendant SUPERGUARD and, at the time of the
incident complained of, was under their control and supervision. xxx  xxx  xxx  xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3. On December 7,
1988 at around 8:00 a.m., defendant TORZUELA, while he was on duty as security
guard at the 'Big Bang sa Alabang,' Alabang Village, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila
shot and killed NAPOLEON V. DULAY with a .38 caliber revolver belonging to
defendant SAFEGUARD, and/or SUPERGUARD (per Police Report dated January 7,
1989, copy attached as Annex A);</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. The incident
resulting in the death of NAPOLEON V. DULAY was due to the concurring
negligence of the defendants.  Defendant
TORZUELA'S wanton and reckless discharge of the firearm issued to him by
defendant SAFEGUARD and/or SUPERGUARD was the immediate and proximate cause of
the injury, while the negligence of defendant SAFEGUARD and/or SUPERGUARD
consists in its  having failed to
exercise the diligence of a good father of a family in the supervision and
control of its employee to avoid the injury.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style='mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>(Rollo, pp. 117-118)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners prayed for actual, compensatory, moral and exemplary
damages, and attorney's fees.  The said
Civil Case No. Q-89-1751 was raffled to Branch 84 of the Regional Trial Court
of Quezon City, presided by respondent Judge Teodoro Regino.</p>

<p class=BODY>On March 2, 1989, private respondent SUPERGUARD filed a Motion to
Dismiss on the ground that the complaint does not state a valid cause of
action.  SUPERGUARD claimed that
Torzuela's act of shooting Dulay was beyond the scope of his duties, and that
since the alleged act of shooting was committed with deliberate intent (dolo),
the civil liability therefor is governed by Article 100 of the Revised Penal
Code, which states:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Article 100.
Civil liability of a person guilty of a felony. - Every person criminally
liable for a felony is also civilly liable.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>Respondent SUPERGUARD further alleged
that a complaint for damages based on negligence under Article 2176 of the New
Civil Code, such as the one filed by petitioners, cannot lie, since the civil
liability under Article 2176 applies only to quasi-offenses under Article 365
of the Revised Penal Code.  In addition,
the private respondent argued that petitioners' filing of the complaint is
premature  considering that the conviction
of Torzuela in a criminal case is a condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u>
for the employer's subsidiary liability (Rollo, p. 55- 59).</p>

<p class=BODY>Respondent SAFEGUARD also filed a motion praying that it be
excluded as defendant on the ground that defendant Torzuela is not one of its
employees (Rollo, p.96).</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners opposed both motions, stating that their cause of
action against the private respondents is based on their liability under
Article 2180 of the New Civil Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Article 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is
demandable not only for one's own acts or omissions, but also for those of
persons for whom one is responsible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx  xxx  xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Employers</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>liable</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u>
<u>damages</u> <u>caused</u> <u>by</u> <u>their</u> <u>employees</u> <u>and</u>
<u>household</u> <u>helpers</u> <u>acting</u> <u>within</u> <u>the</u> <u>scope</u>
<u>of</u> <u>their</u> <u>assigned</u> <u>tasks</u>, <u>even</u> <u>though</u> <u>the</u>
<u>former</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>engaged</u> <u>in</u> <u>any</u> <u>business</u>
<u>or</u> <u>industry</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx  xxx  xxx&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners contended that a suit against alternative defendants
is allowed under Rule 3, Section 13 of the Rules of Court.  Therefore, the inclusion of private
respondents as alternative defendants in the complaint is justified by the
following: the Initial Investigation Report prepared by Pat. Mario Tubon
showing that Torzuela is an employee of SAFEGUARD; and through overt acts,
SUPERGUARD extended its sympathies to petitioners  (Rollo, pp. 64 and 98).</p>

<p class=BODY>Meanwhile, an Information dated March 21, 1989 charging Benigno
Torzuela with homicide was filed before the Regional Trial Court of Makati and
was docketed as Criminal Case No. 89-1896.</p>

<p class=BODY>On April 13, 1989, respondent Judge Regino issued an order
granting SUPERGUARD'S motion to dismiss and SAFEGUARD'S motion for exclusion as
defendant.  The respondent judge held
that the complaint did not state facts necessary or sufficient to constitute a
quasi-delict since it does not mention any negligence on the part of Torzuela
in shooting Napoleon Dulay or that the same was done in the performance of his
duties.  Respondent judge ruled that
mere allegations of the concurring negligence of the defendants (private
respondents herein) without stating the facts showing such negligence are mere
conclusions of law (Rollo, p. 106).  Respondent judge also declared that the complaint was one for damages
founded on crimes punishable under Articles 100 and 103 of the Revised Penal
Code as distinguished from those arising from quasi-delict.  The dispositive portion of the order dated
April 13, 1989 states:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHEREFORE, this Court holds that in view of the material and
ultimate facts alleged in the verified complaint and <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>in </span>accordance with the applicable law on the matter as well as
precedents laid down by the Supreme Court, the complaint against the
alternative defendants Superguard Security Corporation and Safeguard
Investigation and Security Co., Inc., must be and (sic) it is hereby
dismissed.&quot; (Rollo, p. 110)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The above order was affirmed by the respondent court and
petitioners' motion for reconsideration thereof was denied.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners take exception to the assailed decision and insist
that quasi-delicts are not limited to acts of negligence but also cover acts
that are intentional and voluntary, citing Andamo v. IAC (191 SCRA 195
[1990]).  Thus, petitioners insist that
Torzuela's act of shooting Napoleon Dulay constitutes a quasi-delict actionable
under Article 2176 of the New Civil Code.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners further contend that under Article 2180 of the New
Civil Code, private respondents are primarily liable for their negligence
either in the selection or supervision of their employees.  This liability is independent of the
employee's own liability for fault or negligence and is distinct from the
subsidiary civil liability under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code.  The civil action against the employer may
therefore proceed independently of the criminal action pursuant to Rule 111
Section 3 of the Rules of Court.  Petitioners submit that the question of whether Torzuela is an employee
of respondent SUPERGUARD or SAFEGUARD would be better resolved after trial.</p>

<p class=BODY>Moreover, petitioners argue that Torzuela's act of shooting Dulay
is also actionable under Article 33 of the New Civil Code, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Article 33.  In cases
of defamation, fraud, and physical injuries, <u>a</u> <u>civil</u> <u>action</u>
<u>for</u> <u>damages</u>, <u>entirely</u> <u>separate</u> <u>and</u> <u>distinct</u>
<u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>criminal</u> <u>action</u>, <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>brought</u>
<u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>injured</u> <u>party</u>.  Such civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal
prosecution, and shall require only a preponderance of evidence.&quot;
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In the same vein, petitioners cite Section 3, Rule 111 of the
Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Rule 111.  xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 3.  When civil
action may proceed independently - In the cases provided for in Articles 32,
33, 34 and 2176 of the Civil Code of the Philippines, <u>the</u> <u>independent</u>
<u>civil</u> <u>action</u> <u>which</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>reserved</u> <u>may</u>
<u>be</u> <u>brought</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>offended</u> <u>party</u>, <u>shall</u>
<u>proceed</u> <u>independently</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>criminal</u> <u>action</u>,
<u>and</u> <u>shall</u> <u>require</u> <u>only</u> <u>a</u> <u>preponderance</u>
<u>of</u> <u>evidence</u>.&quot; (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The term &quot;physical injuries&quot; under Article 33 has been
held to include consummated, frustrated and attempted homicide.  Thus, petitioners maintain that Torzuela's
prior conviction is unnecessary since the civil action can proceed
independently of the criminal action.  On the other hand, it is the private respondents' argument that since
the act was not committed with negligence, the petitioners have no cause of
action under Articles 2176 and 2177 of the New Civil Code.  The civil action contemplated in Article
2177 is not applicable to acts committed with deliberate intent, but only applies
to quasi-offenses under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code.  Torzuela's act of shooting Atty. Dulay to
death, aside from being purely personal, was done with deliberate intent and
could not have been part of his duties as security guard.  And since Article 2180 of the New Civil Code
covers only acts done within the scope of the employee's assigned tasks, the
private respondents cannot be held liable for damages.</p>

<p class=BODY>We find for petitioners.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is undisputed that Benigno Torzuela is being prosecuted for
homicide for the fatal shooting of Napoleon Dulay.  Rule 111 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure provides:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 1. Institution of criminal and civil actions.  When a criminal action is<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'> </span>instituted, the civil action for the
recovery of civil liability is impliedly instituted with the criminal action, <u><span

style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> <u>criminal</u>  <u>action</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Such civil action includes recovery of indemnity under the Revised Penal
Code, and damages under Articles 32, 33, 34, and 2176 of the Civil Code of the
Philippines arising from the same act or omission of the accused.&quot;
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>It is well-settled that the filing of an independent civil action
before the prosecution in the criminal action presents evidence is even far
better than a compliance with the requirement of an express reservation (Yakult
Philippines v. Court of Appeals 190 SCRA 357 [1990]).  This is precisely what the petitioners opted to do in this case.  However, the private respondents opposed the
civil action on the ground that the same is founded on a delict and not on a
quasi-delict as the shooting was not attended by negligence.  What is in dispute therefore is the nature
of the petitioner's cause of action.</p>

<p class=BODY>The nature of a cause of action is determined by the facts
alleged in the complaint as constituting the cause of action (Republic v.
Estenzo, 158 SCRA 282 [1988]).  The
purpose of an action or suit and the law to govern it is to be determined not
by the claim of the party filing the action, made in his argument or brief, but
rather by the complaint itself, its allegations and prayer for relief.  (De Tavera v. Philippine Tuberculosis
Society, 112 SCRA 243 [1982]).  An
examination of the complaint in the present case would show that the
plaintiffs, petitioners herein, are invoking their right to recover damages
against the private respondents for their vicarious responsibility for the
injury caused by Benigno Torzuela's act of shooting and killing Napoleon Dulay,
as stated in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the complaint.</p>

<p class=BODY>Article 2176 of the New Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Art. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage to
another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay for the damage
done.  Such fault or negligence, if
there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties is called a
quasi-delict and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Contrary to the theory of private respondents, there is no
justification for limiting the scope of Article 2176 of the Civil Code to acts
or omissions resulting from negligence.  Well-entrenched is the doctrine that Article 2176 covers not only acts
committed with negligence, but also acts which are voluntary and
intentional.  As far back as the definitive
case of Elcano v. Hill (77 SCRA 98 [1977]), this Court already held that:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;xxx <u>Article</u> <u>2176</u>, <u>where</u> <u>it</u> <u>refers</u>
<u>to</u> <u>'fault</u> <u>or</u> <u>negligence</u>,' <u>covers</u> <u>not</u> <u>only</u>
<u>acts</u> <u>'not</u> <u>punishable</u> <u>by</u> <u>law'</u> <u>but</u> <u>also</u>
<u>acts</u> <u>criminal</u> <u>in</u> <u>character</u>, <u>whether</u> <u>intentional</u>
<u>and</u> <u>voluntary</u> <u>or</u> <u>negligent</u>.  <u>Consequently</u>, <u>a</u> <u>separate</u>
<u>civil</u> <u>action</u> <u>lies</u> <u>against</u> <u>the</u> <u>offender</u>
<u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>criminal</u> <u>act</u>, <u>whether</u> <u>or</u> <u>not</u>
<u>he</u> <u>is</u> <u>criminally</u> <u>prosecuted</u> <u>and</u> <u>found</u>
<u>guilty</u> <u>or</u> <u>acquitted</u>, <u>provided</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u>
<u>offended</u> <u>party</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>allowed</u>, <u>if</u> <u>he</u>
<u>is</u> <u>actually</u> <u>charged</u> <u>also</u> <u>criminally</u>, <u>to</u>
<u>recover</u> <u>damages</u> <u>on</u> <u>both</u> <u>scores</u>, and would be
entitled in such eventuality only to the bigger award of the two, assuming the
awards made in the two cases vary.  In
other words, the extinction of civil liability referred to in Par. (e) of
Section 3, Rule 111, refers exclusively to civil liability founded on Article
100 of the Revised Penal Code, whereas the civil liability for the same act
considered as quasi-delict only and not as a crime is not extinguished even by
a declaration in the criminal case that the criminal act charged has not
happened or has not been committed by the accused.  Briefly stated, We here hold, in reiteration of Garcia, that <u>culpa</u>
<u>aquiliana</u> <u>includes</u> <u>voluntary</u> <u>and</u> <u>negligent</u> <u>acts</u>
<u>which</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>punishable</u> <u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>by</span></u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> </span><u>law.</u>&quot;
(Emphasis supplied)<b><span style='font-size:6.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The same doctrine was echoed in the case of Andamo v.
Intermediate Appellate Court (191 SCRA 195 [1990]), wherein the Court held:</p>

<blockquote><u>&quot;Article</u> <u>2176,</u> <u>whenever</u> <u>it</u> <u>refers</u>
<u>to</u> <u>'fault</u> <u>or</u> <u>negligence</u>,' <u>covers</u> <u>not</u> <u>only</u>
<u>acts</u> <u>'not</u> <u>punishable</u> <u>by</u> <u>law'</u> <u>but</u> <u>also</u>
<u>acts</u> <u>criminal</u> <u>in</u> <u>character,</u> <u>whether</u> <u>intentional</u>
<u>and</u> <u>voluntary</u> <u>or</u> <u>negligent</u>.  Consequently, a civil action lies against
the offender in a criminal act, whether or not he is prosecuted or found guilty
or acquitted, provided that the offended party is not allowed, (if the
tortfeasor is actually also charged criminally), to recover damages on both
scores, and would be entitled in such eventuality only to the bigger award of
the two, assuming the awards made in the two cases vary.&quot; [citing Virata v.
Ochoa, 81 SCRA 472] (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Private respondents submit that the word &quot;intentional&quot;
in the <u>Andamo</u> case is inaccurate obiter, and should be read as
&quot;voluntary&quot; since intent cannot be coupled with negligence as defined
by Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code.  In the absence of more substantial reasons, this Court will not disturb
the above doctrine on the coverage of Article 2176.</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondents further aver that Article 33 of the New Civil
Code applies only to injuries intentionally committed pursuant to the ruling in
Marcia v. CA (120 SCRA 193 [1983]), and that the actions for damages allowed
thereunder are ex-delicto.  However, the
term &quot;physical injuries&quot; in Article 33 has already been construed to
include bodily injuries causing death (Capuno v. Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of the
Philippines 121 Phil 638 [1965]; Carandang v. Santiago 97 Phil. 94
[1955]).  It is not the crime of
physical injuries defined in the Revised Penal Code.  It includes not only physical injuries but also consummated,
frustrated, and attempted homicide (Madeja v. Caro 126 SCRA 293 [1983]).  Although in the <u>Marcia</u> case (<u>supra</u>),
it was held that no independent civil action may be filed under Article 33
where the crime is the result of criminal negligence, it must be noted however,
that Torzuela, the accused in the case at bar, is charged with homicide, not
with reckless imprudence, whereas the defendant in <u>Marcia</u> was charged
with reckless imprudence.  Therefore,
in this case, a civil action based on Article 33 lies.</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondents also contend that their liability is
subsidiary under the Revised Penal Code; and that they are not liable for
Torzuela's act which is beyond the scope of his duties as a security
guard.  It having been established that
the instant action is not ex-delicto, petitioners may proceed directly against
Torzuela and the private respondents.  Under Article 2180 of the New Civil Code as aforequoted, when an injury
is caused by the negligence of the employee, there instantly arises a
presumption of law that there was negligence on the part of the master or
employer either in the selection of the servant or employee, or in supervision
over him after selection or both (Layugan v. Intermediate Appellate Court 167
SCRA 363 [1988]).  The liability of the
employer under Article 2180 is direct and immediate; it is not conditioned upon
prior recourse against the negligent employee and a prior showing of the
insolvency of such employee (Kapalaran Bus Lines v. Coronado 176 SCRA 792 [1989]).  Therefore, it is incumbent upon the private
respondents to prove that they exercised the diligence of a good father of a
family in the selection and supervision of their employee.</p>

<p class=BODY>Since Article 2176 covers not only acts of negligence but also
acts which are intentional and voluntary, it was therefore erroneous on the
part of the trial court to dismiss petitioner's complaint simply because it
failed to make allegations of attendant negligence attributable to private
respondents.</p>

<p class=BODY>With respect to the issue of whether the complaint at hand states
a sufficient cause of action, the general rule is that the allegations in a
complaint are sufficient to constitute a cause of action against the defendants
if, admitting the facts alleged, the court can render a valid judgment upon the
same in accordance with the prayer therein.  A cause of action exists if the following elements are present, namely:
(1) a right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law
it arises or is created; (2) an obligation on the part of the named defendant
to respect or not to violate such right; and (3) an act or omission on the part
of such defendant violative of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a
breach of the obligation of the defendant to the plaintiff for which the latter
may maintain an action for recovery of damages (Del Bros Hotel Corporation v.
CA, 210 SCRA 33 [1992]); Development Bank of the Philippines v. Pundogar 218
SCRA 118 [1993]).</p>

<p class=BODY>This Court finds, under the foregoing premises, that the complaint
sufficiently alleged an actionable breach on the part of the defendant Torzuela
and respondents SUPERGUARD and/or SAFEGUARD.  It is enough that the complaint alleged that Benigno Torzuela shot
Napoleon Dulay resulting in the latter's death; that the shooting occurred
while Torzuela was on duty; and that either SUPERGUARD and/or SAFEGUARD was
Torzuela's employer and responsible for his acts.  This does not operate however, to establish that the defendants
below are liable.  Whether or not the
shooting was actually reckless and wanton or attended by negligence and whether
it was actually done within the scope of Torzuela's duties; whether the private
respondents SUPERGUARD and/or SAFEGUARD failed to exercise the diligence of a
good father of a family; and whether the defendants are actually liable, are
questions which can be better resolved after trial on the merits where each
party can present evidence to prove their respective allegations and defenses.</p>

<p class=BODY>In determining whether the allegations of a complaint are
sufficient to support a cause of action, it must be borne in mind that the
complaint does not have to establish or allege the facts proving the existence
of a cause of action at the outset; this will have to be done at the trial on
the merits of the case (Del Bros Hotel Corporation v. CA, <u>supra</u>).  If the allegations in a complaint can
furnish a sufficient basis by which the complaint can be maintained, the same
should not be dismissed regardless of the defenses that may be assessed by the
defendants (Rava Dev't. Corp. v. CA 211 SCRA 152 [1992] citing Consolidated
Bank &amp; Trust Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 197 SCRA 663 [1991]).  To sustain a motion to dismiss for lack of
cause of action, the complaint must show that the claim for relief does not
exist rather than that a claim has been defectively stated or is ambiguous,
indefinite or uncertain (Azur v. Provincial Board 27 SCRA 50 [1969]).  Since the petitioners clearly sustained an
injury to their rights under the law, it would be more just to allow them to
present evidence of such injury.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the petition for review is
hereby GRANTED.  The decision of the
Court of Appeals as well as the Order of the Regional Trial Court dated April 13,
