				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Cecilia U. Ledesma prays before this Court for the
reversal of the Decision of the respondent Court of Appeals of August 30, 1990<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
ordering the dismissal of her ejectment complaint before the Manila
Metropolitan Trial Court for lack of cause of action due to non-compliance with
Sections 6 and 9 of P.D. 1508 (Katarungang Pambarangay Law) as well as the
Resolution of January 7, 1991<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of said Decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case as summarized by the petitioner in her
Memorandum are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner is the owner-lessor of an apartment building
located at 800-802 Remedios Street, Malate, Manila.  Two (2) units of said apartment building were leased (now being
unlawfully occupied) to private respondent at monthly rates of P3,450.00 for
the unit/apartment located at 800 Remedios Street, Malate, Manila and P2,300.00
for the unit/apartment located at 802 Remedios Street, Malate, Manila,
respectively, x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Said lease was originally covered by written contracts of
lease both dated December 10, 1984 and except for the rates and duration, the
terms and conditions of said contracts were impliedly renewed on a
‘month-to-month’ basis pursuant to Article 1670 of the Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One of the terms and conditions of the said Contract of
Lease, that of monthly rental payments, was violated by private respondent and
that as of October 31, 1988, said private respondent has incurred arrears for
both units in the total sum of P14,039.00 for which letters of demand were sent
to, and received by, private respondent.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon failure of private respondent to honor the demand
letters, petitioner referred the matter to the Barangay for conciliation which
eventually issued a certification to file action.  Petitioner was assisted by her son, Raymond U. Ledesma, (who is
not a lawyer) during the barangay proceeding as she was suffering from
recurring psychological and emotional ailment as can be seen from the receipts
and prescriptions issued by her psychiatrist copies of which are attached as
Annexes 'E-E10' of the said Petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Due to the stubborn refusal of the private respondent to
vacate the premises petitioner was constrained to retain the services of
counsel to initiate this ejectment proceeding."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch 10, Manila, rendered a
decision on June 21, 1989 ordering private respondent to vacate the premises,
to pay rentals falling due after May 1989 and to pay attorney's fees in the
amount of P2,500.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> The
Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch IX, on appeal, affirmed the MTC ruling
except for the award of attorney's fees which it reduced to P1,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent, however, found favor with the respondent
Court of Appeals when he elevated the case in a Petition for Review, when it
ruled, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“IN VIEW WHEREOF, the Decision dated October 13, 1989 of the RTC of
Manila, Br. IX in Civil Case No. 89-49672 is reversed and set aside and the
Complaint for Ejectment against petitioner is dismissed for lack of cause of
action.  No costs.”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this appeal, raising several assignments of error, namely,
that the Court of Appeals erred -</p>

<blockquote>1.  In holding that private respondent raised
the issue of non-compliance with Sections 6 and 9 of P.D. 1508 in the lower
court when in fact and in truth his answer and position paper failed to do so,
contrary to evidence on record;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  In failing to consider that private
respondent had waived his right to question the lack of cause of action of the
complaint, if there is any, contrary to law, established jurisprudence, and
evidence on record;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. In giving undue
weight and credence to the self-serving allegations of the private respondent
that summons was not served him, contrary to law, established jurisprudence and
evidence on record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. In disregarding
the well-known principle of law that barangay authorities are presumed to have
performed their official duties and to have acted regularly in issuing the
certificate to file action and grossly and manifestly erred in making an
opposite conclusion to this effect, contrary to law, established jurisprudence
and evidence on record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  In not holding that the settlement was
repudiated, contrary to law and evidence on record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.  In not affirming the judgment rendered by
the Metropolitan Trial Court and Regional Trial Court below.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner assails private respondent for raising the issue of
non-compliance with Sections 6 and 9 of P.D. 1508 only in his petition for
review with the appellate court and which mislead the court to erroneously
dismiss her complaint for ejectment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 6 of P.D. 1508 states:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 6. Conciliation pre-condition to filing of
complaint.  - No complaint, petition,
action or proceeding involving any matter within the authority of the Lupon as
provided in Section 2 hereof shall be filed or instituted in court or any other
government office for adjudication unless there has been a confrontation of the
parties before the Lupon Chairman or the Pangkat and no conciliation or
settlement has been reached as certified by the Lupon Secretary or the Pangkat
Secretary, attested by the Lupon or Pangkat Chairman, or unless the settlement has
been repudiated.  x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> xxx  xxx"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">while Section 9 states that:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 9.  Appearance of
parties in person.  - In all proceedings
provided for herein, the parties must appear in person without the assistance of
counsel/ representative, with the exception of minors and incompetents who may
be assisted by their next of kin who are not lawyers."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner submits that said issue, not having been raised <span style="">by </span>private respondent in the court
below, cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, specially in the Court of
Appeals, citing <i>Saludes vs. Pajarillo.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent had waived said objection, following the line of reasoning
in <i>Royales vs. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent denies having waived the defenses of
non-compliance with Sections 6 and 9 of P.D. 1508.  His Answer before the Metropolitan Trial Court, specifically
paragraphs 4, 7 &amp; 8, substantially raised the fact of non-compliance by
petitioner with Sections 6 and 9 of P.D. 1508 and consequently, subjected
petitioner's complaint to dismissal for lack of cause of action, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx  xxx  xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. Answering
defendant denies the allegations of paragraph 8, the truth of the matter being
that he was not duly summoned nor subpoenaed by the Barangay Chairman, who
issued the alluded certification, to appear for hearing."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx  xxx  xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7. Plaintiff h<span style="">a</span>s no
cause of action against answering defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8. The
certification to file action (annex D of the complaint) was improperly <span style="">or </span>irregularly issued as the defendant
was never summoned nor subpoenaed by the Barangay Chairman to appear for
hearing <span style="">in </span>connection with the
alleged complaint of the plaintiff.  In
effect the mandatory provision of P.D. 1508 was not complied with warranting
the dismissal of the instant complaint."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx  xxx  xxx.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with petitioner that the issue of non-compliance
with Sections 6 and 9 of P.D. 1508 was raised only for the first time in the
Court of Appeals.  When private
respondent stated that he was never summoned or subpoenaed by the Barangay
Chairman, he, in effect, was stating that since he was never summoned, he could
not appear in person for the needed confrontation of the parties before the
Lupon Chairman for conciliation and/or amicable settlement.  Without the mandatory personal
confrontation, no complaint could be filed with the MTC.  Private respondent's allegation in paragraph
4 of his Answer that he was never summoned or subpoenaed by the Barangay
Chairman; that plaintiff has no cause of action against him as alleged in
paragraph 7 of the Answer; and that the certification to file action was
improperly issued in view of the foregoing allegations thereby resulting in
non-compliance with the mandatory requirements of P.D. No. 1508, as stated in
paragraph 8 of the Answer are in substantial compliance with the raising of
said issues and/or objections in the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner would like to make it appear to this Court that she
appeared before the Lupon Chairman to confront private respondent.  She stated in her Petition<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and her Memorandum<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
that:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon failure of private respondent to honor the demand
letters, petitioner referred the matter to the barangay for conciliation which
eventually issued a certification to file action.  Petitioner was assisted by her son, Raymond U. Ledesma, (who is
not a lawyer) during the barangay proceeding as she was suffering from
recurring psychological and emotional ailment as can be seen from the receipt
and prescriptions issued by her psychiatrist copies of which are attached
herewith as Annexes 'E-E10'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, as found out by the respondent court:</p>

<blockquote>"We agree with the petitioner that private respondent Cecile
Ledesma failed to comply with section 6 of P.D. 1508.  The record of the case is barren showing compliance by the
private respondent.  Indeed, the
documentary evidence of the private respondent herself attached to the
complaint buttresses this conclusion.  They show that it is not the private respondent but her son, Raymund U.
Ledesma, and her lawyer, Atty. Epifania Navarro who dealt with the petitioner
regarding their dispute.  Thus, the
demand letter dated October 18, 1988 sent to the petitioner for payment of
rentals in the sum of P14,039.00 was signed by Raymund Ledesma.  On the other hand, the demand letter dated
November 14, 1988 was signed by Atty. Epifania Navarro.  More telling is the Certification to File
Action signed by Barangay Chairman, Alberto A. Solis where it appears that the
complainant is Raymund U. Ledesma and not the private respondent."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier, Section 9 of P.D. 1508 mandates personal
confrontation <span style="">of </span>the parties
because:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x <span style="">a </span>personal confrontation between the parties without the
intervention of a counsel or representative would generate spontaneity and <span style="">a </span>favorable disposition to amicable
settlement on the part of the disputants.  In other words, the said procedure is deemed conducive to the successful
resolution of the dispute at the barangay level."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner tries to show that her failure to personally appear
before the Barangay Chairman was because of her recurring psychological
ailments.  But for the entire year of
1988<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
-- specifically September to December 6 -- there is no indication at all that
petitioner went to see her psychiatrist for consultation.  The only conclusion is that 1988 was a lucid
interval for petitioner.  There was,
therefore, no excuse then for her non-appearance at the Lupon Chairman's
office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, not having shown that she is incompetent, cannot be
represented by counsel or even by attorney-in-fact who is next of kin.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As explained by the Minister of Justice with whom We agree:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"To ensure compliance with the requirement of personal
confrontation between the parties, and thereby, the effectiveness of the
barangay conciliation proceedings as a mode of dispute resolution, the
above-quoted provision is couched in mandatory language.  Moreover, pursuant to the familiar maxim in
statutory construction dictating that 'expressio unius est  exclusio alterius', the express exceptions
made regarding minors and incompetents must be construed as exclusive of all
others not mentioned."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's non-compliance with Secs. 6 and 9 of P.D. 1508
legally barred her from pursuing the ejectment case in the MTC of Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Having arrived at this conclusion, there is no need for Us to discuss the other
issues involved.</p>
