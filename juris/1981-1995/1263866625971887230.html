remaining portion </span><span style="">to </span>third

<p class="BODY">Sometime in March, 1969 the mentioned building was razed by fire

to compel the defendant to effect the redemption to them of the subject
realties, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>
having died at this time, he was represented by his heirs. <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span>
refused to sell back to the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> the properties
because the latter was tendering only the price of P34<span class="GramE">,026.00</span>

the building he erected and also for the cost of the registration of the
realties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>,
on the other hand, claimed that the transactions between them </span><span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Songcuan</span></span><span style=""> were one of equitable mortgage and, therefore, <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span>
cannot compel them to pay for the cost of the building he had </span>erected <span style="">without their permission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From this </span><span style="">decision </span><span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span>
appealed by <i>certiorari</i> to this Court (G.R. No. 75096).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>principal issue here is the same as that
presented in the lower court and the Court of <span style="">Appeals, which </span>is, whether or not the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>
had forfeited their right to repurchase, or whether the right may be rescinded
under the grounds advanced by <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">After deliberating on the
arguments raised, this Court rules <span style="">in </span>the
negative.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">do not find merit in <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span>
argument that the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> had forfeited their right
to repurchase the subject premises for having failed to exercise it within
thirty days from the finality of the decision in Civil Case No. 2621 citing the
third paragraph of Article 1606 of the Civil Code which provides that a
vendor-a-retro may still exercise his right to repurchase "within thirty
days from the time the final judgment was rendered in a civil action on the
basis that the contract was a true sale with right to repurchase." The
judgment in Civil Case No. 2621 which had become final on March 9, 1981, had
ordained that the running of </span>the <span style="">period
within which the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> could repurchase the
premises had been suspended during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the case and they were given the option either to repurchase the premises
within 30-days from the finality of the judgment, as provided by the law, or
within the remaining period of one year, ten months and 18 days <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
axiomatic that a final judgment may no longer be amended and to limit now to
30-days the period within which the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> may
repurchase the premises would be an open violation of the rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A final judgment is the law between the
parties to a case and controls their relation with </span>respect the <span style="">controversy there presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thus fully agree with the pronouncement of
the appellate court on this matter that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is no merit in <span class="SpellE">Songcuan's</span>
claim that the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>’ failure to abide by Article
1606 of the New Civil Code foreclosed their right to repurchase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, Art. 1606 provides that the
vendors-a-retro may repurchase within 30 days from the finality of the judgment
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it is noted that the final decision
in Case 2621, which became final on March 9, 1981, gave the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>
two alternative periods within which to exercise the right to repurchase-either
within 30 days as prescribed in Article 1606, <u>or</u> within 1 year, 10
months and 18 days from March 9, 1981, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
whichever <span style="">of </span>the alternative

would still constitute a valid exercise of their right." (<i>pp. 64-65, </i><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Rollo</span></i></span><span style="">)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither do <span class="GramE">We</span> agree that the right of
the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> to repurchase may be rescinded under
Article 1191 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> asserts that the October 10, 1966 contract he

obligation between them- for him to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the
subject premises and for the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> to lease the
realties to him- and the refusal of the latter to fulfill their obligation
gives him the right, under Article 1191, <span style="">to
rescind</span> "the right of [the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>] to <span style="">repurchase" the realities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law provides </span>in part:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1191.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power
to rescind obligations is implied in reciprocal ones, in case one of the
obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The cited law is not applicable in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the parties are each obligor and <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> of <span style="">the </span>other,
their corresponding obligation can <span style="">hardly
</span>be called reciprocal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
reciprocal obligations the obligation of one is a <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span>
condition of the obligation of the other, the non-fulfillment of which entitles
the other party to rescind the contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the <span style="">case at bar, there are
two separate and distinct obligations, each independent of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obligation </span>of <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span>

right to repurchase x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span>and becomes the owner and possessor of the premises, they shall
<span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>be obliged to give [<span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span>]
the right of lease and are <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> obliged to execute a
lease contract x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
In other words, the obligation of the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> to
lease to <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> the subject premises arises only
after the latter had <span class="SpellE"><span style="">r</span>econveyed</span>
the realties to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>quote <span style="">with approval the </span>following <span style="">statement of the respondent appellate court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"For the stipulation imposes on them the
obligation to execute the lease only at such time when the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>
or any one among them exercises the right and becomes the possessor of the
properties in question <span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, the obligation to execute
the lease emerges only if the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> had already
repurchased and obtained possession of the repurchased properties." (<i>p.
66, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span></i>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Should the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>
fail to lease the subject premises to <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> after <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, then the latter's remedy is not for
rescission but for specific performance, which in fact he asked for in the
alternative and was granted by the trial court and the <span style="">Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, </span><span style="">the right of the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>
to repurchase must be </span><span style="">upheld </span><span style="">notwithstanding the fact that such right had
not been annotated at the back of <span class="SpellE">Songcuan's</span>
certificate of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of
annotation is only to serve notice to third persons and not to lend validity or
nullity to </span>an instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next question to be resolved is how much area <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> is entitled to lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial <span class="GramE">court,</span>
awarded <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> the whole premises, based on the
"P.S. (Additional Condition)" which speaks of "the premises
actually occupied by [<span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span>]" and there was no
evidence presented by the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> on the area <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> was <span style="">actually
occupying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the trial court said
that the right of <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> to lease the whole
premises is strengthened by the fact that he became the registered owner of the
realties and hence, has complete dominion over the properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We rule, however, that
the P.S. clause refers to the area <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> was
actually occupying and not to what he constructively may </span><span style="">possess as </span><span style="">the owner of the premises at the time of the execution of the </span><st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="10"><span style="">October
 10, </span>1966</st1:date> <span style="">contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, as pointed out by private
respondents, there was no need to present any evidence as to the area <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> was </span>actually occupying since <span style="">at </span>the <span style="">pre</span>-trial conference in the trial
court, <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> had admitted that he <span style="">was </span>occupying only one-third of the
single story <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span> building.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the parties’
agreement, <span class="SpellE">Songcuan's</span> lease was to start from the
time the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> exercised their right to <span class="GramE">repurchase,</span> <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> should
therefore be deemed to </span>have <span style="">become
the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>’ </span>lessee on <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1981</st1:date> and <span style="">should pay </span>rent in the amount agreed upon from said date.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the deletion
by the respondent court of the award to <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> of
attorney's fees, </span><span class="GramE">We</span> fully <span style="">agree and quote its pronouncement that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We find no justification for the exorbitant award in <span class="SpellE">Songcuan's</span> favor of attorney's fees of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> considered as damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attorney's <span style="">fees </span>in concept of damages may be awarded only if the defendant
acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing plaintiff's just and
demandable claim. (Art. 2208, New Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, there is no showing that the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>
acted in bad faith in refusing <span class="SpellE">Songcuan's</span> claim to a
25-year lease of the entire premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The stipulation to that effect merely refers to the premises <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> was occupying at the execution of the deed on <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1966</st1:date>, which admittedly,
was only 1/3 of the ground floor of the <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to G.R. No.
80851, which </span>is <span style="">a petition to
enjoin the implementation of the writ of possession in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span>, there is no need to discuss the issues therein, as
the same has become moot and academic, this Court having pronounced that <span class="SpellE">Songcuan</span> is entitled to lease only one-third of the ground
floor of the subject building, with the <span class="SpellE">Alviars</span> being
entitled to a writ of possession as to the rest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
