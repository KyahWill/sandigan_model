alias “<span class="SpellE">Amin</span>” and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span>, were charged with Multiple Murder in the Regional
Trial Court, Branch 5, of <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, for the murder of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
Domingo, his six-year-old son, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, and his
wife’s cousin, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ganaban</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Diga</span> was sentenced
to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has appealed to this Court to seek a

<p class="BODY">The personal circumstances <span style="">of
</span><span style="">the </span><u>dramatis</u> <u>personae</u>
in these cold blooded murders were summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“In 1969, the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain of Alba
was <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Domingo and the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
secretary was his wife Lucia Domingo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the councilmen was accused <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Domingos</span> were staunch political supporters of the then
incumbent Municipal Mayor <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pallagao</span> while <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span> was Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Herrero’s</span> political leader in Alba.” <span class="GramE">(p.

<blockquote>“<span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span>
was a farmer who is a native and used to reside in <span class="SpellE">Tallang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Baggao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
1967, Mrs. Juanita <span class="SpellE">Herrero</span> invited him and his family
to live with her in her house in <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Baggao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> agreed and so he and his family lived with Mrs.
Juanita <span class="SpellE">Herrero</span> in <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city>
from 1967 to 1970. </blockquote>

the rice threshing business and recorder in the tobacco trading of <span class="SpellE">Gogo</span> <span class="SpellE">Herrero</span>, a son of Mrs.
Juanita <span class="SpellE">Herrero</span> and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Tungel</span>,

each other, with intent to kill, with evident premeditation and with treachery,
did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and
feloniously assault, attack and shoot <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Domingo,
<span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> Domingo and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Gannaban</span>,
inflicting upon them several wounds on their bodies, which wounds caused their
death.” p. 3, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When the two accused were arraigned on <st1:date month="10" day="22" year="1969">October 22, 1969</st1:date>, they pleaded not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trial on the merits commenced on <st1:date month="12" day="9" year="1969">December 9, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the prosecution had finished the

stopped coming to the hearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife
appeared later and informed the court that her husband had been abducted on <st1:date month="2" day="16" year="1978">February 16, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On motion of the prosecution, the court
ordered a separate trial for <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The murders, which are the subject of this criminal case,
occurred in the late afternoon of <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1969">August
 22, 1969</st1:date> in the remote <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> of Alba, <span class="SpellE">Baggao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, which is
bisected from east to west by the 25-meter-wide-Paranan River.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public elementary school in Alba, which
was located on the north side of the road which runs parallel to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Paranan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
was undergoing repairs and renovation, a communal task of the barrio folks led
by the barrio captain, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Domingo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following factual findings of the trial court are reproduced
hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>“On <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1969">August 22, 1969</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> was informed that sand and gravel were needed
in the work in the school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At past <st1:time hour="13" minute="0">1:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of that day, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> instructed Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Gannaban</span>
to call for the brothers <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> and Jose Medrano
to help them in the hauling of sand and gravel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rodolfo complied and in short while he came back with the two brothers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“About 2:00 o’clock that same afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
and his son, the <span style="">6-year old <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, Rodolfo and the Medrano brothers boarded the
weapon’s carrier of and driven by <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> and
proceeded to the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went <span class="SpellE">downgrgade</span> through that ascending road then turned westward
until they reached the gravel pit some 60 to 100 meters away.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“The men went about their
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After sometime, they were able to
make two deliveries of sand and gravel to the school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they returned to the pit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the men had loaded the weapon’s carrier
with sand and gravel, they readied themselves for the third delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must have already been between </span><st1:time hour="16" minute="30"><span style="">4:30</span></st1:time><span style=""> and </span><st1:time hour="17" minute="0"><span style="">5:00 o’clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They boarded the vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who sat in the front seat were <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> who was at the wheel, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>
who sat at the right side of his father and Rodolfo who was at the extreme
right beside <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> stayed at
the back of the carrier on the left side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Left behind in the pit to continue piling sand and gravel for the
succeeding deliveries was Jose Medrano.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“Then the vehicle reached
the ascending road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it was moving
upgrade and northward and was about to reach the level of the river bank, a
sudden burst of automatic </span>gunfire <span style="">from
the left or western side of the ascending road rent the air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
instinctively turned his face toward the west and saw <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Diga</span> standing and holding </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">long gun while </span><span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Piga</span></span><span style=""> stood beside him at the western side of the
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
was hit but he </span>still <span style="">managed </span>to
<span style="">blurt out ‘we are </span>in<span style=""> trouble!’<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“The weapon carrier’s
engine conked out and the vehicle violently rolled back downward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> Medrano
lost his balance and was thrown out into the water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the </span>rear <span style="">wheels of the vehicle reached the water of the river, it finally
stopped.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“<span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
found himself lying upward at the water edge under the vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not move because his chest was
pressed down by an under chassis iron bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His feet were between the two rear wheels of the vehicle pointing
northward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While his body was submerged
in the shallow water, his head was above water and near the left rear side of
the weapon’s carrier.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Then <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span> moved
toward the stalled vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> was just about five
(5) meters northwest of the vehicle in an upgrade level and while <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span> was beside him, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> opened fire with his automatic carbine at the
people in the front seat of the weapon’s carrier.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“After this, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span>
went much closer to the vehicle and told the mortally wounded <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘What a
fate, Pare.’ Then <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> ran northward while <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> went away toward the
west.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The two automatic <span class="SpellE">gunfires</span> alarmed Jose
Medrano who was left at the gravel pit and Lucia Domingo who was in her
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Jose Medrano,
having heard the <span class="SpellE">gunfires</span> to have come from the east
in the direction of the ascending road and failing to hear anymore the revving
of the engine of the weapon’s carrier, he immediately dashed toward the
ascending road to find out what happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As he neared the vehicle, he met <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>
holding an automatic carbine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
time <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> was about ten (10) meters west of the
stalled weapon’s carrier proceeding westward.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When Jose Medrano got near the weapon’s carrier, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>, between gasp of breath, warned him not to get
nearer because they too might shoot him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also requested him to immediately go to <span class="SpellE">Tallang</span>
and tell his father <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> Domingo to look for a
vehicle to bring them to a hospital in <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose complied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the case of Lucia Domingo, when she heard the gunshots from the
direction of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Paranan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>, she asked councilman <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balanay</span> to accompany
her to verify what were they all about.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the two went out of the road, Lucia saw <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pigao</span> coming from the south in the direction of the
river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
entered his house but came out of it momentarily.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Once in the road in front of his house, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>,
with both hands beckoned Lucia to approach him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Lucia went near <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>, he told
her:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘<span class="SpellE">Comadre</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> were
shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have a companion but I don’t
know if he too was hit.’ He even offered to accompany her to the place where <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> and his companions were, but Lucia declined.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Instead, Lucia asked the help of her neighbors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among those who respondent were Felipe <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span>, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Zalun</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dencio</span> Robles and <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
Robles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These men went to the river and
came upon the ill-stricken weapon’s carrier with its fatally injured
passengers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They saw <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> slumped on the steering
wheel but still alive, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> curled on his
father’s lap already lifeless, Rodolfo prostrate on the right shoulder of the
road but still breathing and <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> pinned down
under the vehicle but otherwise unhurt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“One of the men went back to get a hammock while the others pushed
the weapon’s carrier forward to free <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> from
it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When the man with the hammock arrived, one of the men carried the
dead <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> while the rest put <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
in the hammock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Father and son were then
brought to their house, then, the men went back for Rodolfo who was also placed
in a hammock and brought to the same place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> was helped to his feet and
accompanied to the house of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> asked Lucia to give him a piece
of cloth to bind his wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lucia
removed one of the curtains in their house and gave it to <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> wrapped the
curtain around his chest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the presence of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Zalun</span>, Felipe
<span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> <span class="SpellE">Fronda</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> Robles and others,
Lucia asked her husband <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> who shot them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘We were shot by men of <span class="SpellE">Herrero</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span>.’ Then <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> added:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘I’m
dying, look after our children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I’m
going with <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>.’ After about three (3) minutes,
<span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> expired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Gannaban</span> also gave up the ghost a few
minutes thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>foregoing story
substantially conforms with the Sworn Statement (Exhibit ‘H-2’) dated August
26, 1969 of Lucia Domingo, Sworn Statement (Exhibit ‘4-Diga’) dated August 25,
1969 of <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> Medrano and Sworn Statement
(Exhibit ‘5’) dated August 26, 1969 of Jose Medrano.” (pp. 7-12, RTC Decision.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motive for the killings, as ascertained by Judge <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> from the records,
lay in at least two past incidents of humiliation, oppression and <span style="">physical </span>violence which <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> had suffered <span style="">in
</span>the hands of Domingo.</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“From the testimonies of
prosecution witnesses Lucia Domingo, </span><span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
Medrano, <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Dulce</span> <span class="SpellE">Baculi</span>, Jose Medrano and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span>
Domingo, the following story emerges:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“One harvest time before
the incident in question, accused <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> tried to bring to Alba the rice thresher of his
employer and patron <span class="SpellE">Gogo</span> <span class="SpellE">Herrero</span>
to do business therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For unexplained
reasons, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Domingo, asserting his misplaced
authority, put down his foot and prevented the entry of </span><span class="SpellE">Herrero’s</span> rice thresher in his <span style="">territory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fermin’s</span>
arbitrary action was of course resented by <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“But a more serious incident between the two occurred on a night in
the month of February or March 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was the last canvassing in the popularity contest for the 1969 Miss <span class="SpellE">Tallang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> and his wife attended the affair because <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> operated his sound system which was hired for that
occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a dance was going on, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span>, a native of <span class="SpellE">Tallang</span>, was creating trouble in the dancing place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> stopped the
music and approached <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> to calm him down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> shrugged
off <span class="SpellE">Fermin’s</span> entreaties and resumed his loathsome
behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unable to control his temper
any longer, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> slapped <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>
in front of so many people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
incident terribly humiliated <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> and cut deep
into his psyche.” (pp. 6-7, RTC Decision.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Diga’s</span> defense was an alibi which the
lower court summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“On <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1969">August 22, 1969</st1:date>,
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Herrero</span> instructed <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>
and her laborers <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Gamacam</span>,
Fabian del Rosario and <span class="SpellE">Edong</span> <span class="SpellE">Sayong</span>
to bring out <span class="SpellE">palay</span> from her bodega to be dried under
the sum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complying, the men brought out
forty sacks of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and spread the grains on a
pavement to dry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“At about <st1:time hour="15" minute="0">3:00 o’clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> and the laborers started
putting back the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> into the sacks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noticing that there was no sack needle to sew
and close the sacks, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> went to the house of
Alfonso Cruz which was just a few meters away from Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Herrero’s</span>
to borrow a sack needle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirty (30)
minutes later on <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> returned with the needle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After re-sacking the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, the men
carried them to the bodega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they
cleaned the yard where they dried the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> finishing
the work at <st1:time hour="16" minute="55">4:55 o’clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The men washed and cleaned
themselves and called it a day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Minutes later at about 5:30 o’clock, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>
went out into the road and was surprised to see a crowd in front of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Herrero’s</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
heard someone in the crowd excitedly saying that somebody was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Curious to know who was killed, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> went nearer to the crowd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a certain Mrs. Martin, a niece of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Domingo, who said that his uncle <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
had been shot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> went back to the house of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Herrero</span> and informed her of what he just heard.” (pp.
14-15, RTC Decision.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To show that it was impossible for him to be in Alba at the time
of the killings, <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> testified that in 1969, only a
logging trail, used mainly by logging trucks and weapons carriers, connected <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Jose</st1:place></st1:city> and Alba.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reaching Alba by boat through the river, would take three or four
hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On foot, one would have to cross
two rivers, one in <st1:city><st1:place>San Jose</st1:place></st1:city> and another
in <span class="SpellE">Tallang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
horseback, it would take two hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="8" day="22" year="1969">August 22, 1969</st1:date>, the road, being very
muddy, was impassable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Diga</span> believed that Mayor <span class="SpellE">Pallagao</span> instigated the filing of the criminal case against
him on account of politics and that the Mayor coached the Medrano brothers to
testify falsely against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
Sworn Statement, <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> alleged that the real assassin
was a certain <span class="SpellE">Orlino</span> Robles of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Alba, <span class="SpellE">Baggao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, who
was bitter at <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> for having grabbed his
five-hectare <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the killings, <span class="SpellE">Orlino</span>
allegedly disappeared from Alba.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated <st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1990">May

of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Domingo, his son, <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>,
and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Gannaban</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He sentenced <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> for each of the murders and to
indemnify the heirs of each victim in the amount of P30,000.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused appealed and seeks the reversal of that decision on
the grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that his guilt was not
proven beyond reasonable doubt; (2) that the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses were fraught with inconsistencies; and (3) that the case was decided
by a judge (Judge <span class="SpellE">Hilarion</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>)
who had not heard a single witness testify at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Diga’s</span> alibi (the weakest of possible
defenses) cannot stand in the face of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
Medrano and the dying declaration of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
positively identifying him as one of the gunmen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the Court:</p>

<blockquote>“Witness <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> Medrano positively
identified accused <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span>
as the one who twice fired his automatic long gun at <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> and Rodolfo.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> Medrano had the full opportunity to see the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span>, knew the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span>,
and therefore, he was telling the truth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This conclusion is in effect a reaffirmation of the earlier conclusion
of this Court when it denied the demurrer to evidence of the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is no question that <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
Medrano was in the group of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> in the weapon’s
carrier when the incident in question happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, defense witness Felipe <span class="SpellE">Cacatian</span> in
his written statement (Exhibit ‘I’) dated <st1:date month="8" day="26" year="1969">August 26, 1969</st1:date> narrated that -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">“‘Immediately, some of us carried the body
of <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, Rodolfo and <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
Domingo while some assisted <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> who could still
manage himself to walk and we brought them to our barrio (Alba).’</p>

<blockquote>“The incident took place between <st1:time hour="16" minute="30">4:30</st1:time>
and <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it was still
bright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the first burst of automatic
gunfire, <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> was at the back carrier of the
vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, very easy to believe,
because it conforms with human nature, that upon hearing the gunfire, <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> instinctively turned his head toward the
direction of the gun reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, at
the west side of the ascending road at a distance which could not be more than
ten (10) meters, he saw <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> who was
holding a gun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There may have been <span class="SpellE">talahib</span> growth
alongside the ascending road but they were sparse and could not have provided
cover to the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> could not have mistaken the identity of <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> because he personally knew him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
oftentimes saw <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> in Alba in the company <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“But that was not all because <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
Medrano saw <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> a
second time - and this time, he saw him actually firing his automatic long arm
at the persons in the front seat of the weapon’s carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was when, after the first volley of
automatic gunfire, the weapon’s carrier rolled down backwards throwing <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> into the water.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> laid flat in the water face
upwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The river was shallow at the
water edge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While his body was submerged
in the water, his head was above it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
could not move because his chest was pinned down by an under-chassis iron bar -
which means that his back rested on the riverbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His head was toward the south but near the
western side of the vehicle while his feet were between the rear wheels
directed northward.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In this position, <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> had a clear
view of the western and northern vicinity of the vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span> approached the vehicle and <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>,
standing at just around five (5) meters northwest of the vehicle on a place
higher in elevation than the water level, opened fire at the victim, <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> clearly saw him for nothing blocked his line of
sight.” (pp. 16-19, RTC Decision.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">He had a good view of the men who fired the shots from the rear
of the motor vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Autopsy
findings of <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Baculi</span>
confirmed that the deceased were shot in the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s argument that <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> could not have seen the assassins because he was
down in the water, is not well taken because he fell off the motor vehicle only
<span style="">when </span>it slid back into the river
<u>after</u> <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> was shot and lost control of the
steering wheel as a result.</p>

<blockquote>“The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> does not
stand alone as the inculpating evidence against <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were strong corroborating evidences, to
wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> was already in his house and in the throes of death,
in answer to the query of wife, he identified in the presence of several
persons those who ambushed and fired at them as <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Diga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
declaration was made within the hour after he was shot and just three minutes
before he expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when he made
the utterances, he added, ‘I’m dying.’ Thus, <span class="SpellE">Fermin’s</span>
declaration as to the identity of his killer is an ante-mortem declaration
admissible in evidence under Sec. 37, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules on
Evidence. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It can also be part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span> under
Sec. 42 of the same Rule.” <span class="GramE">(p. 21, RTC Decision.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moments after the shooting, Jose Medrano met <span class="SpellE">Diga</span>
holding a long gun just ten (10) meters west of the weapon’s carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was going westward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Using the familiar Yankee
expression:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose Medrano <span style="">saw </span><span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span>
holding the smoking gun.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court dismissed as pure invention-hearsay Felipe <span class="SpellE">Cacatian’s</span> allegation that when <span class="SpellE">Fermin’s</span>
brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> Robles, asked who shot him, his
reply was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“I did not see because they
were among the bushes and it was dark,” (p. 13, RTC Decision) and that in a
weak voice, he identified the killer as “the man of <span class="SpellE">Lelo</span>”
(p. 21, RTC Decision).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
observed:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">This</span> witness would make of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
a liar even at the point of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
could <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> have said that the assailant were ‘among
the bushes’ when there were no bushes but a few <span class="SpellE">talahibs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
have said that at the time of the incident in question it was dark when it vas
only between <st1:time hour="16" minute="30">4:30</st1:time> and <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the afternoon?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>
have said at one time that he did not see the <span class="SpellE">gunwielder</span>
and just a few minutes later, he would say that they were the ‘men of <span class="SpellE">Lelo</span>?’ How could <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> have said
that his assailants were ‘the men of <span class="SpellE">Lelo</span>’ when there
is no one by that name in <span class="SpellE">Baggao</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But more than that, the Court cannot believe
this witness because in his written statement (Exhibit ‘I’), he stated:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">‘That I and my companions suggested that
Mrs. Domingo, wife of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>, will inquire from the
latter who shot them and the late <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Domingo who
could still talk told the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘<span class="SpellE">Lucing</span>, <span class="SpellE">ti</span> <span class="SpellE">nangi</span>

statement is translated, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">‘<span class="SpellE">Lucing</span>, the ones

<p class="BODY">Since a criminal case generally hangs on the credibility of the
testimonies of witnesses and the trial court had the fullest opportunity to
observe their demeanor while they were giving their evidence, we are not
inclined to disturb its finding that the guilt of the accused was established
