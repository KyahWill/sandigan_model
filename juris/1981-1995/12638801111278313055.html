<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found no merit in the petition and dismissed
it in its Decision promulgated on 9 November 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Pertinently, it ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"We cannot sustain the contention of the petitioner that par.
2 of Art. 275 of the Revised Penal Code does not apply to him since the
evidence allegedly shows that it was Ernesto Reyes, the tricycle driver, who <u><span style="">negligently</span></u><span style=""> </span>caused the accident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner misses the import of the provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provision punishes the <u><span style="">failure</span></u><span style=""> </span>to help or render assistance to another whom the offender <u><span style="">accidentally</span></u><span style=""> </span>wounded or injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accidental means that which happens by chance
or <span style="">fortuitously, without intention and
design and which is unexpected, unusual and unforeseen (Moreno, Phil. Law
Dictionary, 1972 ed., p. 7 citing De La Cruz v. Capital Insurance &amp; Surety
Co., 17 SCRA 559).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is
enough to show that petitioner accidentally injured the passengers of the
tricycle and failed to help or render them assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no need to prove that petitioner was
negligent and that it was his negligence that caused the injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the factor of criminal negligence is
involved, Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code will come into play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last paragraph of Art. 365 provides that
‘the penalty next higher in degree to those provided for in this article shall
be imposed upon the offender who fails to lend on the spot to the injured party
such help as may be in his hands to give.’ Petitioner was charged under par. 2
of Art. 275 not under Art. 365 of the Revised Penal Code."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">His motion to reconsider the above decision wherein he strongly
urged for reconsideration because:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“. . . We find it hard to visualize that the accused may be
penalized twice for an ‘accident' and another for 'recklessness', both of which
arose from the same act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We submit that
there could not be a valid charge under Article 275, when, as in the case at
bar, there <span style="">is </span>already a pending
charge for reckless imprudence under Article 365 of the Revised Penal
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is our view that the charge
under Article 275 presupposes that there is no other charge for reckless
imprudence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">having been denied in the Resolution of
17 May 1990,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner filed the instant petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before Us he raises this sole issue:</p>

<blockquote>"Could there be a valid charge for alleged abandonment under Article
275, par. 2 of the Revised Penal Code which provides as basis for prosecution,
‘2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyone who shall fail to help
another whom he has <u><span style="">accidentally</span></u><span style=""> </span>wounded or injured’ when, he was previously
charged with 'reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with multiple
physical injuries' under Article 265 (sic) of the Revised Penal Code?"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">He maintains the negative view and supports it with the argument
that “[f]or the same act, that is, the vehicular collision, one could not be
indicted in two separate informations at the same time based on 'accident' and
‘recklessness’, for there is a world of difference between ‘reckless
imprudence’ and ‘accidentally'." As expanded by him:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x since petitioner is facing a criminal charge <span style="">f</span>or reckless imprudence pending before
Branch 68 of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Metro Manila x x x which
offense carries heavier penalties under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code,
he could no longer be charged under Article 275, par. 2, for abandonment x x x
for having allegedly failed 'to help or render assistance to another whom he
has <u><span style="">accidentally</span></u><span style=""> </span>wounded or injured'."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Our resolution of 1 August 1990 We required respondents to
comment on the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Comment filed on 10 September 1990, respondent People of
the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General, putting the issue
squarely, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x whether or not prosecution for negligence under Article
365 of the Revised Penal Code is a bar to prosecution for <span style="">abandonment </span>under Article 275 of the
same Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">answers it in the negative because said
Articles penalize different and distinct offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule on double jeopardy, which petitioner
has, in effect, invoked, does not, therefore, apply pursuant to existing
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the petition
should be dismissed <span style="">for </span>lack of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our resolution of 13 March 1991 We gave due course to the
petition and required the parties to submit simultaneously their respective
memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner submitted his on
22 April 1991<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
while the People moved that its Comment be considered <span style="">as</span> its memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that the petitioner is
actually invoking his right against double jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, however, failed to directly and
categorically state it in his petition or deliberately obscured it behind a
suggestion of possible resultant absurdity of the two informations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason seems obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He forgot to raise squarely that issue in the
three courts below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, to do
so would have been a futile exercise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he was arraigned, tried, and convicted in the Metropolitan Trial
Court of Pasig in Criminal Case No. 2793, he was not yet arraigned in Criminal
Case No. 64294 before the Regional Trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As stated above, the judgment of conviction in the former was rendered
on <u>29</u> <u>June</u> <u>1987</u>, while his arraignment in the latter took
place only on <u>27</u> <u>April</u> <u>1989</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the conditions for double jeopardy to
attach is that the accused must have been arraigned in the previous case.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In <u>People</u> <u><span style="">vs.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Bocar</u>, <u>supra.</u>, We
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Legal jeopardy attaches only (a) upon a valid indictment, (b)
before a competent court, (c) after arraignment, (d) <span style="">a </span>valid plea having been entered, and (e) the case was dismissed
or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, he is charged for two separate offenses under the
Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People</u> <u>vs.</u>
<u>Doriquez</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
We held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is a cardinal rule that the protection against double
jeopardy may be invoked only for the same offense or identical offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A simple act may offend against two (or more)
entirely distinct and unrelated provisions of law, and if one provision
requires proof of an additional fact or element which the other does not, an
acquittal or conviction or a dismissal of the information under one does not
bar prosecution under the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Phrased
elsewise, where two different laws (or articles of the same code) defines two
crimes, prior jeopardy as to one of them is no obstacle to a prosecution of the
other, although both offenses arise from the same facts, if each crime involves
some important act which is not an essential element of the other."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Peop</u><u><span style="">le</span></u>
<u><span style="">vs.</span></u><span style=""> <u>B</u></span><u>acolod</u>, <u>supra.</u>,
from the act of firing a shot from a sub-machine gun which caused public panic
among the people present and physical injuries to one, informations for
physical injuries through reckless imprudence and for serious public
disturbance were filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused pleaded
guilty and was convicted in the first and he sought to dismiss the second on
the ground of double jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ruled:</p>

<blockquote>“The protection against double jeopardy is only for the same
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A simple act may be an offense
against two different provisions of law<span style=""> </span>and
if one provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not,
an acquittal or conviction under one does not bar prosecution under the
other."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Since the informations were for separate
offenses - the first against a person and the second against public peace and
order - one cannot be pleaded as a bar to the other under the rule on double
jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two informations filed against petitioner are clearly for
separate offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first, Criminal
Case No. 64294, for reckless imprudence (Article 365), falls under the sole
chapter (Criminal Negligence) of Title Fourteen (Quasi Offenses) of Book Two of
the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second,
Criminal Case No. 2793, for Abandonment of one's victim (par. 2, Art. 275),
falls under Chapter Two (Crimes Against Security) of Title Nine (Crimes Against
Personal Liberty and Security) of Book Two of the same Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quasi offenses under Article 365 are committed by means of <u><span style="">culpa</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Crimes against Security
are committed by means of <u><span style="">dolo</span></u><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in Article 365, failure to lend help to one's victim is
neither an offense by itself nor an element of the offense therein
penalized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its presence merely increases
the penalty by one degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last
paragraph of the Article specifically provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The penalty next higher in degree to those provided for in this
article shall be imposed upon the offender who fails to lend on the spot to the
injured parties such help as may be in hand to give.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Such being the case, it must be specifically alleged in the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information against
petitioner in this case does not so allege.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, failure to help or render assistance to
another whom one has accidentally wounded or injured is an offense under
paragraph 2 of Article 275 of the same code which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The penalty of <u>arresto</u> <u>mayor</u> shall be imposed
upon:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 80.55pt; text-indent: -15.75pt;">2. Anyone who
shall fail to help or render assistance to another whom he has accidentally
wounded or injured."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing distinctions satisfy the guidelines We made in <u>People</u>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Relova</u>, <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein We held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is perhaps important to note that the rule limiting the
constitutional protection against double jeopardy to a subsequent prosecution
for the same offense is not to be understood with absolute literalness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">identity
of offenses that must be shown need not be absolute identity:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first and second offenses may be regarded
as the 'same offense' where the second offense necessarily includes the first
offense or is necessarily included in such first offense or where the second
offense is an attempt to commit the first or a frustration thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for the constitutional plea of double
jeopardy to be available, not all the technical elements constituting the first
offense need be present in the technical definition of the second offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law here seeks to prevent harassment of
an accused person by multiple prosecutions for offenses which though different
from one another are nonetheless each constituted by a common set or
overlapping </span>sets <span style="">of technical
elements."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Undoubtedly then, no
constitutional, statutory or procedural obstacle barred the filing of the two
informations against petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
