 1987</st1:date>, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
questioned resolutions directed the immediate revocation of the appointment of
Dr. Angela P. Jordan to the position of Assistant Bank Physician of the Central
Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the issuance of an appointment in favor of herein private respondent, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> to the said
position.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1984</st1:date>,
the Promotions Board of the Central Bank, with a representative of the Civil
Service Commission in attendance, deliberated on the filling up of the vacant position
of Assistant Bank Physician of the Central Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Salary Grade 22).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It found Dr. Jordan,
who then had the rank of Coordinating Assistant (Salary Grade 20) as the only
next-in-rank employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After considering
further the qualifications of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
said Board certified her for promotion to the position of Assistant Bank
Physician and submitted the proposal to the Office of the Governor of the
Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it appears that as early as July, 1984,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> filed an application for the
position of Medical Director in the Central Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His papers were acted upon by the Promotions
Board and he was considered for the position of Physician (Salary Grade 16).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bank approved the Board's proposal in a
Resolution dated <st1:date year="1984" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1984</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

On <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1984</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> reported for duty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1984</st1:date>, he was issued his appointment as Physician.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1985</st1:date>,
the promotion of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to Assistant Bank Physician was approved by the Senior Deputy Governor of the
Central Bank under Personnel Action No. 001, Series of 1985.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

to take effect <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="2">February
 15, 1985</st1:date>, private respondent contested Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
appointment claiming that he was the next-in-rank employee and that he was more
qualified than she.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On May 16, 1985, the
Bank dismissed the protest on the grounds that the protest was filed beyond the
<span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period; that protestant is not the
next-in-rank employee as regards the contested position and, as such, he has no
legal personality to file the protest; and, that the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
aside from being the next-in-rank employee, met the requirements for promotion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent appealed to the Merit Systems Board (MSB for
short).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its decision dated <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1986</st1:date>, the MSB found the
appeal meritorious and ruled that private respondent should have been the one
appointed as Assistant Bank Physician.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Bank, through Mr. Sebastian V. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>,
Jr., Special Assistant to the Governor, in an undated petition for
reconsideration, prayed that the MSB decision be set aside and that the Bank's
decision upholding the appointment of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
be left undisturbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1987</st1:date>, the MSB set aside
its decision of <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1986</st1:date>
and confirmed the approval of the appointment of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the contested position.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 5, 1987, private respondent appealed to the Civil
Service Commission on the grounds that he was denied due process of law
inasmuch as he was not furnished a copy of the motion for reconsideration filed
by the Bank, and that the decision of the MSB dated January 28, 1987 is
contrary to the merit and fitness principles enshrined in the Civil Service Law
and the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1987</st1:date>, the Commission
forwarded the appeal to the Office of the Governor of the Central Bank for his
comment with the request that his comment be transmitted to the Commission
within ten (10) days from receipt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was furnished a copy of the appeal for her to submit her answer/comment thereon
within ten (10) days from receipt with a warning that her failure to do so
shall be considered a waiver of her right to submit the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of submitting her comment, Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
filed an Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion for Extension of Time to
File Comment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Central Bank, through
Mr. Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, Jr. filed a similar motion
alleging that the Bank received notice of the appeal on <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the Commission denied the motion of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on the ground that a protest case is not strictly an adversary proceeding where
protestant and <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> play active participation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1987</st1:date>,
the Commission issued Resolution No. 87-156 setting aside the decision of the
MSB dated <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1987</st1:date>
and directing the appointment of private respondent to the contested
position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On June 10, 1987, the
petitioner Central Bank filed a petition for reconsideration that the
department head enjoys wide latitude of discretion as regards the appointment
of department personnel and that question as to who is more competent is of no
consequence since private respondent was not yet an employee of the Central Bank
at the time Dr. Jordan was considered for promotion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the petitioner's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motion </span>for reconsideration was denied
by the Commission in Resolution No. 87-375 dated October 16, 1987 on the <u>sole</u>
ground that its Resolution dated May 26, 1987 had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on account of the failure of Dr. Jordan to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">file a </span>motion for reconsideration and
that the motion for reconsideration filed by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>,
Jr. for and in behalf of the Central Bank cannot be said to have been filed in
behalf of Dr. Jordan inasmuch as the Central Bank has no personality to file a
motion for reconsideration as it does not stand to be adversely affected or
personally aggrieved by the decision of the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the petitioner Central Bank that the
Civil Service Commission acted without or in excess of jurisdiction in revoking
the appointment of Dr. Jordan and in directing the issuance of the appointment
in favor of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> when all the while the
qualifications of Dr. Jordan were certified by the Promotions Board and a
representative of the Civil Service Commission who was present in the
deliberations of the same board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Bank added that the power of the Commission is limited to
determining whether or not the appointee has the appropriate eligibility and
qualification and that once such q<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ualification
</span>was certified, the Commission is duty bound to attest to the
appointment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Solicitor </span>General
prays for the dismissal of the instant petition on the ground that the decision
of the Merit Systems Board dated <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1986</st1:date> had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
for failure of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to appeal or seek reconsideration within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the
said decision, citing Section 2, Board Resolution No. III in relation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">39, </span>Presidential Decree No. 807.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent contends that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>Central Bank lacks the legal
personality to contest the validity of Resolution Nos. 87-375 and 87-156 as it
does not stand to be adversely affected or personally aggrieved by the decision
of the Commission, citing Sections 7 and 10 of Resolution No. 81-1329 of the
Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled principle that the appointing authority is
given ample discretion in the selection and appointment of qualified persons to
vacant positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">This </span>is a management prerogative which

Within the parameters of this principle, the right to select and appoint
employees is the prerogative of the employer which may be exercised without
being liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> provided that the exercise
thereof is in good faith for the advancement of the employer's interest and not
for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under
special laws or under valid agreements and provided further that such
prerogatives are not exercised in a malicious, harsh, oppressive, vindictive or
wanton manner, or out of malice or spite.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the Central Bank of the Philippines is
vested with the power of appointment under Section 14 of Republic Act No. 265,
as emended, otherwise known as the Central Bank Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At issue in this petition is the extent of
the power of the Civil Service Commission to approve or disapprove a particular
appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>May the Commission revoke
an appointment and direct the issuance of the appointment to somebody else whom
it believes is more qualified for the position?</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Civil Service Act of 1959,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The authority of the Commission is limited to approving or reviewing the
appointment in the light of the requirements of the law governing the Civil
Service.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the qualifications of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
were never disputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that she
was qualified was attested to by the Promotions Board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A representative of the Commission was
present in the deliberation of the said board.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent anchors his protest on the ground that he is more
qualified than the appointee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
well-settled that when the appointee is qualified, as in this case, and all the
other legal requirements are satisfied, the Commission has no alternative but
to attest to the appointment in accordance with the Civil Service Laws.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>The Commission has no authority to
revoke an appointment on the ground that another person is more qualified for a
particular position. It also has no authority to direct th<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">e</span> appointment of a substitute of its
choice. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>To do so would be an encroac<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hment</span> on the discretion vested upon
the appointing authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An appointment
is essentially within the discretionary power of whomsoever it is vested,
subject to the only condition that the appointee should possess the
qualifications required by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent alleges, however, that the power of
appointment is not absolute and that the Commission is empowered to approve or
disapprove the same, citing Section 9(h) of Article V of the Civil Service Decree
and Section 4 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of Civil Service </span>Commission
Resolution No. 83-343.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As noted earlier, the
appointment is subject to verification by the Commission as to whether or not
the appointing authority complied with the requirements of the law, otherwise,
it may revoke the appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
to conclude that the Commissioner may also direct the appointment of individuals
other than the choice of the appointing power is certainly not contemplated by
the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 9(h) of Article V of
the Civil Service Decree provides that the Civil Service Commission is
authorized to perform the following functions with respect to appointments in
the Civil Service, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Approve all appointments, whether original or promotional,
to positions in the civil service</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">except
those of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">presidential </span>appointees,
members of the Armed Forces of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Philippines,
police forces, firemen, and <span class="SpellE">jailguards</span>, and <u>disapprove
those where the appointees do not possess appropriate eligibility or required
qualifications</u>.” xxx. (Emphasis supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">From the foregoing, it is clear that the
Commission has the authority to check whether or not the appointee possesses
the appropriate civil service eligibility or the required qualifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he does, his appointment must be approved;
if not it should be disapproved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
other criterion may be employed by the Commission when it acts on an
appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, when as in this case, it is not disputed that the
appointee, Dr. Jordan, is qualified for the contested position, the Commission
exceeded its power in revoking her appointment on the ground that private
respondent is more qualified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission cannot substitute its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">will </span>for
that of the appointing authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be true that private respondent has an edge over Dr.
Jordan in terms of educational attainment inasmuch as the former holds a
post-graduate degree in Medicine from a foreign educational institution and
considering that he has had experience and training in reputable institutions
here and abroad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, under the
pertinent rules on promotion obtaining in the Central Bank,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

educational attainment and training experience are just among the factors to be
considered in the promotion of its employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The other factors to be considered are performance rating, experience
and outstanding accomplishments, physical characteristics and personality
traits and potential.</p>

<p class="BODY">After evaluating the qualifications of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the Central Bank arrived at the conclusion that she outranks the others in
point of experience, rank, salary and service in the Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
holds the degree of Doctor of Medicine and is a graduate of the University of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had been with the Central Bank since <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that during this span of time, she
had displayed a high degree of efficiency, dedication and initiative in
discharging the duties and responsibilities of her position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also attended various seminars,
conferences, symposia and other special training courses that enriched her
knowledge in the field of medicine.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to her promotion to the contested position, she held the
position of bank physician from <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="9">September

immediate superior. It ruled that the absence of performance ratings in the
case of private respondent, considering his point of service, places the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> and the protestant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

to the contested position on <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="10">October

</span>It was, therefore, impossible to consider him for appointment to the

the legal personality to contest the decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

this Court held that it is the appointing authority who stands adversely
affected where the Civil Service Commission disapproves the appointment
made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This rule is acknowledged by the
Solicitor General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
Solicitor General contradicted himself by insisting that the decision of the
MSB dated October 28, 1981 became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
for failure of Dr. Jordan to file a motion for reconsideration when all the
while the Central Bank filed a timely motion for reconsideration thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Central Bank, as the appointing authority is the one
which can defend its appointment since it knows the reasons for the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any final determination of the issue can only
be enforced through it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is
the act of the appointing authority that is being questioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, when the Commission directed the
Central Bank to submit its Comment on the appeal filed by private respondent
the Commission must have been aware that the participation of the Central Bank
is indispensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the Commission
also directed Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to file a separate Comment, it denied the latter's request for an extension of
time within which to file the same on the ground <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">that a pro</span>test case is not strictly an adversary proceedings
where the protestant and the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> play active
roles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Commission pointed out that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>protest case is an action of the
protestant against a determination made by<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">
</span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">appointing </span>authority,
a determination which only the appointing authority could defend inasmuch as it

Thus, for the Commission to say thereafter that the decision became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for failure of Dr. <st1:country-region><st1:place>Jordan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to appeal is obviously erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact the Commission is now in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After making the parties believe that the

make a total turn about by alleging that the participation of the Central Bank
is inconsequential as it lacks the requisite legal personality.</p>
