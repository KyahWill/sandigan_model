Court, Branch 53 of Rosales, Pangasinan, herein petitioner seeks the reversal

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds Carlito Martos guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the offense of selling marijuana, defined and penalized
under Article II, Section 4 of Republic Act 6425, as amended, otherwise known
as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, and hereby sentences him to suffer the

<p class="BODY">According to the Information dated March 20, 1989, the crime was
committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 1st day of February 1989, in barangay
Carmen East, municipality of Rosales, Pangasinan, New Republic of the
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously
sell, give away and deliver fifty (50) grams of dried marijuana leaves worth
P50.00 to MSgt. Rogelio Raguine, an incognito NARCOM agent, a prohibited drug
and without any authority of the law."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts according to the version of the prosecution, reveal
that on February 1, 1989, acting on the tip of a confidential informer (C.I.)
or asset, a team from the First Narcotics Regional Unit based in Urdaneta,
Pangasinan, composed of Sgts. Rogelio Raguine, Peregrino Benito and Ramon
Padilla, went to Bgy. Carmen East, Rosales, Pangasinan at about 4:00 o'clock in
the afternoon, in pursuit of a certain "Lito" who was engaged in
selling marijuana to students and adults alike.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Lito", whose full name is Carlito Martos, was washing
his feet at the water pump near his house when Sgt. Raguine and the CI
approached him.  Sgt. Raguine, acting as
posuer-buyer, was introduced by the CI to "Lito".  The former then inquired if "Lito"
had "stuff" for sale, and upon eliciting an affirmative answer,
ordered P50.00 worth of stuff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lito went inside his house and returned after a while to where
Sgt. Raguine and the CI were.  He handed
the stuff contained in a small plastic bag, to Sgt. Raguine while the latter
gave Carlito Martos a P50.00 bill, which serial number was earlier recorded by
him in a log book.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
After being convinced that the content of the plastic bag was marijuana, Sgt.
Raguine immediately signalled Sgts. Benito and Padilla, who were then positioned
in separate places some 10 meters away from the water pump, to close in and
effect arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">After identifying themselves as NARCOM agents, Sgts. Benito and
Padilla seized Carlito Martos, but the latter was able to wrench himself free
from his captors and escaped.  The three
agents pursued him, but when Carlito Martos heard a shot, he stopped running,
raised his hands and surrendered.  It
turned out that the shot was fired from the gun of Sgt. Padilla which
accidentally hit the CI on the left arm.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereupon, Carlito Martos was brought to the NARCOM office in Urdaneta,
Pangasinan.</p>

<p class="BODY">The stuff, which was marked as Exhibit "D" was turned
over to the PC/INP Crime Laboratory, Camp Crame, for analysis.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lauena Layador, Assistant Chief of the
Chemistry Branch of PC/INP Crime Laboratory Service conducted a microscopic,
chemical and chromatographic examination, to determine whether the specimen
submitted was marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> The
report, Exhibit "C" confirms the fact that the stuff was marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, Carlito Martos, a jeepney conductor, testified
that in the afternoon of February 1, 1989, between 4:00 and 5:00 o'clock, as he
was washing his feet at a pump well, some 3 meters away from his house, he
heard a person shout, <i>"dadiay ni, dadiay ni, paltogan yon."</i> He
then saw three men coming down from the dike, two of whom drew their guns.  Frightened, he tried to run away, but when
he heard a shot, he stopped and raised his hands.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the three men overtook him, one of them handcuffed him while
the other two started hitting him with the butt of their guns, boxing and
kicking him.  As a tricycle was being
called, one of the men took "a plastic bag with leaves inside" from
his pocket and placed it in his hands.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Carlito refused to hold it and instead dropped the thing.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> The
above testimony was corroborated by two other defense witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the NARCOM station in Urdaneta, the agents tried to force
appellant to sign a document, but the latter refused.  The agents even called a CLAO lawyer who also insisted that he
sign the documents since "there is nothing wrong" about it.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
He claims that he was also forced to sign his name on a cellophane<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and cajoled to settle the case for P25,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> He
was then jailed and only released at 1:00 o'clock the following day.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal, Carlito Martos' argues that the evidence adduced
by the prosecution is not sufficient to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt
of the crime he was convicted of.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> The
Solicitor General joins the appellant in the latter's plea for acquittal.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
They alleged that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are highly
improbable, self-contradictory and contradictory.  Thus, they outlined several inconsistencies in the testimonies of
the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that persons who sell prohibited drugs
deserve the severest sanctions of the law for the misery they caused our
people, especially the youth, many of whom have lost their future because of
the evil influence of drugs.  While this
Court strongly commends the efforts of the law enforcement officers who are
engaged in the difficult and dangerous task of apprehending and prosecuting
drug traffickers, the Court cannot simply disregard the many reports of false
arrest of innocent persons for extortion and blackmail.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the findings of facts of the trial
courts deserve great weight and respect for they have the privilege of
examining the demeanor of the witnesses while on the witness stand and
determine the veracity of the their testimonies.  The rule, however, admits of certain exceptions, such as (1) when
the conclusion is a finding based entirely on speculations; (2) when the
inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) where there is
grave abuse of discretion; (4) when the judgment is based on misapprehension of
facts; and (5) when the court, in making its findings, went beyond the issues
of the case and the same are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant
and the appellee.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar calls for a careful scrutiny of the records due
to the irreconcilable differences in the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses which weakens the case for the People.  We cannot but observe that the trial judge did a poor analysis
and synthesis of the facts as to deserve admonition.</p>

<p class="BODY">For instance, the P50.00 bill which was supposed to have been
offered to the accused-appellant to purchase the marijuana was not formally
offered in evidence<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
although it was marked as exhibit for the prosecution during the testimony of
Sgt. Raguine.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Notwithstanding, the trial court referred to it as Exhibit "C"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
in one part of its decision, then again as Exhibit "D" in another
part<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
and even relied on it to support its findings that said evidence consummated
the transaction.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision further states that the confidential informer was wounded on the
right arm,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
when all the testimonies of both the prosecution and defense witnesses
consistently state that the informer was hit on the left arm.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our Code of Judicial Conduct mandates that a "judge should
be the embodiment of competence, integrity and independence."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
He is expected to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality
of the judiciary such that he is likewise expected to be studious and cautious
in making decisions.  He should exhibit
an industry and application commensurate with the duties imposed upon him.  Sadly, the same is wanting among the virtues
of the trial judge in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellant and the Solicitor General that the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are replete with inconsistencies.  One point raised is that in the testimony of
Sgt. Raguine, it was not established whether the P50.00 bill was really handed
to the appellant.  Although he related
in his direct examination that he gave the bill to the accused before giving
the signal to his companions,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> he
did not reiterate this fact during the cross-examination and instead insisted
that upon ascertaining that the stuff was marijuana he immediately gave the
pre-arranged signal to his men.  No
corroboration on the handling of the P50.00 bill to the accused was made by the
other two prosecution witnesses, Sgts. Benito and Padilla who were likewise
present.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. Raguine further testified that he recorded the serial number
of the P50.00 bill in their logbook before the buy-bust operation was to take
place.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
But strangely enough, in his subsequent testimony, he was not able to produce
the logbook, allegedly because it could no longer be found in their office.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Sgt. Raguine also testified that the P50.00 bill was surrendered by the accused
when they were at their headquarters,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> yet
in his later testimony he gave another version and said that the bill was
recovered in "(the appellant's) right front pocket of his pants"
right after his arrest "at the vicinity of his house" (sic).<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. Raguine was supposed to be the star witness of the
prosecution, having acted as the posuer-buyer, but, in a short span of time<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
he seems to have had a poor recall of the incidents relative to the arrest of
accused-appellant.  Not only that:  he hedged, hesitated and involved himself in
apparent inconsistencies in his relation of the facts:</p>

was wrapped in a plastic cellophane.  I
am sorry, your Honor, but I could no longer remember the container.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.  Your have a poor memory.  You
know that you are going to be called as witness in Court and you did not take
note of all those things?  So you are

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">These are merely excerpts of Sgt.
Raguine's testimony, during the cross, re-direct and re-cross examination.  Considering the nature of his testimony, We
cannot but question his credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General further observed that "there was no
evidence presented to prove that the marijuana, marked as <u style="">Exhibits </u><u>"D" to "D-4"</u> (inclusive) in
court is the same marijuana allegedly sold by the accused-appellant to the
buy-bust team."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a> To
substantiate his observation, the Solicitor General called attention to the
fact that the endorsement letter was first sent to Camp Dangwa, La Trinidad,
Benguet, without the alleged marijuana stuff.  Luena Layador, the chemist who conducted the examination of the
specimen, testified that she had to go personally to Camp Dangwa to get the
specimen, together with other specimens;<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a> that

said plastic bag.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a> Nevertheless,

<p class="BODY">As manifested by the Solicitor General in his
"Manifestation" for accused-appellant's acquittal:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x An assiduous and thorough analysis of the evidence on
record disclosed that accused-appellant's conviction has <i>no basis</i>.  The prosecution's evidence in support of its
theory is not convincing.  If there was
any evidence presented, it was so slender and shaky, not presented with care
and thoroughness which the gravity of the offense demanded and, taken in its
entirety, is utterly insufficient to produce conviction beyond reasonable
doubt."<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All considered, We hold that the guilt of appellant Carlito
Martos has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is REVERSED and SET
ASIDE, and the appellant is hereby ACQUITTED on grounds of reasonable doubt.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
