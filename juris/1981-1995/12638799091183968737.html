petitioners' motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 6, 1982, herein private respondent Bank of the
Philippine Islands (BPI) sued herein petitioners Peroxide Philippines
Corporation (Peroxide), Eastman Chemical Industries, Inc. (Eastman), and the
spouses Edmund O. <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> and Rose U. <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> (<span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>) in Civil Case No.
48849 of the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
Metro Manila for the collection of an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">indebtedness
of </span>Peroxide wherein Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>
bound themselves to be <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the filing of said action, the trial court, then presided
over by Judge Gregorio G. Pineda, ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary
attachment which was actually done on <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="1">January
 7, 1983</st1:date> after BPI filed an attachment bond in the amount of
P32,700,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' properties
were accordingly attached by the sheriff.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1983</st1:date>,
Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span> moved to lift the attachment,
which motion was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="1">January
 14, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On said date and
on motion of BPI, it was granted up to <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="1">January
 17, 1983</st1:date> to file a written opposition to the motion to lift the
writ of attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>BPI also filed a
motion to set for hearing the said motion to lift attachment and its opposition
thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on January 17, 1983, Judge Pineda issued two (2) orders,
the first, denying <span class="SpellE">BPI's</span> motion for a hearing, and,
the second, lifting the writ of attachment as prayed for by Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>BPI filed a
motion for reconsideration but, consequent to the then judiciary
reorganization, the case was re-raffled and assigned to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
of Judge Pastor Reyes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1983</st1:date>,
Judge Reyes issued an order with an explicit finding that the attachment
against the properties of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span> was
proper on the ground that they had disposed of their properties in fraud of
BPI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also directed the sheriff to
implement the writ of attachment upon the finality of said order.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a motion for partial reconsideration by BPI and some
exchanges between the parties, on December 17, 1984 the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">court, </span>this time with Judge <span class="SpellE">Eficio</span> B.

immediately," and directing the sheriff to execute said writ which "is

<p class="BODY">Contending that said order of <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1984</st1:date> was rendered with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, petitioners sought the annulment
thereof in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition in AC-G.R. SP No.
05043 of the Intermediate Appellate Court, wherein a temporary restraining
order was issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This restraining order

<p class="BODY">Petitioners then sought the review of said decision by this Court

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1986</st1:date>, this Court denied the aforesaid

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dissatified</span>, petitioners again filed an

two issues, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether Eastman

Peroxide, and (2) whether Rose U. <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> was bound by
the "Continuing Guarantee" executed by her husband, Edmund O. <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon
said motion, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1987</st1:date> the Court resolved
to deny the same for the reason, among others, that the clarification sought
regarding the propriety of the attachment of the properties of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span> involves questions of fact.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July </span>30, 1987,
BPI filed a motion to order <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Pulp and Paper
Mills, Inc. (<span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>), jointly and severally with
petitioners, to deliver to the sheriff the cash dividends declared on the
garnished shares of stock of said petitioners with said paper company, and to

<p class="BODY">In an exhaustive order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1987</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the trial court, now presided over by Judge Fernando L. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Gerona, </span>Jr. and wherein Civil Case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">No. </span>48849 was then pending, addressing all the issues raised by
the parties, granted <span class="SpellE">BPI's</span> motion for delivery of the
dividends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judge Gerona sustained the
position of BPI that dividends are but incidents or mere fruits of the shares
of stock and as such the attachment of the stock necessarily included the
dividends declared thereon if they were declared subsequent to the notice of
garnishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">He further held that the preliminary attachment, being a
provisional remedy, must necessarily become effective immediately upon the
issuance thereof and must continue to be effective even during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of an appeal from a judgment of the court which
issued the said provisional remedy and will only cease to have effect when the
judgment is satisfied or the attachment is discharged or vacated in some manner
provided by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion to cite the
officers of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place> was,
however, denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners moved for reconsideration but the same was denied for
the reason that the order of <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="5">May 29,
 1986</st1:date> of Judge Acosta was based on an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">parte</span></u></span> motion without
reasonable notice, hence a patent nullity for lack of due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the aforesaid order of <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1987</st1:date> held that the writ

<p class="BODY">Petitioners thereafter filed a second motion for reconsideration
which, however, remained pending and unresolved when Judge Gerona inhibited
himself from further sitting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said case was then re-raffled to
the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of Judge <span class="SpellE">Jainal</span> D.
<span class="SpellE">Rasul</span> who required the parties to re-summarize their
respective positions upon the issue of the attachment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, resolving the pending incidents before it, the court <u>a</u>

 23, 1988</st1:date>, which states, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that:</p>

<blockquote>"THIS Court thru Judge Gerona had arrived at the correct
conclusion that the contempt charge against the Officers of the Garnishee
Corporation cannot be sustained, for the reason that they relied on the Order
of the Court thru Judge Acosta under date of May 29, 1986 suspending the Writ
of Attachment and since said order was not then set aside, there was no order
or writ violated by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">said officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It follows <u>a</u> </span><u>fortiori</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> that the release of the cash dividends was
valid, legal and not contemptuous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, there is no reason to justify or deserve the return of

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>As correctly formulated
by respondent court, the threshold issue is the validity of the attachment of
the properties of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>, from which
arises the correlative question of whether or not the disputed cash dividends
on the garnished shares of stock are likewise subject thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily involved is the matter of the continuing
validity of the writ or whether or not the same was validly lifted and
suspended by the lower court's orders dated <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1983</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1986</st1:date>, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">BPI asserts that the discharge is illegal and void because the
order lifting the same is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 13,
Rule 57 of the Rules of Court which requires, among others, a prior hearing
before the judge may order the discharge of the attachment upon proof adduced
therein of the impropriety or irregularity in the issuance of the writ and the
defect is not cured forthwith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We may
mention in this regard that if the petition for the discharge of the writ
violates the requirements of the law, the trial judge does not acquire
jurisdiction to act thereon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that petitioner's motion to discharge was set for
hearing with notice to BPI but it is likewise true that counsel for the latter
asked for an opportunity to file a written opposition and for a hearing to
which he asked that petitioner Edmund O. <span class="SpellE">Mapua</span> be
subpoenaed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said counsel was allowed to
file a written opposition which he Seasonably did, but Judge Pineda denied both
the requested subpoena and hearing and, instead, granted the discharge of the
attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">bases </span>for <span class="SpellE">BPI's</span>
plaint that it was denied due process.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, it is undeniable that when the attachment is challenged for
having been illegally or improperly issued, there must be a hearing with the
burden of proof to sustain the writ being on the attaching creditor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

That hearing embraces not only the right to present evidence but also a
reasonable opportunity to know the claims of the opposing parties and meet
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right to submit arguments
implies that opportunity, otherwise the right would be a barren one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It means a fair and open hearing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

And, as provided by the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> Section 13 of Rule
57, the attaching creditor should be allowed to oppose the application for the
discharge of the attachment by counter-affidavit or other evidence, in addition
to that on which the attachment was made.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was, </span>therefore, correct in holding that, on
the above-stated premises, the attachment of the properties of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span> remained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">valid
</span>from its issuance since the judgment had not been satisfied, nor has the
writ been validly discharged either by the filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
or for improper or irregular issuance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise affirm the findings and conclusion of respondent
court that the order of Judge Acosta, dated May 29, 1986, suspending the writ
of attachment was in essence a lifting of said writ which order, having
likewise been issued <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> and
without notice and hearing in disregard of Section 13 of Rule 57, could not
have resulted in the discharge of the attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said attachment continued unaffected by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">so-</span>called order of suspension and
could not have been deemed inefficacious until and only by reason of its
supposed restoration in the order of <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1987</st1:date> of Judge Gerona.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under the facts of this case, the <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
discharge or suspension of the attachment is a disservice to the orderly
administration of justice and nullifies the underlying role and purpose of
preliminary attachment in preserving the rights <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>the parties <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> as an ancillary remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We, </span>therefore,
sustain the position of BPI that the Court of Appeals, in its judgment
presently under challenge, did not err in upholding the continuing and
uninterrupted validity and enforceability of the writ of preliminary attachment
issued in Civil Case No. 48849 since the order of discharge and, later, the
order of suspension of the trial court were void and could not have created the
operational lacuna in its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> as claimed by
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the cancellation
of the annotations regarding the levy on attachment of petitioners' properties,
procured by the sheriff pursuant to the aforesaid invalid orders, is likewise a
nullity and another levy thereon is not required.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We observe, however, that the records do not
disclose the lifting of the levy on the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
shares of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span> and on their real
properties in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners next call <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">attention </span>to the fact that when the
order of Judge Acosta of <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="12">December 17,
 1984</st1:date>, which directed the immediate execution and implementation of
the writ of attachment, was brought on a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition to the Intermediate Appellate Court in AC-G.R. SP No. 05043, said
court issued a temporary restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">They allege that although the restraining order was lifted by
said appellate court in its decision in the case on March 14, 1986, the same
was reinstated by the court "until further orders" in its order of <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1986</st1:date> in connection with
petitioners' motion for reconsideration therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="5">May
 14, 1986</st1:date>, respondent court denied the motion for reconsideration but,
so petitioners insist, "without, however, stating that it was lifting its
restraining order." When the case went on review to this Court in G.R. No.
74558, no mention was made regarding said restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioners assert, the said restraining
order had not been lifted; in effect arguing that the writ of attachment cannot
be implemented as a consequence.</p>

<p class="BODY">This misleading argument is confuted by the records <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">in </span>AC-G.R. SP No. 05043.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its aforesaid resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1986</st1:date>, the appellate court
stated that "(a)s of this date, <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="4">April
 23, 1986</st1:date>, the motion for reconsideration could not be considered in
view of the absence of the comment of the private respondents." Hence, the
court directed that "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)n order to maintain the
status quo of the parties, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
the restraining order issued by us on December 28, 1984 is hereby revived and

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, finding no merit in the motion for reconsideration,
the court denied the same, declaring that "(w)<span class="SpellE">ith</span>
this resolution, we find no need in resolving the Urgent Motion to Reconsider
and set aside Resolution of April 24, 1985 (sic, 1986) filed by the private

<p class="BODY">All incidents in AC-G.R. SP No. 05043 having been disposed of, it
follows that the temporary restraining order which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

merely temporarily reinstated for purposes of the motion for reconsideration
that was ultimately denied, was also necessarily lifted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, said temporary restraining
order, not having been supplanted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;

against the properties of all the petitioners herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>
moved for the discharge of the attachment on the ground that they were not
disposing of their properties in fraud of creditors, but they did not raise the
issue of their liabilities as being allegedly those of mere guarantors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They did so only when this Court resolved on <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1986</st1:date> that the writ of

<p class="BODY">Also, what was considered in AC-G.R. SP No. 05043 and thereafter
in G.R. No. 74558 was the matter of the validity of the attachment against
Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>, considering that, even before
the proceedings had reached the Intermediate Appellate Court in AC-G.R. SP No.
05043, BPI no longer had any attachment against Peroxide whose only remaining
asset in <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> had been levied upon and acquired by
its other creditors when Judge Pineda lifted the attachment obtained by BPI.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners seek to capitalize on a passage in the decision in
AC-G.R. SP No. 05043, hereinbefore quoted, where the appellate court stated
that "(w)e find nothing wrong with the attachment of the properties of
PEROXIDE," without mentioning Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was clearly in the nature of <span class="SpellE"><u>peccata</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>minuta</u></span>, a
plain case of harmless oversight, since the properties referred to in the decision
as having been alienated in fraud of BPI were properties of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>, not of Peroxide.</p>

motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="3">March
 24, 1986</st1:date> filed in said case specifically adverted to that prefatory
statement as being equivocal, with the following observation:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Actually no properties of Peroxide had

Private respondent further invites attention to the petition for <i>certiorari</i>

petitioners aver:</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>As earlier narrated,
this Court denied the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> in G.R. No.
74558, and when petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">persisted
in </span>seeking a clarification as to the nature of the liability of Eastman
and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>, the Court denied the same on the
ground that the clarification sought involves questions of fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As observed by respondent Court of Appeals,
the aforesaid ruling was erroneously construed by the lower court when it
declared that the properties of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>
should not, pending proper determination, be attached.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In doing so, the court below virtually lifted
or discharged the attachment even before its propriety had been determined.<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain respondent court's ratiocination in its decision under
review that when petitioners sought clarification from us regarding the
propriety of the attachment on the properties of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span>, and we said that this involves a question of fact,
what this means is that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> should determine the
propriety or regularity thereof, and such determination can only be had in
appropriate proceedings conducted for that purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, until such attachment has been found
to be improper and irregular, the attachment is valid and subsisting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as correctly posited by BPI, before the determination of
the liability of Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span> after trial
on the merits, the writ of preliminary attachment may properly issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that when Eastman and the <span class="SpellE">Mapuas</span> asked for the lifting of the attachment they
presented evidence that they were guarantors and not sureties of Peroxide, the
trial court could not have admitted such evidence or ruled upon that issue
since the same could be entertained only after a full-blown trial and not
before then.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Otherwise, we would have the procedural absurdity wherein the trial court would
be forced to decide in advance and preempt in an auxiliary proceeding an issue
which can and should be determined only in a trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proceeding in the issuance of a writ of preliminary
attachment, as a mere provisional remedy, is ancillary to an action commenced
at or before the time when the attachment is sued out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the attachment does not affect
the decision of the case on the merits, the right to recover judgment on the
alleged indebtedness and the right to attach the property of the debtor being
entirely separate and distinct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>rule, the judgment in the main
action neither changes the nature nor determines the validity of the
attachment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

petitioners are guarantors or sureties, there exists a valid cause of action
against them and their properties were properly attached on the basis of that
indubitable circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners bewail the
fact that respondent court allegedly handled the <i>certiorari</i> case,
CA-G.R. SP No. 15672 now on appeal before us, as if it were a petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i> by passing upon what they submit should be
considered as errors of judgment and not errors of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the foregoing disquisition, however, it
is readily apparent that the petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in
</span>said case faults the orders of the trial court as tainted with grave
abuse of discretion equivalent to a jurisdictional flaw.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The errors assigned necessarily involved a
discussion of erroneous conclusions and/or lack of factual bases much beyond
the pale of mere errors of judgment or misperception of evidence, and dwelt on
the improvident issuance of orders clearly arbitrary and oppressive for being
in defiance of the rules and devoid of justifying factual moorings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot, therefore, share the sentiments
and stance of petitioners on this score.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do we subscribe to petitioners' charge that respondent
court injudiciously gave due course to the aforesaid petition for <i>certiorari</i>
without requiring the prior filing and resolution of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are, admittedly,
settled exceptions to that requisite and which obtain in the present case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration was correctly
dispensed with by respondent court since the questions raised in the <i>certiorari</i>
