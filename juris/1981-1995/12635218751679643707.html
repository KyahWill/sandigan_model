On appeal is the Decision of the then Court of First Instance of 
Pangasinan, Branch X, San Carlos  City, in Criminal Case No. SCC-317 for
 Forcible Abduction with Rape, which convicted the accused, Graciano 
Olalia, Jr., of the crime charged and imposed the sentence of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
<p>
The People's version of the incident is summed up in its Brief as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On February 25, 1975, Julita Macaraeg, the complainant, sixteen 
(16) years old, provinciana, was a first year high school student at 
Bayambang National High School in Bayambang, Pangasinan.  She was 
dismissed from her classes at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  She started 
for home at around 5:30 P.M. as she was as­signed 'cleaner' for that 
day. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While walking alone along the National Highway in Barrio Nibaliw, 
Bautista, Pangasinan, she met Graciano Olalia, Jr., the accused, who was
 driving a Yamaha tricycle.  Suddenly, the accused stopped his tricycle 
near the complainant, and invited her for a ride.  She refused the offer
 and thereafter, ran along the road going to their house.  The accused 
jumped off his tricycle and ran after her.  She stumbled and was about 
to shout when the accused caught up with her, covered her mouth and 
slapped her several times.  As a result, she got dizzy.  She still 
refused to ride but the accused pulled her and threatened her with a 
balisong.
</p><p>
While she was inside the tricycle an old woman passed by and told the 
accused 'do not force a person to be your passenger to ride on your 
tricycle.' The accused countered that 'she is my cousin.' Before the 
accused brought complainant to the house of Puring (Eugenia Mabanglo) 
and Joaquin, accused's cousin and uncle respectively, he tied her hand 
to the right side and left hand to the left side of the tricycle.  Upon 
reaching Puring and Joaquin's house, the accused talked to the occupants
 of the house.  The accused untied complainant's hands and pulled her up
 to the balcony of the house.  The complainant saw Puring and Joaquin 
in­side a room, peeping at them. 
</p><p>
She called for help but the accused slapped her several times, 
threatened her with a balisong and bit her on her cheeks.  Afterwards, 
the accused pushed complainant to the floor and tied her hand to the 
floor made of bamboo slits.  With her feet apart, the accused got 
another rope and tied her ankles to the floor.  The accused also tied a 
hand­kerchief on complainant's mouth.  The complainant resisted 
accused's advances by wiggling her head, but accused slapped her, and 
laughed at the scar on her stomach.  Thereafter accused violated 
complainant's womanhood.  (pp. 8-25, TSN, March,10, 1976; pp. 29-­46, 
TSN, July 16, 1976).
</p><p>
All night, the accused guarded complainant.  He drank wine for supper 
whereas complainant was not given anything.  The accused released the 
complainant at around 6:00 A.M. on February 26, 1975, with a warning not
 to make any report; that if she makes a report and he sees her, he 
would kill her.  Upon release, complainant went straight home.
</p><p>
Upon reaching their house, she found no one at home.  Her mother was in 
Manila at that time.  Complainant’s mother arrived from Manila in the 
second week of March 1975.  Upon being confronted by her mother, she 
admitted that the accused abducted and abused her.  Thereafter, they 
filed a compIaint with the PC Headquarters in Bayambang, Pangasinan.  
(pp. 20, 23-25, Tsn. March 10, 1976; p. 1, Tsn, June 15, 1976; pp. 
56-61, tsn. September 8, 1976)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
Additionally, Laura Vda. de Macaraeg, complainant's mother, testified 
that she arrived in Pangasinan from Manila on March 16, 1975; that on 
March 21, 1975 her friend, Loleng Ventinilla Olalia, an aunt-in-law of 
the accused, sent for her and told her "your daughter is pitiful; she 
was abused by Jr. in the house of Joaquin; that Joaquin did not even 
help her on the contrary he is broadcasting in front of the store to the
 people".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  It was after 
receiving that information that the mother confronted complainant who 
admitted that she had, in fact, been abducted and abused but that she 
was afraid to disclose it because of threats to kill by the accused.  
That same afternoon, mother and daughter went to the Philippine 
Constabulary (PC) to lodge a complaint and two days later they went to 
the San Carlos Hospital where complainant underwent a physical 
examination.
</p><p>
The physician's medico-legal certificate, dated March 23, 1975 (Exhibit "A"), indicated the following findings:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "No laceration of hymen but vagina op admits 2 fingers easily without pain. </p>
  <p> "<em>Laboratory Findings</em>: </p>
  <p> "Pregnancy test - negative."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Complainant's mother further declared that notwithstanding Loleng 
Ventinilla's revelation, she did not con­front Puring and Joaquin about 
the incident<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> , and that when she asked Loleng to testify, the latter declined because the accused's father is her brother-in-law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
In defense, the accused interposed alibi stating that on the date of the
 incident he did not ply his trade as a tricycle driver because he was 
at his father's place at Sinabaan, Bautista, Pangasinan, the whole day 
helping him plant onions; that thereafter, he also helped in the 
preparation and construction of voting booths, which were to be used in 
the referendum of February 27, 1975.  His testimony was corroborated by 
his father and by Genaro Macasieb, a Barrio Councilman.  His cousin, 
Eugenia (Puring) Mabanglo, the owner of the house where the alleged rape
 took place, testified that she did not see the accused on the date of 
the incident; that she did not know complainant; and that the latter 
never set foot on her (Eugenia's) house.  Laureana Ventinilla Olalia, 
both in her Affidavit taken by the PC and in her testimony, de­clared 
that she did not know complainant nor did she see the latter in the 
evening of the incident.
</p><p>
After trial, the lower Court meted out a verdict of guilty, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, this Court finds accused Graciano Olalia, Jr., guilty 
beyond the shadow of doubt of the crime of Abduction with Rape as 
charged in the information defined and penalized under Article 335 in 
relation to Article 342 of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences 
him to suffer the penalty of <em>RECLUSION PERPETUA</em> and to indemnify the offended party in the mount of Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos without subsidiary imprisonment."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Challenging said Decision, accused now alleges:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The lower court erred in giving credence to the testimony of the 
alleged victim and in not deciding the case in accordance with Supreme 
Court decisions."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The issue raised centers on the credibility of com­plainant's testimony.
  We start with some basic principles.  It is well established that on 
matters of credibility, the Appellate Court will generally not disturb 
the find­ings of the Trial Court, as the latter is in a better position 
to decide said question, having heard the witnesses themselves and 
having observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the 
trial unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and 
value, which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.
</p><p>
Further, in crimes against chastity, conviction or acquittal of the 
accused depends almost entirely on the credibility of complainant's 
testimony.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  While rape is a
 detestable crime, it is an accusation easy to make, hard to prove, and 
still harder to defend by the person accused<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
 , so that such charge, based upon the lone and uncorroborated testimony
 of the victim, must be regarded with utmost caution and examined with 
the greatest care.  To warrant conviction, the testimony of the victim 
must be clear and free from serious contradic­tions, and her sincerity 
and candor, free from suspicion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  The evidence to be believable must not only proceed from the mouth of a
 credible witness but must be credible in itself such as the common 
experience and observations of mankind can approve as probable under the
 circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
Complainant declared that after the accused forced her to ride in his 
tricycle at about 5:30 in the afternoon of February 25, 1975 at Barrio 
Nibaliw, Bayambang, Panga­sinan, which is along the National Highway<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 , an old woman saw them and advised the accused not to force anyone to 
ride in his tricycle but that he replied that she was his cousin and the
 woman went her way; thereafter, the accused tied her right hand to the 
right side of the tri­cycle, her left hand to the left side, bound her 
feet together, and covered her mouth, presumably with a piece of cloth. 
 He then drove around before bringing her to the house of his first 
cousin, Puring (Eugenia) Mabanglo, at Bongato West, Bayambang, 
Pangasinan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> ; that while 
driving the tricycle with one hand, the accused was pointing a 
"balisong” at her neck with the other; that they arrived at Puring's 
house at around 7:00 P.M.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  or 8:00 P.M.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  where the accused forcibly pulled her up the stairs to the balcony of 
the house; that Puring and her father Joaquin, who were in the house and
 saw her struggling with accused, did not come to her succor despite her
 motions for help<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> ; that 
the accused bound both her arms close to her body with a rope wound 
around her waist, tied her ankles which were spread apart, also with a 
rope, to the flooring of the balcony made of bamboo slits spaced from 
each other at about the size of a ring finger, covered her mouth with a 
handkerchief knotted at the back of her head<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> , and thereafter abused her; that she saw Puring and Joaquin peeping at them without doing anything<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> ; she beckoned to them but they hid because a balisong was pointed at her neck.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  Puring is the beautician of her mother and they are friends but the former did nothing; she just watched.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
</p><p>
The above narration of events by complainant does not strike us as 
positively credible, probable, and entirely in accord with human 
experience.  When the accused replied to the old woman that complainant 
was her cousin, complainant said nothing to refute it so that at least 
the woman could have helped or could have reported the incident.  There 
is no evidence either that Puring Mabanglo and her father, Joaquin, had 
prior knowledge of the accused's intention to abduct and molest 
complainant.  Yet, they did not even demand an explanation nor evince 
surprise upon seeing the accused with a lady passenger bound to his 
tricycle, who after being untied, was forcibly pulled up the stairs to 
the balcony of their house by the accused.  There is no proof either 
that father and daughter were so terrified of the accused that they 
could not even utter a word of protest at the latter's actuations.  
Neither was it shown that they were threatened by the accused not to 
interfere.  Complainant merely stated that the accused talked to the 
occupants of the house in a loud voice while pulling her up the stairs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
</p><p>
It challenges credulity that any individual, man or woman, would be so 
callous as to tolerate, abet, or condone the commission of a crime as 
serious as rape in his/her abode without lifting a finger or trying to 
stop the offender specially if the latter be a younger relation, and 
would even go as far as to "watch" the employment of force against a 
hapless girl and the violation of her person.  Puring, being a woman, a 
beautician, and a friend of complainant's mother could not have been so 
passive and indifferent to the dastardly act of the accused, her cousin.
  And considering the nature of the offense, it is most unlikely that 
the culprit would select a place where detection would have been 
obvious.  Complain­ant was allegedly abused at an inhabited house 
abutting the street<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> , in the balcony thereof <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> , which even if walled might still be viewed from the stairs as the balcony adjoins the same<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> , and on a flooring made of slit bamboo, with visibility from underneath.
</p><p>
Complainant alleged that Puring and Joaquin could not come to her aid 
because the accused was pointing a "balisong" at her throat.  Neither 
one of them, however, faced threats to their life so that they could 
have asked for outside assistance, or could have even appealed to the 
accused to desist from employing force and satisfying his bestial 
desires.  Moreover, accused could not have been pointing the weapon at 
complainant's throat all the time.  He must have put it down when he 
allegedly tied complainant's arms and ankles and covered her mouth with a
 handkerchief, which he could not have done with one hand only.
</p><p>
It is noteworthy, too, that complainant did not immediately report her 
misfortune to her brothers and sisters, to the police, nor to barangay 
authorities much less to her mother upon the latter's arrival from 
Manila.  The mother allegedly came to know of the incident only through 
Loleng Olalia, accused's aunt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  It was only upon being confronted by her mother that complainant in­formed her of the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> 
</p><p>
The physical examination of complainant conducted on March 23, 1975, or 
26 days after the alleged incident, showed:  "No laceration of hymen but
 vaginal op admits 2 fingers easily without pain."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>
  In respect thereof, the examining physician declared that there was 
"no history of any pain" and that "in the passage there should be pain 
elicited upon introduction of the finger even with one finger only".  
The likelihood, therefore, exists that complainant surrendered her 
virginity willingly at some other place, considering the medical finding
 that complainant was no longer a virgin at the time of the examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> 
</p><p>
Although the accused's defense of alibi has not been proven as 
satisfactorily as to leave no room for doubt since he was not far from 
the vicinity of the crime scene, this cannot be the basis of conviction,
 the rule being that in a criminal prosecution, the State must rely on 
the strength of its own evidence and not on the weak­ness of the 
defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>  An aura of 
improbability sur­rounds the manner in which the alleged rape was 
committed.  Complainant's testimony is far from satisfactory and 
convincing.  If a reasonable doubt exists in the mind as to the 
commission or rape, as in this case, the verdict must be one of 
acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> 
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of conviction of the Trial Court is REVERSED and
 SET ASIDE, and the accused is hereby acquitted, upon reasonable doubt, 
of the crime with which he has been charged.

Costs de officio.
