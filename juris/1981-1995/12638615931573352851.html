LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, HON. LABOR ARBITER BIENVENIDO V. HERMOGENES &
INTERCONTINENTAL BROADCASTING CORPORATION (IBC), RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>GRIÑO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner was a driver of one of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">service </span>vehicles of the respondent International Broadcasting
Corporation (or IBC), receiving a salary of P1<span class="GramE">,162</span> per
month exclusive of allowances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to <st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1983</st1:date>,
he was found guilty of having circulated fake meal tickets in the company, acts
of dishonesty which should have caused his dismissal, but heeding his and his
union's pleas for clemency, the IBC decided to simply suspend him for thirty
(30) days effective <st1:date year="1983" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1983</st1:date>
or up to <st1:date year="1983" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1983</st1:date> (p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">88, Rollo).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, even before he could begin to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">serve his </span>penalty of suspension, he again committed an infraction
of company rules on March 31, 1983 when, according to the report of the
Motorpool Dispatcher, Reynaldo Demetillo, at eight o'clock in the morning <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>March 31, 1983, Maundy Thursday,
Ibarrientos took out the company's service vehicle, without Demetillo's
permission, and was out all day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
returned the motor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vehicle at </span><st1:time minute="15" hour="19"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">7:15 P.M.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
he was asked by Demetillo why he used the vehicle, he replied that he went to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> "for a personal trip in <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">visiting his relative </span>and had some
drinking spree the whole day there." He resented Demetillo’s questioning
him about his trip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"He burst into
anger," "was shouting mad with indecent words" and "made a
motion to assault" Demetillo and challenged him to a fistfight."
Fortunately, the guard </span>at the exit gate intervened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later in the evening, after the studio's
sign-off time, he refused to drive home the company nurse, Mrs. Purificacion
Cotoner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Security Manager
volunteered to have the nurse brought home by a security driver using another
vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, although he was
supposed to be on overtime duty up to 6:00 A.M. the next day, he took off that
same evening on his motorcycle, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so </span>that
Demetillo was "forced to stay for possible emergency operations within the
Networks" that night (pp. 86-87, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Demetillo’s report was corroborated by the Shift Security
Supervisor, Joven L. Pantoja.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 87, Rollo).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was ordered to submit a written explanation of the
following charges against him:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Abandonment of work.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Unauthorized use of company vehicle.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Drunkenness while on duty.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Insubordination.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Challenging his <st1:city><st1:place>Superior</st1:place></st1:city>
to a fistfight.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">After he had given his explanation, he
was discharged on <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He filed a complaint for illegal dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter, after hearing the parties, found:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"that there exist valid causes to impose
the penalty of dismissal on complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x x </span>We
also notice that persons having personal knowledge <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">of </span>the different charges raised by respondent against
complainant testified and affirmed the contents of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">their sworn testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
causes of dismissal must have been seen by the labor union to (sic) which
complainant is a member, as valid that it elected not to be heard on the matter
anymore." <span class="GramE">(p. 30, Rollo.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The dispositive portion of the Labor Arbiter's decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>Premises considered<span class="GramE">,</span> judgment is
hereby rendered dismissing the charge of illegal dismissal for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As regards the money claims, respondent is
hereby ordered to pay complainant his earned and worked for salary of P2<span class="GramE">,046.60</span> and overtime pay of P2,046.60 for March 1983, after
deducting the advances received from the Company and the loan from the provident
fund." <span class="GramE">(p. 31, Rollo.)</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, on appeal by both parties to the NLRC, the monetary
awards to Ibarrientos were set aside, but his dismissal was upheld (p. 32,
Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">After deliberating on the petition, the issues and arguments
raised by the parties, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no grave abuse of
discretion in the NLRC's <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">decision
dismissing </span>the complaint and setting aside the monetary award to the
petitioner, for there were just causes for his dismissal and that finding was
supported by substantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was accorded due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was notified of the charges against him
and given an opportunity to explain them in writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only after he had submitted his explanation
(evidently unsatisfactory from the point of view of his employer) did the IBC
decide to terminate his services.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:175.5pt">His money claims for unpaid salary of
P2<span class="GramE">,046.60</span> and overtime pay of P2,046.60 for March 1983
were properly dismissed for he admitted that his last monthly salary was only
P1,162.00, not P2,046.60.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His salary and
overtime pay for March 1983 amounted to P2<span class="GramE">,324.00</span>
only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since he was indebted to the
company for P1<span class="GramE">,879.90</span> which it advanced to pay his
income tax, and he had borrowed P1,021.40 from the provident fund (total:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>P2,901.30), there is nothing due him from the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, he still owes the company
P577.30.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">DISMISSED </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">for </span>lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the petitioner.</span></p>
