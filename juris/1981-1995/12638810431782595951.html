November 1988 of the Employees' Compensation Commission (ECC) which affirmed
the decision <span style="">of </span>the Government
Service Insurance System (GSIS) denying her claim for death benefits arising
out of the death of Rolando due to the absence of conclusive proof that he died
<span style="">of </span>cardio-pulmonary arrest
secondary to cerebro-vascular accident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual and procedural antecedents in this case are as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Rolando Quizon joined the Philippine Air Force on 30 June
1967.  He was assigned to the Southern
Command in Zamboanga City.  On 15
December 1981, he was promoted to the rank of Technical Sergeant and held such
position until his demise on 17 July 1986.  He had been on continuous active duty since his enlistment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Medical records show that on 15 July 1986 at around 9:00 o'clock
in the evening, due to his inability to speak, stand up or walk, Rolando was
brought by his fellow soldiers to the Regional Unified Command General Hospital
in Camp Navarro, Zamboanga City.  As
shown in the Clinical History prepared by the Medical Officer thereat, Maj.
Jose del Rosario, dated 23 July 1986, the following were the findings made, the
medicines given, and the course taken at the ward until Rolando died on 17 July
1986:</p>

<blockquote>"This is a case of Tsgt Rolando R. Quizon who was brought in
at this hospital by his fellow soldiers on 15 July 1986 at 2100H because of
inability to talk walk or stand up after they allegedly claimed the patient had
been drinking the night prior to this confinement.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">On </span><span style="">P.E. the patient is semi-unconscious with a
blood pressure of 110/70mm Hq EENT, pupils readed (sic) to light normally, not
dilated nor (sic) constricted.  Heart is
normal GUT-there is involuntary micturition.  Reflexes Knee jerk absent.  Plantan or </span>Babinoks reflex is hyperactive in both.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Medicines given or
ordered:  D5LR, Bemtex?CO2
inhalation and a close observation was done.  An indwelling catheter retained.  On 16th July 1986 Pen G. Sodium 3,000,000 "U" was started of 6
hrs I-V-T.T. ANST.  Anaroxyl and
Bipyrine in action were also administered, Constant follow-up of I-V-Fs using
Normosol -M Suction of throat and oral secretion was done.  </span>CBC &amp; Urinalysis were ordered.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Course </span>in <span style="">the Ward:  On 17th July 1986 at 0830H the patient developed severe coma with no

<p class="BODY">As stated in said history, the cause of death is <u>cardio-pulmonary</u>
<u>arrest</u> <u>secondary</u> <u>to</u> <u>cerebro-vascular</u> <u>accident</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a claim for payment <span style="">of </span>benefits with the GSIS.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> At
the back of the claim, Maj. del Rosario wrote in his <span style="">own </span>hand the clinical history, and on the space for diagnosis, he
made the following entry:  Cardio-Pulmonary arrest secondary to cerebro-vascular (CVA) accident.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a Summary of Finding and Recommendation evaluated and reviewed
on 21 October 1986, the Medical Services Center of the GSIS denied due course
to the claim "since there is no conclusive proof that the claimant died of
above illness," and that "there was not (sic) <span style="">ecg </span>done <span style="">to </span>the
claimant while he was still alive.  There was no history of hypertension, or any record of treatment or by
hospitalization for hypertension.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> The
"above illness" referred to is cardio-pulmonary arrest secondary to
CVA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed this denial to the ECC.  In its decision of 23 November 1988,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
ECC sustained the GSIS, holding:</p>

<blockquote>"We scrutinized the records of this case and uphold the
respondent's denial decision.  It is
very clear that appellant was apparently well as the records show that there
was no history that he was treated or hospitalized for hypertension, and no ECG
was done to prove the existence of a heart disease, hypertension or CVA, during
his stint as serviceman of the Philippine Air Force.  Without these proofs, this claim cannot be given due course.  The information given by his fellow soldiers
that the deceased has (sic) been drinking alcoholic drinks the night before his
confinement, <span style="">led </span>us to conclude
that the excessive intake of alcohol had aggravated the death of the former
soldier.  This claim therefore, does not
fall within the purview of P.D. 626, as amended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IN VIEW <span style="">THEREOF, </span>the
decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, and this instant case is dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review raising this lone issue:</p>

<blockquote>"WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT(S) COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF
DISCRETION IN HOLDING THAT THIS CLAIM DOES NOT FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF P.D.
626, AS AMENDED."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner argues </span>that
respondents' ruling to the effect that there was no substantial proof that
Rolando died of cerebro-vascular accident, an illness included in the List of
Occupational Diseases and thus compensable, is not supported by the records of
this case.  <span style="">On </span><span style="">the </span>contrary, <span style="">the Clinical History issued by the attending
government physician of the hospital where Rolando was confined and later died,
categorically stated that the cause of death was cardio-pulmonary arrest
secondary to cerebro-vascular accident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner further
contends that respondents' conclusion that Rolando's death </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">aggravated </span>by <span style="">excessive
intake of alcoholic drinks the night prior to his confinement is not supported
by evidence.  The Clinical History
prepared by Maj. del Rosario makes no observation that Rolando was indeed
drunk.  It does not indicate the
percentage of alcohol in the deceased's body to determine whether or not he was
intoxicated.  Respondents' only basis
for assuming the intoxication of the deceased was the allegation of his fellow
soldiers which was not even reduced into writing and, therefore, should not
have been taken into consideration in the absence of any medical examination
that would lead one to conclude that there was an excessive intake of alcohol.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Our Resolution of 12
February 1990, We required the respondents to comment on the petition.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the Comment filed on </span><span style="">6 </span><span style="">April 1990 for respondent ECC,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the Office of the Solicitor General argues
that although it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">true that death arising from cerebro-vascular
accident is among the occupational diseases included in Annex "A" of
the Amended Rules on Employees Compensation, compensation may be granted
subject to the following conditions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"a.    </span>There must be a history,
which should be proved, or trauma at work (to the head specially) due to
unusual and extra-ordinary physical or mental strain or event, or undue
exposure to noxious gases in industry.</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.  There must be a direct
connection between the trauma or exertion in the course of the employment and
the worker's collapse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>c.  If the trauma or
exertion then and there caused a brain hemorrhage, the injury may be considered
as arising from work."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent ECC submits that there <span style="">is </span>no showing in the records that the foregoing conditions
concur in the instant case, hence the claim for compensation must be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Our Resolution of 17 April 1991,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
We ordered the Comment of respondent GSIS expunged from the records for having
been filed out of time notwithstanding the numerous extensions given by this
Court, gave due course to the petition and required the parties to submit their
respective memoranda, which GSIS complied with on 7 May 1991<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and the petitioner on 24 May 1991.  Respondent ECC was allowed to adopt its Comment <span style="">as </span>its Memorandum.  In <span style="">its </span>Memorandum, the GSIS argues that n<span style="">o </span>reversible error was committed by
respondents since:  (1) Petitioner
failed to prove causal relation between the death of the deceased and his work
as technical sergeant in the Philippine Air Force.  Furthermore, she failed to show compliance with the conditions
for compensability set forth in the Implementing Rules.  (2) Payment of Petitioner's claim is
prohibited by Section 1, Rule IV of the Amended Rules on Employees'
Compensation which reads, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1. Limitation.
- <u>No</u> <u>compensation</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>allowed</u> <u>to</u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>employee</u> or his
dependents <u>when</u> <u>the</u> injury, sickness, disability or <u>death</u> <u>was</u>
<u>occasioned</u> <u>by</u> any of the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(1)  <u>his</u> </span><u>intoxication</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(2)  his willful </span>intention <span style="">to injure or kill himself or another; or<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(3)  his notorious negligence."
(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is quite clear that respondents have
adopted new theories to justify their respective prior actions.  When the case was at their level, they
denied the claim for reasons other than that which they now espouse before
Us.  GSIS disapproved the claim
primarily because "there is no conclusive proof that the claimant died of
the above illness" -- meaning cardio-pulmonary arrest secondary to
cerebro-vascular accident.  In upholding
the GSIS' denial, the ECC ruled, in effect, that for recovery of claims there
should be proof that there was a history that Rolando was treated or
hospitalized for hypertension, and that an ECG was done to prove the existence
of a heart disease, hypertension or CVA during his stint as serviceman of the
Philippine Air Force.  None was
offered.  Besides, the "excessive
intake of alcohol," as he had been drinking alcoholic drinks the night
before his confinement per information given by his fellow soldiers, had
aggravated his death.  Before Us,
however, the GSIS pursues a new tack:  denial of the claim because petitioner failed to prove the causal
relation between the death of Rolando and his work as Technical Sergeant of the
Philippine Air Force and show the compliance with the conditions for
compensability.  Moreover, it is alleged
that payment of the claim is prohibited by Section 1, Rule IV of the Amended
Rules aforesaid because of Rolando's intoxication.  On the other hand, ECC demands proof of concurrence of the
conditions for compensability of cerebro-vascular accident.</p>

<p class="BODY">If respondents GSIS and ECC had already in mind these theories at
the time they separately acted on the claim, they should have expressly asserted
them instead of treating the claim in a cavalier fashion, leaving the
petitioner at a loss as to why the death of her son, who had served his country
for nineteen (19) years, would be for naught.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the law,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> a
compensable sickness means any illness definitely accepted as an occupational
disease listed by the Commission, or any illness caused by employment subject
to proof that the risk of contracting the same is increased by the working
conditions.  Otherwise <span style="">stated, </span>for sickness and the resulting
death of an employee to be compensable, the claimant must show either:  (1) that it is a result of an occupational
disease listed under Annex "A" of the Amended Rules on Employees’
Compensation with the conditions set therein satisfied; or (2) if not so
listed, that the risk of contracting the disease is increased by the working
conditions.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, cerebro-vascular accident is an occupational disease
in Annex "A" of the Amended Rules.  In <span style="">such </span>a case, proof of causal
relation between the disease which resulted in Rolando's death and his work is <u>not</u>
necessary.  In <u>Rodriguez</u> <u>vs.</u>
<u>ECC</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
We ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"If the disease is listed in the Table of Occupational
Diseases embodied in Annex "A" of the Rules on Employees’ Compensation,
no proof of causation is required.  x x <span style="">x"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Abellara</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Secretary</u> <u>of</u> <u>labor</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
We held:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The new scheme of employees’ compensation establishes a
state insurance fund built up by the contributions of employers based on the
salaries of their employees and applies the social security principle in the
handling of workmen'<span style="">s </span>compensation.  The open ended Table of Occupational
Diseases requires no proof of causation.  x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>to be noted,
however, that although cerebro-vascular accident <span style="">is </span>a listed occupational disease, its compensability requires
compliance with all conditions set forth in the Rules, to wit:  (a) there must be a history, which should be
proved, of trauma at work (to the head specially) due to unusual and
extraordinary physical or mental strain or event, or undue exposure to noxious
gases <span style="">in </span>industry, (b) there <span style="">must </span>be a direct connection between
the trauma or exertion in the course <span style="">of
</span>the employment and the cerebro-vascular attack, and (c) the trauma or
exertion then and there caused a brain hemorrhage.  In short, cerebro-vascular accident is a <u>qualified</u>
occupational disease.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only substantial evidence <span style="">is
</span>required to prove the concurrence of the conditions.  This <span style="">is
</span>consistent with the liberal interpretation accorded the provisions of
the Labor Code and the social justice guarantee in favor of the workers.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
For, it is a well-settled rule that in carrying out and interpreting these
provisions of the Labor Code and its Implementing Rules, the workingman's
welfare should be the primordial and paramount consideration, and any doubt as
to its proper interpretation and application must be resolved in favor of the
employee whose rights must be protected.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing notwithstanding, where there is <span style="">no </span>compliance whatsoever with any of
the conditions set forth in the <span style="">Rules, </span>as
<span style="">in this </span>case, We cannot justify
a pronouncement of compensability.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, it is apparent from the records of the case that the
GSIS acted <span style="">on </span>the claim solely <span style="">on </span>the basis of the evaluation of the
clinical history prepared by Maj. del Rosario.  Petitioner was not given the opportunity to submit any other evidence or
be heard.  As earlier stated, the denial
was made in a very cavalier fashion.  There was undue haste in denying the claim.  Worse, despite an absence of credible basis, the GSIS and <span style="">ECC </span>have in effect, although
unintentionally, blackened the memory of Rolando by insinuating that excessive
intake of alcohol, or intoxication, as bluntly put by the GSIS in its
Memorandum, caused or aggravated his death.  This is a rather unfair attribution which Rolando can no longer rebut as
death has sealed his lips.  Petitioner
was deprived of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The demands of simple justice, taken in the light of the <span style="">compassionate </span>policy towards labor
which the 1987 Constitution vivifies and enhances,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
dictate that under the circumstances obtaining in this case, where it is shown
beyond cavil of doubt that Rolando did in fact die of cardio-pulmonary arrest
secondary to a cerebro-vascular accident, which is a listed occupational
disease, petitioner be allowed to present evidence to prove the concurrence of
the conditions for compensability of the subject disease.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered SETTING ASIDE the
Resolution <span style="">of </span>the GSIS denying
due course to the claim of petitioner and the challenged Decision of the
Employees Compensation Commission of 23 November 1988 in ECC Case No. 3365, and
