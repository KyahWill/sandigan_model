previous offer of compromise in a letter dated <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1971</st1:date> which was refused by the complainant
Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="8">August
 9, 1971</st1:date>, accused Cesar <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> pleaded not
guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background of the case as found by the trial court and
the Court of Appeals are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence shows that the accused (peti­tioner
herein) was employed by the complainant Philippine Refining Company (PRC for
short), for a period of about three years, that is, from 1967 to March 1970, first
as junior merchandiser and later as its distribution salesman for the <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> region comprising the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
salesman, he received merchandise manufactured by the PRC, such as beauty and
laundry soap, cooking oil, etc. for sale to different end-users of said
products in his area on cash basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
merchandise are first stored in PRC warehouse in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
then later withdrawn from said warehouse and delivered to the accused through
David Trucking Company, <span class="SpellE">PRC's</span> authorized hauler of
goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The delivery of the goods was
covered by Ex?Warehouse Stock Transfer Receipts signed by the accused
(herein petitioner) in triplicate:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the
white copy (original) is sent by the salesman (accused) to the main office of
PRC in Manila; the green one, for the salesman-accused (petitioner herein) as
his copy and the blue copy is re­tained by the trucking company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused acknowledges receipt of such
deliveries in the daily salesman's Activity Report which the accused is required
to send to the Manila Central Office of PRC regularly.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1969</st1:date>,
David Trucking Company delivered PRC goods in the amount of P13,200.00 to the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused received said goods
from <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonto</span> of David
Trucking Company as evidenced by Ex-Warehouse Stock Transfer Receipt No.
119160.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1970</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Bonto</span> again
deli­vered PRC stocks amounting to P13,825.50 to the accused as shown in
Ex-Warehouse Stock Transfer Receipt No. 119200.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again on <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1970</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Bonto</span> made another delivery of PRC products to the
accused in the sum total of P13,509.75 and the latter received the goods in
perfect condition as appearing in Ex-Warehouse Receipt No. 119241.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Cesar <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> failed to send to
Manila the signed original of Ex-Warehouse Stock Transfer Receipt No. 119160,
No. 119200 and 119241 covering merchandise with an aggregate value of
P40,534.75 and did not include acknowledgment of receipt of said merchandise in
his Salesman's Activity Report, thereby the Manila Office of PRC wired Gil
Casanova, its Divisional Sales Manager for the <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span>
Region in 1969-1970 to make a physical inventory of the stocks in the
possession of the accused on February 18, 1970 and to render his Inventory
Report immediately after completion of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramon <span class="SpellE">Gascon</span>, the
District Sales Manager of PRC for the <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> Region
effected an inventory of the stock then in the possession of the, accused and
accordingly rendered his inventory Report.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Based on this inventory, a stock Reconciliation Statement and Sche­dule
of Stock accountability was prepared by the <span class="SpellE">PRC's</span>
Accounting Supervisor <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>
covering the period <st1:date year="1969" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1969</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1970</st1:date> and
Schedules of Stock Accountability of the accused for said period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It turned out that accused was short in
stocks in the amount of P50,586.49.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused was informed of his shortage in a letter dated <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accused then went to see General Sales Manager, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>
in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> and offered to settle his
obligation by paying P10,000.00 down payment and a monthly installment of
P500.00 until full payment of his total accountability, which was not accepted
by the Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> evidence
is summarized by the lower court and incorporated in the Court of Appeals
decision, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused took the witness stand in his own defense and
testified that his stocks shortage was limited to merchandise worth around
P10,000.00, repre­senting PRC products he sold on credit to two valued
customers, which sale he did not report in his Salesman's Activity Report
because only cash sale was allowed by PRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He explained his violation of the company rule against sale on credit in
his testimony in open court, the per­tinent parts of which read as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Let us come to the so-called accounts
receivable that you still have and which you in­formed the Hon. Court accounts
for the shortage amounting to P10,051.74.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These accounts receivable, do you have any docu­ments pertaining to
those ac­counts receivable?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And you stated here that there were two
stores which more or less bought those goods amount­ing to P10,051.74 which you
have not been able to collect up to the time you were separated from Philippine
Refining Company?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you inform Philippine Refin­ing Company
about this matter?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
did not inform the company because it is prohibited for us to sell on credit,
and we only prepare the sales invoices when the goods were paid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you said it is prohibited for you to sell goods on credit, did you violate any regulation
of Phi­lippine Refining Company regard­ing your duties as a salesman?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
admit that I violated some regulations of Philippine Refining Company but the
reason for the viola­tion was because of my desire to meet the quota.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
because of that violation you would be responsible for the accounts receivable?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span> (pp. 31-32, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
<st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="2">Feb. 21, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In connection with his receivable in the amount of
P10,051.74, the evidence shows that two customers, namely, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Bailon</span> and Leonardo Lee, acknowledged in writing on August
7, 1973 that they did purchase on credit through the now accused Distribution
Salesman Cesar <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> of the PRC between the period
October, 1969 and February, 1970, PRC merchandise in the amount of P6,500.00
and P3,551.75, respective­ly, and to maintain their credit standing as
businessman they remitted said amounts on August 7, 1973 to the PRC, their
remittance totaling P10,051.75 receipt of which amount was on August 23, 1973
issued in favor of the accused Cesar <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> ‘For Deposit
Only' (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 5, 6 and 7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Regarding alleged shortage represent­ing the purported
transfer to the accused of P40,534.75 worth of PRC products, from its <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Warehouse, covered by the hauler's copies of
Ex-Warehouse stock Transfer Receipts and that consequently, he did not and
could not send to the PRC Manila Office the original copies of said
Ex-Warehouse stock Transfer Receipts along with his Salesman's Activity Report
for the day:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>said PRC products were allegedly
delivered to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He denies the initials,
lines or <span class="SpellE">scrawlings</span> appearing below and above the
words 'Received By: Salesman' on the hauler’s copy of said Ex-Warehouse Stock
Trans­fer Receipts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this connection, the accused further testified that
according to the standard opera­ting procedure followed by PRC in the delive­ries
of PRC products from its <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Warehouse to the
accused and its distribution salesman five (5) copies of the Ex-Warehouse Stock
Transfer Receipt are prepared:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>2 copies
being retained by the <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Warehouse; and 3 copies
by the Hauler who in turn have them signed by the receiving Salesman between
the lines on which is printed 'Received by Salesman' in this case by the
accused, and upon actual delivery to and receipt of said products by the
Salesman, the white original and the green copy of said Ex-Warehouse Stock
Transfer Receipt are delivered to the salesman who received said products, and
the blue copy is retained by the hauler.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Salesman, in turn, sends the white original, along with his
Salesman's Activity Report, to the PRC Manila Office, retaining the yellow copy
for his file.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even on cross-examination
the accused was clear on this SOP:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
the David Trucking Hauler delivers goods to you, what does the hauler ask of
you?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What does he require when you receive
the goods?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Every
time the David trucking delivers goods, they carry with them three copies of
the Ex-Ware­house Stock Transfer, and when I receive the goods, I sign the
receipt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
according to you, from the signing of the receipt, because you have received
the goods al­ready, the blue copy is given to the hauler?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
who keeps the green copy?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I,
and the white copy is being mailed to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
according to you, you mailed the white copy the next day toge­ther with the
Salesman Activity Report known as SAR, together with the bank draft?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, with the sales invoice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
that every delivery made to you by the hauler, there are, as you said, three copies
of the Ex-Ware- house Stock Transfer prepared, white, blue and green?</blockquote>

I ask, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, do you have any of the green
copies of Exhi­bits B, C, and D?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
can I have the green copies when I did not receive those goods.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
also the white copies?</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING THE
DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT ON THE BASIS OF INCOMPETENT/INADMISSIBLE AND
LEGALLY INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II.</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT
ACQUITTING PETITIONER OF THE CRIME IMPUTED TO HIM UPON THE GROUND OF REASONABLE
DOUBT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 114)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The primordial issue of this case is whether or not the Court of
Appeals acted with grave abuse of discretion in affirming the decision of the
trial court on the basis of alleged incompetent/inadmissible and legally
insufficient evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a generally accepted principle that only questions of law
and not factual issues, may be raised in the Supreme Court and that factual
findings of the Court of Appeals are final and may not be reviewed on appeal to
this Court, (Sec. 2, second. par., Rule 45; <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> vs.
Court of Appeals, 147 SCRA 236 /1987/; Moran vs. Court of Appeals, 133 SCRA 83
/1984/; Collector of Customs vs. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA 3/1985/; <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA 50 /1985/; Premier
Insurance &amp; Surety Corp. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al., 141 SCRA
423 /1986/; Director of Lands vs. <span class="SpellE">Funtillar</span>, 142 SCRA
57 /1986/; Republic vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 144 SCRA 705 /1986/);
unless:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) the conclusion is grounded
entirely on speculation, surmises and conjectures; 2) the inference is
manifestly mistaken, absurd and impossible; 3) there is grave abuse of
discretion; 4) the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; 5) the
court, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case, and the same
are contrary to the admission of both the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>;
6) the findings of the Appellate Court are contrary to those of the trial
court; and 7) the findings are without citation of specific evidence on which
they are based.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>
vs. Court of Appeals, 147 SCRA 236 /1987/; <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
vs. de Jesus, 56 SCRA 167/1974; Carolina Industries, Inc. vs. CMS Stock
Brokerage, Inc., et al., 97 SCRA 734 /1980/; <span class="SpellE">Manero</span>
vs. Court of Appeals, 102 SCRA 817 /1981/; Moran Jr. vs. Court of Appeals,
supra; <span class="SpellE">Sacay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
142 SCRA 593 /1986/; Director of Lands vs. <span class="SpellE">Funtillar</span>,
et al. supra.)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is herein petitioner's contention that his case falls under
one of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> exception, more particu­larly,
that the Court's findings are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises and
conjectures and such conclusion of facts were made with abuse of discretion by
reason of the total lack of competent and/or admissible evidence in support
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of this contention, petitioner in his assignment of
error claims that the Ex-warehouse Stock Transfer Receipt Exhibits B, C &amp; D
are not competent proof to show his receipt of goods since the signature
appearing in the Exhibits B &amp; C are not his, while Exhibit D does not bear
any signature at all (Petitioner's Brief, p. 11).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this contention was rebutted by the
evidence pre­sented by the prosecution consisting of the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonto</span> who stated that it
was the petitioner who actually received said items described in Exhibit B, C
and D and thereafter who actually signed the Ex-Warehouse Transfer Receipts in <span class="SpellE">Bonto's</span> presence (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 6-15,
May 24, 1972) and that he delivered the goods by Ex-Warehouse Receipt, Exhibit
B, C and D to petitioner on December 2, 1969, January 12, 1970, February 3,
1970 (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 6-14, May 24, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being no showing that <span class="SpellE">Bonto</span> has any reason to testify falsely against the
accused, the latter's assertion that he did not receive the goods nor sign the
receipt merits no consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a
well-settled rule that mere denial of an accused cannot prevail over the clear
and positive testimony of the prosecution witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Parilla</span>,
144 SCRA 454 /1986/).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, petitioner claims, that <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bonto</span> testi­fied not on petitioner's receipt of the
goods in question but on the latter's receipt of previous deliveries and
includes that <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonto's</span>
testimony has no probative value and insufficient to support petitioner's
conviction of the crime imputed to him (Petitioner's Brief, pp. 13­-14).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's contention is unmeritorious,
having been belied by <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonto's</span>
testimony that he personally delivered the goods covered by Ex-Warehouse Stock
Transfer Receipts Exhibits B, C and D to petitioner himself on their different
dates, namely, December 2, 1969, January 12, 1970 and February 3, 1970 and for
every delivery, petitioner signed the corresponding receipt in <span class="SpellE">Bonto's</span> presence (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span> pp.6-15,
May 24, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As has been aptly stated
by the Court of Appeals in its decision "(T)he credibility of witness <span class="SpellE">Bonto</span> was never impugned by the defense nor was there shown
any ill motive on the part of <span class="SpellE">Bonto</span> to testify
falsely against appellant." (Court of Appeals decision p. 13, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 56).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well
settled is the rule that witnes­ses who have no evil motive to testify against
the accused are credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People vs.
Beltran, 133 SCRA 521 /1985/).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Bonto's</span> testimony regarding petitioner's receipt of the
goods in question cannot be doubted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner’s offer to settle his obligation with PRC is
indeed an implied admission of guilt on his part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 24, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of
Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner however, contends that his offer of compro­mise
contained in his letter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "2") did not
mention how much he is liable to PRC, and hence, cannot be said to have
admitted liability on all the goods covered by the Ex-Warehouse Stock Transfer
Receipt Exhibits B, C and D.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Petitioner's Brief, p. 16).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
asserts that his letter is not strictly a definite offer of compromise within
the provision of Sec. 24, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such contention lacks merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It must be remembered that the information for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
against petitioner was filed on <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1971</st1:date> whereas, his offer of compromise was made on <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1971</st1:date>, or thirteen (13)
days after the information against him was docketed in the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, it can be inferred from his act that
when he execu­ted his offer of compromise, he was already fully aware of the amount
imputed to him by PRC and that he was offering to settle the case against him
involving stock shortage in the total amount of P50,719.37 worth of PRC
products.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As consistently ruled by this
Court, an offer of compromise by the accused in criminal cases is an implied
admission of guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Torres, 34 Phil. 994; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sope</span>, 75 Phil.
810; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>, 37 SCRA 813 /1971/).</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, petitioner's failure to account for the whereabouts
of the missing PRC products or the proceeds of the sale thereof constituted
circumstantial evidence of misappropriation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records, We find no cogent reason
to disturb the findings of fact and of law by respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is Denied and the decision of respondent
Court of Appeals is Affirmed <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u>.</p>
