				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For resolution before this Court is the appeal interposed by Dominador
Villarin, accused-appellant for "Rape" under Criminal Case No.
1736.  Villarin was sentenced by
Honorable Roque A. Agton of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 6, Mati, Davao
Oriental, to a prison term of "Reclusion Perpetua; to indemnify the offended
party in the sum of P12,000.00 in the concept of moral damages and attorney's
fee in the sum of P5,000.00; and to pay the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Information charging the accused-appellant for the crime,
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned, at the instance of the offended party,
accuses DOMINADOR VILLARIN of the crime of RAPE, defined and penalized under
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'That on or about the first week of December 1987, in the
Municipality of Mati, Province of Davao Oriental, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of
force, violence and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously have carnal knowledge with one CARIDAD VILLADAR, against her
will.'" (Rollo, p. 30)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the
crime charged.  (Ibid., p. 30)</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonial evidence for the prosecution included Dra.
Liwayway M. Lao who testified that as a resident physician of the Davao Oriental
Provincial Hospital, Mati, Davao Oriental, she examined on June 30, 1988,
Caridad Villadar, 28 years old, and found that Caridad Villadar was seven (7)
months pregnant as indicated in Exhibit "A".  Ms. Villadar was likewise x-rayed and the
result was introduced as Exhibit "B".  (Rollo, p. 31)</p>

<p class="BODY">Adelina Apares testified that she is a local midwife and a
resident of Tagamot, Dawan, Mati, Davao Oriental, and that on October 4, 1988,
at about 2:00 o'clock in the morning, she assisted Ms. Villadar in delivering
her baby daughter, who was named Maricel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Editha Mapa was presented and testified that she is a purok
leader of Tagamot, Dawan, Mati, Davao Oriental for 27 years.  On June 28, 1988, she received a complaint
that the latter was on the family way and was allegedly raped by Dominador
Villarin.  (Ibid., pp. 31­-32)</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the complaint, Mrs. Mapa summoned the accused and
his father.  Sotero Villarin, the
accused's father appeared, but the accused failed to honor the invitation.  During the conference, Sotero Villarin
proposed marriage of his son to private complainant Caridad Villadar, but
unfortunately her mother, Esperanza Villadar, pushed for the filing of the case
before the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 29, 1988, the mother, accompanied by her daughter, lodged
a complaint before the police station, asserting that her daughter was raped by
the accused.  This complaint was entered
in the police blotter and an invitation was issued to the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused and his father appeared before the police
investigation officer on July 4, 1988, and in the course of the confrontation,
the accused admitted having carnal knowledge with the victim and proposed to
marry her.  The parents of the victim,
however, vehemently declined the proposal and instead insisted on filing the
case in court.  (Ibid., p. 32)</p>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. Fortunato Libres testified that as a member of the INP of
the Mati Police Station, Mati, Davao Oriental, he was assigned to serve a
subpoena and a complaint by the Provincial Fiscal's Office for several times to
the accused, whom he could not contact at his residence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undaunted, he tried and on the first week of August 1988, while
armed with a warrant of arrest he went to Bunawan, Agusan del Sur, where the
accused was believed to be working.  For
three (3) times, he failed to contact him.  However, on December 15, 1988, he was able to serve the warrant on the
accused whom he brought to the Mati Police Station.  (Ibid., p. 33)</p>

<p class="BODY">Esperanza Villadar, mother of the victim, testified that she
noticed her daughter, Caridad's abdomen bulging on June 20, 1988, thus she
brought the latter to the Davao Oriental Provincial Hospital for
examination.  Dra. Lao examined Caridad
and informed Esperanza, that her daughter was pregnant.  An x-ray picture was taken and it confirmed
the examination of the doctor who diagnosed Caridad to be seven months
pregnant.</p>

<p class="BODY">When confronted, the victim informed her mother that she was
raped by the accused on the first week of December, 1987, while she was on her
way home after gathering bamboo shoots on their land.  (Ibid., p. 33)</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 28, 1988, Esperanza again reported the pregnancy of
Caridad to the Purok Leader/President of Tagamot, Dawan, Mati, Davao
Oriental.  Mrs. Editha Mapa,
subsequently, reported the same incident to Sgt. Luciano of the Mati Police
Station.  (Ibid., p. 34)</p>

<p class="BODY">Caridad Villadar, 30 years of age, single and a resident of
Tagamot, Dawan, Mati, Davao Oriental took the witness stand and testified that
on the first week of December 1987; she was told by her mother to gather bamboo
shoots in their farm which is about one (1) kilometer away from their
house.  She brought with her the sack
and a bolo for cutting the bamboo shoots.  While on her way home carrying about half a sack full of bamboo shoots,
the accused grabbed the bolo from her and threw it away.  The accused boxed her thighs, forced her to
lie down, and abused her.  When his
bestial desire was consummated, the accused told her not to tell her mother or
else, she will be killed and then left immediately.  She returned home without informing her mother about the
incident.  (Ibid., pp. 34-35)</p>

<p class="BODY">At 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon on October 4, 1988, Caridad gave
birth to a baby girl whom she named Maricel Villadar.  (Ibid., p. 36)</p>

<p class="BODY">For the defense, three witnesses took the stand, the accused
Dominador Villarin, Esperidion Burgos and Romeo Carmelotes.  (Ibid., p. 36)</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused vehemently denied the accusation of the complainant
and claimed that they are sweethearts.  He also asserted that they had several sexual intercourses in the house
of the accused and that in all these encounters, the complainant wholeheartedly
consented.  The relationship started in
June 1986, when the accused allegedly first visited the victim in her house and
proposed his love to her and on the same month, his proposal was accepted.  Subsequently, he deflowered Caridad and this
resulted in a lovers' intimacy which was repeated several times.  (Ibid., pp. 37-38)</p>

<p class="BODY">Esperidion Burgos, neighbor of the accused and the complainant,
testified that every Saturday and Sunday, he used to visit his friend, accused
Villarin.  On one occasion, the accused
told him that Caridad is his sweetheart and when he met her in the poblacion of
Tagamot, the latter confirmed the relationship she had with the accused.  He also disclosed that he saw on several
occasions, the accused and Caridad embracing each other at the residence of the
accused which is about 50 meters away from the residence of the
complainant.  (Ibid., pp. 36-37)</p>

<p class="BODY">Romeo Carmelotes on the other hand, testified that he has seen Caridad
in the house of Villarin many times since he often leaves in the house of the
latter, farm produce that he purchased in the area such as mangoes, jackfruits,
bananas, lemonsito, oranges and eggs.  He asserted that he saw on several occasions Caridad and the accused,
embracing each other.  (TSN, pp. 12-13,
April 2, 1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question left for this Court to resolve given the facts
re-stated above which were culled from the testimonies of the witnesses for
both the prosecution and the defense, is whether or not accused committed the
offense charged.  This Court notes the
statement of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon close perusal of the facts at issue, both parties are
locked in conflicting versions.  The
victim charged the accused for allegedly raping her in the first week of
December, 1987, however, the accusation was vehemently denied by the accused
and claimed that the victim is his sweetheart." (Rollo, pp. 37-38)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the review made of the testimonies of the principal protagonists,
the complainant herself, her apparently over-anxious mother, Esperanza Villadar
and the accused Dominador Villarin and his witnesses, corroborated the finding
of the trial court that the versions of the parties are not only conflicting,
but they are inconsistent, incongruous, incoherent and contradictory with each
other on vital and material points.  Some doubt as to the veracity of the tales given by Caridad and her
mother is engendered.  On the basis of
the records, the testimonies of Esperanza and Caridad Villadar could easily
have been rehearsed since they are not first-hand recitals of facts and
circumstances and they lack a certain element of spontaniety.  The discovery of the pregnancy came on the
seventh month of the fetal life of the fruit of the coital relationship between
the accused and Caridad.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pregnancy is an after-the-fact condition of the liaison between
two persons of different sexes.  Whether
the pregnancy is the result of pleasurable or forced sexual intimacy is the
duty of the court to determine from the given facts and circumstances that are
not contrary to human nature and experience.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that both Caridad Villadar and Dominador Villarin are of
marriageable ages, both being 28 years old at the time of the incident and without
any impediment to get married and the allegation that they would have lived a
peaceful and blissful life of their own if the vehement objection of Esperanza
Villadar did not stop them from doing so, is worth looking into to establish
whether or not the incident was indictable or it was a pure and simple amorous
relationship between two lovers.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are other facts susceptible of two interpretations - one
supporting a finding of innocence and the other indicating the opposite.  There are also contradictory statements:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The meeting of the accused and Caridad appears to have been
planned and was not by chance, considering the testimony of Esperanza Villadar
that the house of the accused is situated closer to the road, such that when
they have to go to the road, they pass by the house of the Villarins.  Mrs. Villadar testified with respect to this
matter on cross-examination made by the Court and the counsel for the defense,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;">"COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q -</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A  -</span><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span> </span>Before they were staying in the
upper portion and they transferred to the lower portion, we are
neighbors." (TSN - Jan. 15, 1990, p. 99)</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote style="font-weight: bold;">ATTY. DIUYAN:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q -</span><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; </span>How
far is the house of Sotero Villarin to your house?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A  -</span><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span> </span>Not far because we used to pass
by their house and on my way going to the road.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q -</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can
you estimate how far?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A -</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
50 meters.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q -</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
your house is situated at the upper portion of the area?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A  -</span><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span> </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q -</span><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; </span>And
the house of Sotero Villarin is below?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A -</span><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q -</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
these two houses is (sic) located in the hilly portion?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A -</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">Q -</span><span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; </span>And
wherever (sic) you come down the road you pass by the house of Villarin?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-weight: bold;">A -</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes."
(TSN - Jan. 15, 1990, pp. 99-100)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the above, it can be argued that the appellant was on the
watch for Caridad to pass by and followed her on that fateful day.  More likely, however, is that there was a
rendezvous between two lovers, for considering that Caridad may have been asked
to gather bamboo shoots, how would the accused know where she would go and what
time, if she did not tip off the latter?  More important, as Caridad was to gather bamboo shoots, she would not be
passing by the house of the accused to go to the forest where the bamboo grove
grows because from the declaration of Esperanza above, they pass by the house
of the accused in going to the road.  This shows that the house of the accused is on the opposite direction if
one is to go to the forest to gather bamboo shoots.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The declarations of the private complainant negate her
accusation that she was raped, because while she alleged that she lost
consciousness, she knew the details surrounding the act complained of as in the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">4. The filing of the complaint against the accused can be
subjected to various explanations.  The
appellant claims that it was filed not to seek justice but to explain a
pregnancy during an unmarried state.  The accused had left the place and from all indications he may have
abandoned the woman he impregnated.  The
rape drama is equally susceptible to a finding that it portrays what really
happened or that it is a mere cover-up of an amorous relationship between the
accused and Caridad who was prevailed upon by her parents to cooperate with
them after the accused hid himself from their view.  It may also be possible that the accused miscalculated the
actuations of Caridad and her mother.  The following testimonies support this point:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of this review, the Court noted the insistence of
the accused in asserting what could be the true antecedents surrounding the
alleged rape, including the hope that their indiscretion, might bring about the
consent of Caridad's parents.  The indiscretion
was a miscalculated move on his part, for instead of allowing the couple to
settle down for good, the mother saw to it that a charge of rape be levelled
against the accused.</p>

have been concerned, she was silent and apathetic leaving everything to her
mother who was persistent and assertive:</p>
