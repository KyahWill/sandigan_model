				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY"> It is a settled rule in this jurisdiction that the conviction of the accused, who is constitutionally presumed innocent, depends upon the strength of the prosecution and not the weakness of the defense. Unfortunately for the accused in this case, his prosecution for murder with assault upon a person in authority, undoubtedly already strong, was made even stronger by the defense itself.<br><br>As the trial court<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> which convicted him saw it, the crime imputed to Napoleon Montealegre was committed as follows:<br><br>At about 11:30 in the evening of March 11, 1983, while Edmundo Abadilla was eating at the Meding's Restaurant in Cavite City, he detected the smell of <i>marijuana</i> smoke coming from a nearby table. Intending to call a policeman, he quietly went outside and saw Pfc. Renato Comantigue in his car whom he hailed to report the matter. After parking his vehicle Camantigue joined Abadilla in the restaurant and soon thereafter the two smelled marijuana smoke from the table occupied by Vicente Capalad and the accused-appellant. Camantigue then approached the two and collared both of them, saying "<i>Nagmamarijuana kayo, ano?</i>" Forcing them up, he asked the waitress if she know them but the waitress said she did not.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Then the mayhem began.<br><br>While Camantigue was holding the two, Montealgere with his right hand and Capalad with his left hand, Capalad suddenly and surreptitiously pulled out a knife from a scabbard tucked in the right side of his waist and started stabbing Camantigue in the back.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Camantigue let loose Montealegre to draw the gun from his holster but Montealegre, thus released, restrained Camantigue's hand to prevent the latter from defending himself. Montealegre used both his hands for this purpose,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> as Capalad continued stabbing the victim.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> While they were thus grappling, the three fell to the floor and Capalad, freed from Camantigue's grip, rose and scampered toward the door. Camantigue fired and, continuing the pursuit outside, fired again.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Capalad fled into a dark alley. Camantigue abandoned the chase and asked to be brought to a hospital. Capalad was later found slumped in the alley with a bullet wound in his chest. Neither Camantigue nor Capalad survived, both expiring the following day.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant, for his part, escaped during the confusion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Having been informed of the incident, Capt. Cipriano Gilera of the Cavite police immediately organized a team that went to look for him that very night.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> They did not find him in his house then but he was apprehended in the morning of March 12, 1983, on board a vehicle bound for Baclaran. He gave his name as Alegre but later admitted he was the fugitive being sought.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Dr. Regalado Sosa, reporting on the autopsy of the Camantigue's body, testified that death was caused by severe shock due to massive internal hemorrhage caused by seven stab wounds affecting the heart, lungs, liver, stomach, pancreas, and diaphragm.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; The weapon used was 6" in length and about 2 to 2.5 cm. in width and the blood found on it was analyzed as human.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The stabbing incident was narrated in detail at the trial by Abadilla,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> who was corroborated by Generoso San Juan.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>On direct examination, Abadilla testified that Montealegre prevented Camantigue from drawing his pistol while he was being stabbed by Capalad, demonstrating with the aid of court personnel the relative positions of the three during the incident.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>On cross-examination, he reiterated his previous declaration even more emphatically, thus:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q. </td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">When accused Montealegre hold the hand of Pfc.

He claimed he ran away before the stabbing but his testimony, consisting of denials, evasions, contradictions, claims of ignorance arid forgetfulness and protestations of innocence, does not have the ring of truth. The following excerpts are reflective of the kind of defense he offered to exculpate himself from the charge established against him by the prosecution:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">Q.</td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Now, while Pfc.

As one of the principal figures of the stabbing incident, he could not have not known, nor could he later not remember, that startling event that even mere onlookers could not forget. The evidence has established that the accused-appellant was directly and personally involved and was in fact one of the two persons held by the victim when he was stabbed. Yet Montealegre would now insist, quite incredibly, that he was unaware of what had transpired that night.<br><br>If it is true, as he says, that he ran away before the stabbing, there would have been less likelihood of Capalad's attack as Camantigue's attention would have been fully concentrated on his lone captive. Moreover, there would have been nothing to restrain the policeman from drawing his pistol and defending himself against Capalad if the accused-appellant had, by his own account, already escaped before the stabbing.<br><br>It is also worth noting that, instead of reporting to the authorities, what the accused-appellant did was attempt to hide, only to be found the following morning on board a bus bound for outside Cavite City. When apprehended, he first gave a false name before he finally admitted his identity, thus beginning the mesh of contradictions, admissions and denials, in which he would ensnare himself.<br><br>The Court accepts the evidence established by the prosecution that at the time of the stabbing, the victim was in uniform and. therefore, could easily be recognized as a person in authority. Several witnesses testified as to his attire when he was killed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> And even assuming that the victim was in civilian clothes on that tragic night, the record shows that no less than the accused-appellant himself, replying to questions put to him by the prosecution, declared twice that he knew the victim to be a policeman.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant was correctly considered a co-principal for having collaborated with Capalad in the killing of the police officer. The two acted in concert, with Capalad actually stabbing Camantigue seven times and the accused-appellant holding on to the victim's hands to prevent him from drawing his pistol and defending himself. While it is true that the accused-appellant did not himself commit the act of stabbing, he was nonetheless equally guilty thereof for having prevented Camantigue from resisting the attack against him. The accused-appellant was a principal by indispensable cooperation under Article 17, par. 3, of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>AS correctly interpreted, the requisites of this provision are: "(1) participating in the criminal resolution, that is, there is either anterior conspiracy or unity of criminal purpose and intention immediately before the commission of the crime charged; and (2) cooperation in the commission of the offense by performing another act without which it would not have been accomplished."<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The prosecution contends that although there was no evidence of a prior agreement between Capalad and Montealegre, their subsequent acts should prove the presence of such conspiracy. The Court sustains this view, which conforms to our consistent holding on this matter:<br><blockquote>"Conspiracy need not be established by direct proof as it can be inferred from the acts of the appellants.

It can be safely assumed that had not appellant held both arms of the victim from behind, the latter could have parried the thrust or even run away from his assailant.

Accordingly, he must suffer the penalty imposed upon him, to wit, <i>reclusion perpetua,</i> there being no aggravating and mitigating circumstances, plus the civil indemnity, which is hereby increased to P30,000.00, and the actual, medical and funeral expenses in the sum of P37,380.00 as proved at the trial.<br><br>Pfc. Renato Camantigue was only 34 years old when he died in line of duty while enforcing the law against the abuse of dangerous drugs. He was struck down with no less than seven vicious stabs by a man who, by his own admission, was at the time of the incident "burned" on marijuana. The killer also eventually succumbed, and that, made the second life needlessly lost to the wickedness of drug addiction. There was another life also ruined, this time of the 28 year-old accused-appellant himself, although, fortunately for him, his loss is not irretrievable nor is his future forever foreclosed. In the somber shadows of the prison bars, as he ponders the wrong he has done, he may yet find his ultimate redemption in rehabilitation and remorse.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED as above modified, without any pronouncement as to costs.
