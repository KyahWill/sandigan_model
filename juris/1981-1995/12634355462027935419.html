Rules of Court, from the consolidated decision of the Court of Appeals in
AC-G.R. No. 64077-CV, entitled “Massive Construction Inc. v. Jaime C. Uy,” and
AC-G.R. No. 65234-CV, entitled “Jaime Uy v. Enrique P. Syquia, et al.”</p>

<p class="BODY">In AC-G.R. No. 64077-CV, the Court of Appeals reversed the
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 87006,
which ordered defendant Jaime C. Uy (UY for brevity) to pay plaintiff Massive
Construction, Inc. (MASSIVE for brevity) a sum of money for unrealized profits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">resulting
from UY’s violation of the Agreement dated December 16, 1971 (AGREEMENT for
brevity), attorney’s fees and cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In AC-G.R. No. 65234-CV, the Court of Appeals reversed the
decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 87511,
which declared the AGREEMENT as rescinded due to the breach thereof by both UY
and defendants Enrique Syquia, et al. (stockholders of MASSIVE).</p>

<p class="BODY">The two cases arose from a common background.</p>

<p class="BODY">MASSIVE was engaged in the construction business in the Greater
Manila Area while UY was connected with Super Highway Lumber and Construction
Supply, Inc. (SUPER HIGHWAY for brevity), a business run by his wife and
engaged in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">business of supplying construction materials.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the latter part of 1971, MASSIVE suffered financial reverses,
resulting in its corporate reorganization.  Ramon P. Syquia, the general manager of MASSIVE, asked his relatives to
help bail out the company from its financial difficulties.  Enrique P. Syquia, Jose Ma. Mendieta, Jaime
Sta. Maria, and Jesus P. Syquia were thus elected directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of operation, MASSIVE became indebted to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">SUPER HIGHWAY </span>for purchases of
construction materials in an amount exceeding P100,000.00.  In order to settle this obligation,
negotiations were started between the stockholders of MASSIVE on one hand and
UY on the other.  After several
meetings, the parties signed on 16 December 1972 their AGREEMENT, particularly
entered into by and among JAIME C. UY as First Party, RAMON P. SYQUIA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>Second Party, and JOSE MA.
MENDIETA, JAIME STA. MARIA, ROMEO ALMARIO, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Mendieta signing his CONFORME in behalf of
MASSIVE, the pertinent terms of which follow:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the SECOND PARTY and the THIRD PARTY
are the complete stockholders and directors of MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION, INC., a
corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines;</blockquote>

the entire shares of stock of said corporation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the FIRST PARTY, SECOND PARTY and
THIRD PARTY have agreed that the FIRST PARTY will purchase the entire shares of

the following terms and conditions:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">‘a)  That the FIRST PARTY will pay to the SECOND

constitute as down payment after the FIRST PARTY complies with this Agreement,
but which will be forfeited in favor of the SECOND and THIRD PARTY in case of
failure to comply with this Agreement;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">‘b)  That aside from the P20,000.00 earnest
money, the FIRST PARTY will pay P30,000.00 on or before January 5, 1973 and the
balance of P200,000.00 shall be paid in monthly installments of P50,000.00
every 5th day of the month thereafter until the entire amount of P250,000.00 is

collections; and the corporation has also a pending obligation with the FIRST
PARTY; and all parties agree that from this date, 50% of the receivable
collected and 30% of the collections received by the corporation shall be
applied to the balance of P230,000.00 owing from the FIRST PARTY to the SECOND
and THIRD PARTY; and these amounts, in turn, shall be paid by the FIRST PARTY
to the corporation by the reduction and partial payment of the obligation of
the corporation to the FIRST PARTY;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">‘d)  That upon payment of the FIRST PARTY of
P20,000.00 to the SECOND and THIRD PARTY, the SECOND and THIRD PARTY will give
P25,000.00 worth of shares to the FIRST PARTY, and said FIRST PARTY shall also
be elected as director of the Corporation; and upon succeeding payments made by
the FIRST PARTY, shares of stock will be transferred to him until the total of
P100,000.00 worth of shares have been transferred to the name of the FIRST
PARTY; and once the entire amount of P250,000.00 is paid by the FIRST PARTY to
the SECOND and THIRD PARTY, then the remaining balance of the shares of stock
shall be transferred to him immediately;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">‘e)  That until the FIRST PARTY has fully paid
said amount of P250,000.00, the corporate structure and management at the
present time shall be maintained, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">all the stockholders and directors shall

SECOND and THIRD PARTY of the said amount of P250,000.00, all the obligations
of the corporation to the SECOND and THIRD PARTY, which are purely personal in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">nature,
shall be considered fully liquidated; but this shall not exceed P4,650.00 a

agreement, the FIRST PARTY shall make available to the corporation such
materials and capital as the corporation may need for its projects as
determined by the SECOND PARTY, but this shall be considered as an obligation

to the FIRST PARTY.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

P250,000.00 to the SECOND PARTY and THIRD PARTY, and the entire shares of the
corporation are transferred to him, it is agreed that the FIRST PARTY, in turn,
will transfer half of these shares to the SECOND PARTY; and the FIRST PARTY and

<p class="BODY">At the signing of the AGREEMENT, the stockholders of MASSIVE
informed UY that the company had several on-going construction projects,
including those of Queen’s Row Subdivision, Republic Flour Mills, and B.F.
Homes.  On the same occasion, UY issued
to Enrique P. Syquia a check postdated 22 December 1971 which bounced for lack
of funds.  UY, however, made good the
check by paying Syquia P20,000.00 in cash on 29 December 1971.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Out of the P20,000.00 paid by UY to Enrique P. Syquia, UY
borrowed P2,000.00 payable on or before 5 July 1972.  UY failed to pay this amount, which compelled Syquia to file a
collection suit against him in the City Court of Manila (Civil Case No.
209298).   The latter Court rendered
judgment against UY, who appealed the decision to the Court of First Instance
of Manila (Civil Case No. 87310).</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately after the signing of the AGREEMENT, UY was made a
co-manager of MASSIVE, pursuant to the AGREEMENT.  Ramon P. Syquia also asked UY for his promised contribution of
materials and funds.  Out of P100,000.00
worth of materials needed for the projects, UY was able to deliver  only P6,085.69.  He gave as an excuse the non-payment by his relatives of the
dividends which he intended to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">invest
in MASSIVE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">MASSIVE made three demands for payment of the damages caused by
UY’s failure to comply with his obligations under the AGREEMENT:  the first, addressed to UY dated 14 January
1972,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
UY wrote that he had been relieved from payment of the P30,000.00 required,
under paragraph 3(b) of the AGREEMENT because of the failure of the
stockholders of MASSIVE to deliver to him the company’s shares of stock worth
P25,000.00 upon his payment to them of the sum of P20,000.00<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">While UY received the letters dated 17 and 18 January 1972, he
did not reply to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the lack of fresh capital and construction materials,
MASSIVE aborted all its projects.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 87006, the trial court found that UY failed to
make available to MASSIVE the construction materials and funds needed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for </span>its projects; that the
construction materials delivered by UY to MASSIVE valued at P6,085.69 were
inadequate to carry out its various projects; that UY’s claim that he did not
understand the import of the AGREEMENT was unbelieveable; and, that it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">was UY who
reneged on his obligations under the AGREEMENT.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The trial court, after finding that it was UY who had violated
the terms of the contract, particularly paragraph 3 (h) thereof, held him
liable to pay MASSIVE P20,000.00 as damages for the Republic Flour Mills project,
P80,000.00 for the Queen’s Row Subdivision project, and P10,000.00 as
attorney’s fees.  The trial court denied
MASSIVE’s claim for damages with respect to the B.F. Homes project.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not resolve the issue on the right of UY to
rescind the contract, saying that this issue would have to be resolved in Civil
Case No. 87511.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In </span>Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Case No. 87511, the trial court found that </span>UY
entered into the contract freely and even with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">assistance </span>and advice of counsel; that there was no undue influence
or fraud exerted on him by MASSIVE<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">’</span>s
stockholders as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>justify the
nullification of the contract; and, that the said stockholders did not conceal
from UY the financial status of MASSIVE.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court however did not award any damages after finding
that all the parties had defaulted in the fulfillment of their obligations but
it could not determine who of the parties first violated the contract.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">UY appealed to the Court of Appeals from the decisions in both
cases.  The Court of Appeals, viewing
the evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>a different
light, found that the stockholders of MASSIVE were the ones who first violated
the terms of the AGREEMENT when they failed to assign to UY the P25,000.00
worth of the company’s shares of stock and to elect him a director of the
company upon his payment of P20,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In both AC-G.R. No. 64077-CV and AC-G.R. No. 65234-CV, the Court
of Appeals reversed the decisions of the Court of First Instance.  In addition, in AC-G.R. No. 65234-CV, the
Court of Appeals ordered MASSIVE to refund to UY the sum of P20,000.00 and to
pay P6,085.69, representing the cost of the materials delivered by UY to
MASSIVE, P5,000.00 as attorney’s fees and cost.  In AC-G.R. No. 65234-CV, the Court of Appeals made the stockholders
of MASSIVE subsidiarily liable to pay UY the amounts adjudged in AC-­G.R. No.
64077-CV to be paid by MASSIVE.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> The
Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Appeals,

obtained by fraud.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals sustained the trial court in its finding
that MASSIVE was a proper party to ask for specific performance of the
contract.  The appellate court noted
that the contract was signed by all the directors-stockholders of MASSIVE and
even had the conformity of said company.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the AGREEMENT imposed reciprocal obligations, the
question to resolve is who of the parties breached the contract first.  The starting point of the inquiry is the
contract itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the AGREEMENT, UY, as First Party, agreed to buy all the
outstanding shares of stock of MASSIVE and the stockholders of MASSIVE, as
Second and Third Parties, agreed to sell to him the said shares for
P250,000.00, under the following terms:</p>

<p class="BODY">The party required to act first in compliance with the terms of
the contract is no other than UY.</p>

<p class="BODY">While UY issued a postdated check for P20,000.00 on 16 December
1972 in payment of the earnest money required under paragraph 3 (a) of the
AGREEMENT, the check bounced when it was deposited for collection.  True, UY made good the check on 29 December
1971 but he had to borrow P2,000.00 out of  his payment of P20,000.00.  Having failed to pay this amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">by 5 July 1972 as promised, UY was sued in
the City Court of Manila for its collection.  Effectively, UY was able to pay only P18,000.00 out of the P20,000.00 he
was supposed to pay as earnest money.  This aspect of the case showed the financial difficulties besetting UY
and reflected poorly on his ability to meet his financial commitments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to his obligation to pay the earnest money of
P20,000.00, UY was required under paragraph 3 (h) of the AGREEMENT to make

upon the signing of the contract, such “materials and capital as the
corporation may need for its projects as determined by” Ramon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P. </span>Syquia.  UY was able to deliver to MASSIVE materials valued at only
P6,085.69 out of the P100,000.00 worth as required by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on-going projects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The infusion of fresh capital was the lifeblood of the projects
and the essence of his being brought in as an investor.  Without his capital contribution, the
company could not possibly operate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, UY failed to pay on or before 5 January 1972 the
P30,000.00 required under paragraph 3 (b) of the AGREEMENT.  UY cannot claim that he was relieved from
the payment of the monthly installment of P50,000.00 beginning 5 January
1973.  When the parties agreed that the
monthly installments should be paid out of the receivables and collections of
MASSIVE (paragraph 3 [c], <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">AGREEMENT), </span>it
was implied that there was actual cash received or collected.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals held that UY was relieved of his obligation
to pay the P30,000.00 after the stockholders of MASSIVE failed to deliver the
P20,000.00 worth of shares of stock of the company.  The thinking of the Court of Appeals was that after UY had paid the
P20,000.00 earnest money, it became the sellers’ turn to assign the shares of
stock to UY.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The Court of
Appeals erred in concluding that the </span>stockholders of MASSIVE were the
first to default on their obligations because it overlooked the fact that under
paragraph 3 (h) of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">AGREEMENT, </span>UY
was also obligated “immediately upon the signing of the contract” to contribute
materials and funds needed for the on-going projects.</p>

<p class="BODY">UY was aware of these twin-obligations of his, so much so that
his complaint in Civil Case No. 87511 against the stockholders of MASSIVE was
anchored on his alleged compliance with the provisions of paragraphs 3 (a) and
(h) of the AGREEMENT.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the stockholders to deliver to UY the P25,000.00
worth of shares is not as substantial a breach as that accorded it by the
appellate court.  As a matter of fact,
UY did not set up such default as a defense in his answer in Civil Case No.
87006, leading one to conclude that such contention was a mere after-thought.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Art. 1191 of the Civil Code, the power to rescind or the
right to resolve is not absolute and must be based on a serious breach of an
obligation as to defeat the object of the parties in making the agreement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The
non-delivery of the certificates of stock to Uy and his non-election to the
board of directors were not serious breaches, particularly considering that he
has not shown the necessity or urgency for the transfer of the s</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">hares in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">his name
or his election as director.  Besides,
the trial court is given the discretion to allow a period within which a party
in default may be permitted to perform the stipulation upon which the claim for
rescission of the contract is based, </span>especially when the breach is not
substantial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
