consulted Dr. <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> B. Claudio and was diagnosed
as suffering from "<u>sinus tachycardia</u>." The doctor prescribed
the following for him: <span class="SpellE"><u>Trazepam</u></span>, a
tranquilizer; and <span class="SpellE"><u>Aptin</u></span>, a beta-blocker drug.
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span> consulted the same doctor again on 3

material information from it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed a complaint against Great Pacific with the
Insurance Commission for recovery of the insurance proceeds. During the hearing

874 which voids an insurance contract, whether or not concealment was
intentionally made, was not applicable to <span class="SpellE">Canilang's</span>
case as that law became effective only on 1 June 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by Great Pacific, the Court of Appeals reversed' and
set aside the decision of the Insurance Commissioner and dismissed Thelma <span class="SpellE">Canilang's</span> complaint and Great Pacific's counterclaim. The
Court of Appeals found that the use of the word "<u>intentionally</u>"
by the Insurance Commissioner in defining and resolving the issue agreed upon
by the parties at pre-trial before the Insurance Commissioner was not supported
by the evidence; that the issue agreed upon by the parties had been whether the
deceased insured, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span>, made a <u>material
concealment</u> as to the state of his health at the time of the filing of
insurance application, justifying respondent's denial of the claim. The Court
of Appeals also found that the failure of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span>
to disclose previous medical consultation and treatment constituted material
information which should' have been communicated to Great Pacific to enable the
latter to make proper inquiries. The Court of Appeals finally held that the <u>Ng
<span class="SpellE">Gan</span> Zee</u> case which had involved <u>misrepresentation</u>
was not applicable in respect of the case at bar which involves <u>concealment</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">We note that in addition to the negative
statements made by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span> in paragraphs 1 and 2
of the medical declaration, he failed to disclose in the appropriate space,
under the caption "Exceptions," that he had twice consulted Dr. <span class="SpellE">WiIfredo</span> B. Claudio who had found him to be suffering
from" "<u>sinus tachycardia</u>" and "acute
bronchitis."</p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant statutory provisions as they stood at the time Great
Pacific issued the contract of insurance and at the time Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span> died, are set out in P.D. No. 1460, also known as
the Insurance Code of 1978, which went into effect on 11 June 1978. These
provisions read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 26. A neglect to communicate that <u>which a party knows</u>
and <u>ought to communicate</u>, is called a concealment."</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 28. Each party to a contract of insurance must communicate to
the other, in good faith, all factors <u>within his knowledge</u> which are <u>material
to the contract</u> and as to which he makes no warranty, and which the other
has not the means of ascertaining." (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Under the foregoing provisions, the
information concealed must be information which the concealing party knew and
"ought to [have] communicate[d]," that is to .say, information which
was "material to the contract." The test of materiality is contained
in Section 31 of the Insurance Code of 1978 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 31. Materiality is to be determined not by the event,
but <u>solely</u> by the <u>probable and reasonable influence of the facts upon
the party to whom the communication is due</u>, in forming his estimate of the
disadvantages of the proposed contract, or in making his inquiries."
(Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"<u>Sinus tachycardia</u>" is considered present
"when the heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The symptoms of this condition include pounding in the chest and sometimes
faintness and weakness of the person affected. The following elaboration was offered
by Great Pacific and set out by the Court of Appeals in its Decision:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Sinus tachycardia</u> is defined as sinus-initiated; heart
rate faster than 100 beats per minute. (<u>Harrison's P</u>rinciples of
Internal Medicine, 8th ed. [1978], p. 1193.) It is. among others, a common
reaction to heart disease, including myocardial infarction, <u>and heart
failure per se</u>. (Henry J.L. Marriot, M.D., <u>Electrocardiography,</u> 6th
ed. [1977], p. 127.) The medication prescribed by Dr. Claudio for treatment of <span class="SpellE">Canilang's</span> ailment on June 18, 1982, indicates the
condition that said physician was trying to manage. Thus, he prescribed <span class="SpellE"><u>Trazepam</u></span><u>,</u> (<u>Philippine Index of Medical
Specialties</u> (PIMS), Vol. 14,. No. 3, Dec. 1985, p. 112.) which is
anti-anxiety, anti-<span class="SpellE">convulsant</span>, muscle-relaxant; and <span class="SpellE"><u>Aptin</u></span>, (<u>Idem</u>, p. 36) <u>a cardiac drug, for
palpitations and nervous heart</u>. Such treatment could have been a very
material information to the insurer in determining the action to be taken on <span class="SpellE">Canilang's</span> application for life insurance coverage."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the information which
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span> failed to disclose was material to the
ability of Great Pacific to estimate the probable risk he presented as a
subject of life insurance. Had <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span> disclosed his
visits to his doctor, the diagnosis made and the medicines prescribed by such
doctor, in the insurance application, it may be reasonably assumed that Great
Pacific would have made further inquiries and would have probably refused to
issue a non-medical insurance policy or, at the very least, required a higher
premium for the same coverage.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The materiality of the information withheld by Great Pacific did not depend
upon the state of mind of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span>. A man's
state of mind or subjective belief is not capable of proof in our judicial
process, except through proof of external acts or failure to act from which
inferences as to his subjective belief may be reasonably drawn. Neither does
materiality depend upon the actual or physical events which ensue. Materiality
relates rather to the "probable and reasonable influence of the
facts" upon the party to whom the communication should have been made, in
assessing the risk involved in making or omitting to make further inquiries and
in accepting the application for insurance; that "probable and reasonable
influence of the facts" concealed must, of course, be determined
objectively, by the judge ultimately.</p>

<p class="BODY">The insurance Great Pacific applied for was a
"non-medical" insurance policy. In <span class="SpellE"><u>Saturnino</u></span><u>
v. Philippine-American Life Insurance </u>Company,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> if
anything, the <u>waiver of medical examination [in a non-medical insurance
contract] renders even more material the information required of the applicant
concerning previous condition of health and diseases suffered</u>, for such
information necessarily constitutes an important factor which the insurer takes
into consideration in deciding whether to issue the policy or not x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

(Emphases supplied)<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Insurance Commissioner had also ruled that the failure of
Great Pacific to convey .certain information to the insurer was not
"intentional" in nature, for the reason that Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span> believed that he was suffering from minor ailment
like a common cold. Section 27 of the Insurance Code of 1978 as it existed from
1974 up to 1985, that is, throughout the time range material for present
purposes, provided that:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 27. A concealment entitles the injured party to rescind
a contract of insurance.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The preceding statute, Act No. 2427, as
it stood from 1914 up to 1974, had provided:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 26. A concealment, <u>whether intentional or
unintentional</u>, entitles the injured party to rescind a contract of
insurance." (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Upon the other hand, in 1985, the
Insurance Code of 1978 was amended by B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 874.
This <u>subsequent</u> statute modified Section 27 of the Insurance Code of
1978 so as to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 27. A concealment <u>whether intentional or
unintentional</u> entitles the injured party to rescind a contract of
insurance." (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The unspoken theory of the Insurance Commissioner appears to have
been that by deleting the phrase "intentional or unintentional," the
Insurance Code of 1978 (prior to its amendment by B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
874) intended to limit the kinds of concealment which generate a right to
rescind on the part of the injured party to "intentional
concealments." This argument is not persuasive. As a simple matter of
grammar, it may be noted that "intentional" and
"unintentional" cancel each other out. The net result therefore of
the phrase "whether intentional or unintentional" is precisely <u>to
leave unqualified</u> the term "concealment." Thus, Section 27 of the
Insurance Code of 1978 is properly read as referring to "<u>any</u>
concealment" without regard to whether such concealment is intentional or
unintentional. The phrase "whether intentional or unintentional" was
in fact superfluous. The deletion of the phrase "whether intentional or
unintentional" could <u>not</u> have had the effect of imposing an
affirmative requirement that a concealment must be intentional if it is to
entitle the injured party to rescind a contract of insurance. The restoration
in 1985 by B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 874 of the phrase "whether
intentional or unintentional" merely underscored the fact that all
throughout (from 1914 to 1985), the statute did <u>not</u> require proof that
concealment must be "intentional" in order to authorize rescission by
the injured party.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, in the case at bar, the nature of the facts not
conveyed to the insurer was such that the failure to communicate <u>must have
been</u> intentional rather than merely inadvertent. For Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span> could not have been unaware that his heart beat
would at times rise to high and alarming levels and that he had consulted a
doctor twice in the two (2) months before applying for non-medical insurance.
Indeed, the last medical consultation took place just the day before the
insurance application was filed. In all probability, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span>
went to visit his doctor precisely because of the discomfort and concern
brought about by his experiencing "<u>sinus tachycardia</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">We find it difficult to take seriously the argument that Great
Pacific had waived inquiry into the concealment by issuing the insurance policy
notwithstanding <span class="SpellE">Canilang's</span> failure to set out answers
to some of the questions in the insurance application. Such failure precisely
constituted concealment on the part of <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span>.
Petitioner's argument, if accepted, would obviously erase Section 27 from the
Insurance Code of 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">It remains only to note that the Court of Appeals finding that
the parties had <u>not</u> agreed in the pretrial before the Insurance
Commission that the relevant issue was whether or not Jaime <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span>
had <u>intentionally</u> concealed material information from the insurer, was
supported by the evidence of record, i.e., the Pre-trial Order itself dated 17
October 1984 and the Minutes of the Pre-trial Conference .dated 15 October
1984, which "readily shows that the word 'intentional' does not appear in
the statement or definition of the issue in the said Order and Minutes."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
