1974 that he received again the order, because the processing thereof by one

that since the gasoline was actually delivered on March 5, 1974, the then

prevailing on February 14, 1974 the date when the order was made and paid by
plaintiff with a cashier's check.</p>

<p class="BODY">To such contention, plaintiff disagreed by arguing that defendant
committed a contractual breach and incurred in delay that should make it liable
for damages when it did not deliver the gasoline to plaintiff on the agreed due
date of delivery appearing on the prepaid order i.e. February 15, 1974 and that
therefore defendant cannot claim benefits by reason of this breach.</p>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
the first place, you will recall that this time there was a very harsh demand
for gasoline and there were about at least two hundred or three hundred cars
lined up waiting for their chance to get their twenty (20) liters fuel for the
day and since we have been operating since 1966 we have developed a clientele
which relied on us for their fuel supplies, because of the fact that we were
unable, by virtue of this failure to deliver by Mobil Oil, to provide our
clientele and the public in general with this allocation of ours, my <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">oil customers were highly disgusted with
us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And in fact some customers

<blockquote>One of the reasons <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">why </span>Mobil
Oil Philippines, Inc. did not deliver immediately the pre-paid order of February
15, 1974 involved in this case is because <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Fernando A. <span class="SpellE">Pedrosa</span> had an unpaid balance of
P5,653.34 on his account as of December 31, 1973 and it was company policy to
require all dealers to liquidate all their outstanding balances at the end of
1973 before further delivery of oil products would be made to them (T.S.N.,
January 8, 1975, p. 30; April 2, 1975, pp. 25-27, p. 8) and that the price
differential of P2,880.00 had not yet been paid.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>However, the exact state of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
account balance with Mobil was really immaterial for the purpose of filling <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> February 15th order because as judicially
represented by appellant in their answer, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
order of February 15, 1974 involved in this case was duly approved by Mobil's
credit man as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">On <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1974</st1:date>,
plaintiff, thru his representative, placed a product order at <st1:time minute="20" hour="14">2:20 P.M.</st1:time> and to accommodate plaintiff, the
said order was approved by the credit man before closing of the Mobil Terminal
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 P.M.</st1:time> with a final warning that
no further delivery would be acted upon unless the outstanding balance of P5<span class="GramE">,653.34</span> is fully paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<blockquote>Mobil's credit man, <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> Marcella

the order of February 15th although there was still an unpaid balance of P5<span class="GramE">,653.34</span> because what would really be affected by the unpaid
balance of P5,653.34 are the order subsequent to the order of <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And that order of February 15 was delivered

that appellant was demanding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This goes
to show, that contrary to appellant's contention, they do deliver orders even

<blockquote>Another reason or excuse advanced by the appellant why the delivery
of the pre-paid order of <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="2">February 15,

<blockquote>The above rebuttal evidence clearly, indisputably and conclusively
shows that Mobil Oil Philippines, Inc. made deliveries to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> Franco's gasoline station on the same day as the
date of the invoices in accordance with the request that the delivery be made
"today".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These invoices
disprove the excuses of Mobil that it had a beck-log of gasoline orders and
that the coupon system of distribution then in force accounted for the alleged
delay in delivery of plaintiff's order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another Mobil dealer and witness for <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
Joaquin <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span>, testified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in </span>this case in connection with a pre-paid order he placed with
the company on <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1974</st1:date>,
a Thursday, which was never delivered because the price increase took effect on
<st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1974</st1:date> and Mobil
wanted him to pay the price differential.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span> refused to pay the price
increase differential and filed an administrative case against Mobil with the
Oil Industry Commission (OIC), OIC Case No. 193 entitled "In the Matter of
the Refusal to Deliver Prepaid Oil Products, Joaquin P. <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span>,
Petitioner, versus Mobil Oil Philippines, Inc., Respondent."</blockquote>

<blockquote>In its decision, the Oil Industry Commission, while finding itself <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">without the </span>jurisdiction or power to grant
the relief Mr. <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span> prayed for, nonetheless found
respondent Mobil definitely guilty of the charge imputed to it by complainant <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on
pages 4 and 5 of the decision, the Oil Industry Commission said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">On this, it is our considered view that the enticement of
additional profit should not be allowed to prevail over the social and economic
responsibility that the oil companies assumed the very moment they set out to
manufacture and sell petroleum products in this country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the incident subject matter of this case
occurred, the whole country including the Metropolitan Manila <span class="GramE">Area,</span> was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the
grip of an acute fuel shortage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was
precisely the reason why the government, through all the agencies concerned,
was pushing through a campaign intended to make available to the consuming
public as much product as possible by going against hoarders and <span class="SpellE">blackmarketers</span> and conducting inventories of all kinds of
petroleum products in refineries, depots, and gasoline stations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any act of withholding any quantity of
petroleum product from the market then undermined to the same extent the
efforts of the government to insure a continuous flow of supply.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
Commission, however, could see no reason (and no reason really was put forward
by respondent) for withholding the delivery, except that respondent had
anticipated the grant of the increase in prices, and motivated by a desire to
realize more profit, held on to its product instead of causing its immediate
delivery to the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The adverse
effect on the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> drivers and operators and the
commuting public of such ill-advised decision of respondent can only be
imagined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But certainly 6,000 liters of
diesel oil could have caused many <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span> to ply
their respective routes and carry passengers to their places of work and
thereby afforded many segments of the community some form of benefit or
another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit N, pp. 4 and 5)</p>

<blockquote>Therefore, in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the decision, the Oil Industry Commission declared:</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . declares respondent's act of
unreasonably delaying delivery of petroleum products ordered and paid for in
advance by petitioner to be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
directives and regulations on the matter, and hereby sternly warns said
respondent that any other similar act that it may commit in the future with
respect to herein petitioner or to any of its other dealers shall be dealt with
more severely.</blockquote>

1975, pp. 145-147)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. Mario <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, witness for
defendant-appellant, also testified that they had to recall and re-process all
orders previously invoiced because of the price increase which took effect on
February 18, 1974 (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., April 2, 1975, p. 14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The above clearly indicates that defendant-appellant gave priority
to the recall and reprocess of all invoices already with their warehouse and
dispatcher for re-­pricing because of the price increase which took effect on <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This means that all invoices covering orders
already paid for as early as February 14 and 15, 1974 were recalled and revised
to reflect the price increase and said orders were not delivered unless the
dealers pay the corresponding price differential.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant-appellant cancelled the orders of
dealers like <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> Franco and Joaquin P. <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span> who refused to pay the price differentials and
their payments were just treated as payments on their respective accounts (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., April 22, 1976, pp. 61-63)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>Therefore,
defendant-appellant's act of unreasonably delaying delivery of petroleum
products ordered and paid for in advance by its dealers is not only <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the directives and regulations of the Oil
Industry <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Commission, but also allowed
appellant to amass unreasonably huge profits which if it had exercised
fairness, honesty, good faith, and ordinary diligence in its business dealings,
said profits should have gone to its dealers to whom it legitimately belonged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such awards are necessary retribution for the
