British subject (Shirley Cheng Lai <span class="SpellE">Har</span>) for a
violation of Central Bank rules supposedly committed at the Manila International

Court that the crime charged had indeed been committed, in consequence of which
the Court promulgated judgment on <u>February 13, 1984</u> acquitting the
tourist and directing the return to her of the currency taken from her;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the attention of the Trial Court to the fact that they had commenced, allegedly
on <u>February 13, 1984 also</u>, seizure and forfeiture proceedings relative
to <span style="">the currency subject of the
unsuccessful prosecution, and that, as a result, the Court had been divested of
power to order the return of the foreign currency to the accused, since under
the law the Bureau of Customs had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

foreign currency subject of the offense <span style="">charged;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Court of the existence of any valid reason to warrant their being 'given time
to elevate the matter to higher courts, said Court having instead directed on <u>February
17, 1984</u> the release and delivery to the acquitted accused of the foreign
currency subject of the prosecution, there being in the view of the Court
urgent reason for the tourist's immediate return to her home in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, apart from the fact that her return home had
already been considerably delayed by the case filed against her;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

thereafter conducted seizure proceedings for the avowed purpose of bringing
about the forfeiture to the Government of the foreign currency subject of the
unsuccessful prosecution in Court, culminating in the rendition by the Acting
Collector of a "Decision" on </span><u><span style="">March 7, </span></u><u><span style="">1984</span></u><span style=""> decreeing such forfeiture, this, despite
their full awareness that the currency sought to be forfeited had already been
brought out of the country by its owner as early as February 17, 1984 and
therefore was no longer within the jurisdiction of the Customs authorities</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> ---<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">they

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is beyond question
that by the filing of the information charging a violation of Central Bank
rules, involving specifically identified currency, the Court acquired
jurisdiction of the offense as well as of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>,
the money.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It acquired plenary power not only to try
and decide the Chief issue of whether or not a crime had been committed by the
accused, but also in the light of the resolution of that chief issue, to make
such disposition of the property subject of or otherwise involved in the
alleged crime as was needful and proper.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is also beyond
question that after invoking the juris­diction of the Regional Trial Court and
actively participating in the prosecution of the case before it, the Customs
officials cannot now be permitted to repudiate that jurisdiction or divest the
Court of authority over the currency involved in the supposed offense by a
subsequent claim of exclusive jurisdiction over the same currency, specially
where the Court has already adjudged, after due trial, that the money, not
being subject of any crime, should be returned to the owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Settled is the doctrine that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>" * * a party can not invoke the
jurisdiction of a court to secure affirmative relief against his opponent and,
after obtaining or failing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question that
same jurisdiction (Dean vs. Dean, 136 Or. 694, 86 A.L.R. 79).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case just cited, by way of explaining
the rule, it was further said that the question whether the court had
jurisdiction either of the subject-matter of the action or of the parties was
not important in such cases because the party is barred from such conduct <u>not
because the judgment or order of the court is valid and conclusive as an
adjudication, but for the reason that such a practice can not be tolerated</u>
-- <span style="">obviously for reasons of public
policy.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, it has also been held that after voluntarily
submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it is
too late for the loser to question the jurisdiction or power of the court
(Pease vs. <span class="SpellE">Rathbun</span>-Jones, etc., 243 U.S. 273, 61 L.
Ed. 715, 37 S. Ct. 283; St. Luis, etc. <span style="">vs.
McBride, 141 U.S. 127, 35 L. Ed. 659).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in Littleton vs. Burgess, 16 </span><span style="">Wyo. </span><span style="">58, the Court said
that it is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction
of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to
afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape a penalty."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case in question is readily distinguishable from those
adverted to by the Customs authorities in which this Court had upheld the exercise
by them of exclusive jurisdiction in the matter of seizure and forfeiture of
goods involved in alleged infringements of customs or tariff laws or
regulations.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In the latter cases, the Customs authorities had from the outset asserted
jurisdiction over the goods claimed to have been imported or attempted to be
brought out in violation of customs and tariff laws (or laws or rules for the
enforcement of which the Customs authorities are charged) and courts had tried
to themselves assume jurisdiction over the same goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in the case now before this Court, it was
the Customs authorities who had invoked the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial
Court and laid squarely before it the matter of the determination of the
existence of the offense and the disposition of the property involved; and it
was only after they had failed to obtain the judgment they obviously expected
that they bethought themselves to take over the case by instituting seizure and
forfeiture proceedings in their own office.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Their cause is not
enhanced, parenthetically, by their having avowedly conducted proceedings which
they clearly knew to be nothing but an empty ritual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went through the motions of setting for
hearing the seizure case instituted by them for the confiscation of the
currency in question, of issuing a declaration of default, and of rendering a
"Decision" thereon on March 7, 1984</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> although </span>they were fully aware that,
as already pointed out, the money <span style="">sought
to be forfeited had already long since been brought out of the country by its
owner and hence was no longer within their ju­risdiction or that of any court
or entity in the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, reference must be made to the findings of the Hon.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span>
of the Intermediate Appellate Court, to whom this Court referred the proceedings
at bar for investigation and report<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>,
to the effect that</p>

<blockquote>" * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The undersigned Investigator therefore, concludes that respondent
honestly believed that her action in ordering the return of the foreign
exchange to the accused was correct and that she did not have to allow the
customs lawyer an opportunity to elevate the ruling to the proper appellate
court. * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering ** the pressing
circumstances under which respondent had to labor at the time in her belief that
it was a tourist case and that it was too late for the Customs to file the
warrant of seizure and detention after the decision of the respondent judge had
already been promulgated, the undersigned believes that there was no malice or
bad faith in the actuations of the respondent judge in not giving time for the
customs law­yer to appeal her order of release.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The undersigned therefore recommends that the charges against respond­ent
<span style="">for </span>misconduct be
dismissed."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
