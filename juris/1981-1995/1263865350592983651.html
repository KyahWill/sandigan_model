Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rosalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sismaet</span>,
Jr., freely and voluntarily entered pleas of not guilty thereto and trial
ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as summarized by the Solicitor General, are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Sometime in 1976, Anita <span class="SpellE">Capile</span>, a mother
of five (5) children, took into her custody a child barely one (1) year old
whom she named Maria Anita <span class="SpellE">Capile</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 3, 6, <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="4">April
 2, 1986</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria Anita grew
up with weak mental capacity, failing twice in Kindergarten and once in Grade
I, and taking almost eight (8) years to reach Grade IV (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
pp. 9-10, <u>id</u>.; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 2-3, <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1986</st1:date>).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“To train Maria Anita for responsibility, Anita tasked her to get hog
feeds, consisting of discarded fruits and vegetables, from the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City Public Market.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the course thereof, her daughter informed her that she got a ‘Lolo’
in the market who gave her (Maria Anita) plenty of hog feeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She informed her husband about this
development, who advised her to get acquainted with the man referred to by
Maria Anita as ‘Lolo’ whom she later knew as Rafael Ortiz, the
accused-appellant herein (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 11, <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1986</st1:date>).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Since the time that appellant came to know Anita, he became
friendly with her family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every now and
then, he would bring to the <span class="SpellE">Capiles</span> plenty of hog
feeds he gathered as ‘<span class="SpellE">barienda</span>’ in the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City Public Market.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes coming from the market, he helped Maria Anita push the cart
with hog feeds going to their house (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span> pp. 11, 25, <u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In view of appellant’s attitude, the <span class="SpellE">Capile</span>
spouses trusted him fully and treated him like their own brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They never asked any question whenever
appellant would bring out their daughter Maria Anita on the pretext of
attending Sunday masses (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 26, <u>id</u>.; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 39, 43, 47, <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="6">June
 9, 1986</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria Anita, on
her part, helped appellant clean his office everyday, usually from <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="30" hour="12">12:30</st1:time>
<st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
p. 37, <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1986</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, during the confirmation of Maria Anita,
the <span class="SpellE">Capile</span> spouses got him as Maria Anita’s
godfather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, p. 11, <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="4">April
 2, 1986</st1:date>).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“On the fateful day of <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="8">August
 18, 1985</st1:date>, Maria Anita had just turned eleven (11) years old, her
birthday being <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>
time, she went to the public market to gather hog feeds and saw appellant
sweeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She inquired from him if he
had any hog feeds, and he answered that the feeds were inside his office and
invited her to go with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carrying her
cart, she went with him to his office (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span> pp. 14-18,
<st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1986</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Upon reaching the office, once they were inside, appellant closed
and locked the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria Anita was
surprised that appellant forced her to go up to the second floor by holding her
blouse at the nape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She struggled but it
was all in vain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he told her to
drink a half-filled bottle of coke stating that it was his leftover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she refused, he forced her to open her
mouth and drink the contents of the bottle which almost choked her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She struggled and kicked him, but he was able
to make her consume the <span class="SpellE">softdrink</span> which tasted
differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She fell into sleep (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 19-24, <span class="GramE"><u>id</u></span>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“She woke up around <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o’clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon and felt pain on the pubic region of her stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She found herself naked and saw appellant
also naked at the end of the room behind the table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant came near her and poked a gun at
her, threatening to shoot her if she told anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She got scared, while appellant tried again
to kiss her lips and hold her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But she managed to struggle, box and pull appellant’s hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then ordered her to dress up and go ahead
so that nobody would notice her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Still feeling the pain on her abdomen, she proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Teria’s</span> place still inside
the public market to get some hog feeds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, appellant helped her push her cart, during which he reiterated
his threat until they reached the corner of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Trece</span> <span class="SpellE">Martires</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>
where she walked alone towards their house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She never reported the incident to her parents because of her fear of
appellant’s threat (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span> pp. 19-37, <u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On several occasions thereafter, appellant went to the <span class="SpellE">Capile</span> residence and asked permission from Maria Anita’s
parents on the pretext that he would bring his goddaughter to the church to
which request her parents readily consented.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because of fear of appellant, she went with him; but instead of bringing
her to the church, appellant would bring her to some other places like the
movie house ‘Cine Maria’ or the beach in <span class="SpellE">Noveleta</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span> pp. 39-46, <u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On one occasion, appellant, after talking to her parents and
alleging that they were going to the church, boarded her on a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> without any passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
developed an engine trouble and broke down, so that the driver alighted and put
the hood up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the hood was up,
appellant tied her hands at the back, blindfolded and gagged her with a
handkerchief, and brought her to a grassy portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was already dark and no people seemed to
inhabit the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He undressed her and
made her lie on her back, while he undressed himself and lay on top of
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant inserted his private
parts into hers and was able to penetrate one-half (1/2) of the whole length of
his penis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She struggled to remove his
penis from her vagina and was able to do so only after she kicked him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She freed herself, removed her blindfold and
gag, and dressed up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant again
threatened her not to tell anybody which instilled in her a fear that he might
shoot her if she went to the market in case she would not obey him (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 47-60, 62-65, <span class="GramE"><u>id</u></span>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“She was brought home by appellant riding in another <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
reaching home, she urinated and saw blood oozing from her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She confided to her mother that her urine
contained blood and her mother, thinking that it was a menstruation, advised
her to take a bath (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 61, 66-69, <span class="GramE"><u>id</u></span>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Every now and then, appellant went to their house and talked to
her parents which made her angry, but fear overcame her <span class="SpellE">everytime</span>
that appellant stared at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
incident at the grassy area was again repeated because she was overcome by her
fear of appellant who kept on staring at her as if threatening to kill her (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 72-73, <span class="GramE"><u>id</u></span>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The same incident was again repeated in the toilet of the public
market <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> that she collected hog feeds about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant would drag her to the toilet,
threatening to kill her if she would shout.<span style="">&nbsp;

overpowered by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would even
beg mercy from him saying ‘<span class="SpellE">ninong</span> do not do it, if my
Mama will know she will kill me.’ However, her pleas fell on deaf ears and
appellant would succeed in raping her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was repeated more than eight (8) times (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span><span class="GramE">,,</span> pp. 25-35, <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="7">July

<blockquote>“The rape of Maria Anita also happened during <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> time when she would go to the market to collect hog

<blockquote>“Anita <span class="SpellE">Capile</span>, the mother of Maria Anita,
only knew of the crime committed against her daughter when her youngest son was
told by somebody that he saw Ortiz petting and holding the private parts of
Maria Anita.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When confronted, Maria
Anita told her parents everything that had been done to her by appellant (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 14-17, <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="4">April

the Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, p. 65, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finding that the child was eleven (11) years old when the victim
was raped and that the accused was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of Rape on all eight (8) counts, the trial court sentenced Ortiz to undergo
imprisonment term of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
in all eight cases; to indemnify the offended party Maria Anita <span class="SpellE">Capile</span> the amount of twenty thousand pesos (P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) as moral damages in all cases without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency; and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 11, RTC Decision, p.
54, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant now assigns the following errors committed by the trial
court, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>IN CONCLUDING THAT THE VICTIM WAS ELEVEN YEARS OF AGE AT THE TIME
OF THE COMMISSION OF RAPE DESPITE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE THERETO THUS MAKING THE
OFFENSE FALL UNDER STATUTORY RAPE;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>IN NOT CONSIDERING THAT THE HYMEN OF THE VICTIM WAS FOUND TO REMAIN
INTACT DESPITE TESTIMONY OF THE VICTIM THAT THERE WAS FULL PENETRATION OF
ACCUSED PENIS IN HER PRIVATE ORGAN.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is appellant’s contention that there was no sufficient showing
that Maria Anita was eleven (11) years old at the time of rape because such
conclusion was merely anchored on the reckoning of her adopted mother who used
her daughter’s physical appearance at the time of adoption as basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mother testified on this point.</p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
old was she, if you can tell this Honorable Court when you adopted Maria?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
than one year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
do you say that she was more than one year old when according to you <span class="SpellE">you</span> do not know her date of birth?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
experience, because I am a mother of 5 children and so I can determine.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
big was she at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was about two feet tall.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
was she able to talk already by the time that you adopted her?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could walk but she could not
talk.” (pp. 15-16, Brief for the Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>,
p. 65, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As aptly put by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>“Being a mother of five (5) children, Anita <span class="SpellE">Capile</span>
is experienced enough to know the age group to which Maria Anita belongs, for
each age group has a peculiar developmental characteristic (Marlow, Pediatric
Nursing, 5th ed. pp. 27, 344-356, 508-512).” (p. 16, Brief for the Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>; p. 65, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that the child was more than eleven (11) years old, her
mental capacity is way below the said age group considering the fact that she
failed twice in Kindergarten, once in Grade I, and it took her eight (8) years
to reach Grade IV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the child was over twelve (12) years
of age when her honor was violated, still there was rape under paragraphs one
(1) and two (2) of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under paragraph 1 of Article 335, force and intimidation were
committed against Maria Anita when she testified that appellant used force on
her to make her agree to his lewd designs by dragging her or tying her
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, there were instances where
appellant threatened to kill her if the latter tells anybody of the incidents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Maria Anita was definitely cowed by appellant considering not
only her tender age but, more importantly, the moral ascendancy of appellant
who is her godfather and got the confidence of her parents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under paragraph 2 of the same Article, Maria Anita was deprived
of reason or otherwise unconscious when it was shown that when she was raped on
<st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1985</st1:date>, she was
forced to drink Coca-Cola which tasted different and made her unconscious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second assigned error, the absence of <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> laceration was fully explained by Dr. Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Belgica</span>, the NBI medico-legal who examined Maria Anita, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is
<span class="SpellE">is</span> possible, Doctor that although that there was
sexual intercourse on a minor, eleven years old for the hymen to remain intact
despite such act of coitus?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is possible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
could that be possible, Doctor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
is possible, sir on several situations or occasions like for instance sexual <span class="GramE">intercourse, that</span> is distensible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
do you mean distensible?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
was sexual intercourse but no complete penetration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sexual organ of the male would have
barely touched the <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> area but would have
touched the external genitalia of the girl.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
your finding as contained in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D, could it be
possible that there was a slight penetration?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
is possible, sir.” (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, p.
5, <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1986</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the fact that the hymen was not lacerated does not negate
rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complete or full penetration of
the complainant’s private organ was not necessary to consummate the crime of
rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The slightest penetration was
sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was the rupture of
the hymen essential for the consummation of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that there is proof of entrance
of the male organ within the labia of the pudendum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Cruz y de Belen, G.R. 82121,
December 29, 1989)</p>

<p class="BODY">Maria Anita <span class="SpellE">Capile</span> testified:</p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
he successful in making a penetration on your vagina with his penis?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
in all?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One-half.”</span> (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, p. 82, <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="6">June
 9, 1986</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the appealed decision is hereby
