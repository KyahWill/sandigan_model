				<BR><STRONG>GRINO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition <span style="">for </span><i>certiorari</i>,
Benjamin D. Sison assails his removal as Municipal Agricultural Officer of San
Fabian, Pangasinan, and his subsequent reappointment as Production Technician,
for being violative of his right to security of tenure under the 1987
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 30, 1980, by virtue of Special Order No. 64, series of
1980, petitioner was designated as “Municipal Agricultural Officer for San
Fabian, Pangasinan (District III)” by the then Provincial Executive Officer of
Pangasinan, Romeo Zarraga (p. 87, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 1, 1986, he was extended a permanent appointment <span style="">as </span>Municipal Agriculture and Food
Officer (MAFO) in the Ministry <span style="">of </span>Agriculture
and Food, Region I, Pangasinan.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 30, 1987, Executive Order No. 116 was issued renaming
the “Ministry of Agriculture and Food as Ministry of Agriculture, Reorganizing
Its Units Integrating All Offices and Agencies Whose Functions Relate to
Agriculture and Fishery Into The Ministry And For Other Purposes.”</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the reorganization, petitioner was removed from
his position as MAFO of San Fabian and one Bonifacio Molina, Jr., was appointed
in his place (p. 43, Rollo).  Petitioner
was demoted to the position of Production Technician (p. 46, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the Civil Service Commission which
referred the case to the Reorganization Appeals Board of the Department of
Agriculture (DA-RAB) which denied his request for reconsideration on March 26,
1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 10, 1990, the CSC dismissed his appeal for lack of
merit (pp. 26-29, RoIlo).  His motion
for reconsideration was likewise denied (pp. 60-64, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for review should be granted in line with our
decision in the consolidated cases of Bustamante, et al. vs. Executive
Secretary, Secretary Carlos Dominguez and Civil Service Commission (186 SCRA
109) where we set aside the reorganization of the Department of Agriculture
under Executive Order No. 116 for failure to observe the guidelines prescribed
in Executive Order No. 17.  This Court
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>“We are constrained to set aside the reorganizations embodied in
these consolidated petitions because the heads of departments and agencies
concerned have chosen to rely on their own concepts of unlimited discretion and
‘progressive’ ideas on reorganization instead of showing that they have
faithfully complied with the clear letter and spirit of the two constitutions
[referring to the Freedom Constitution and the 1987 Constitution] and the
statutes governing reorganization.” (186 SCRA 152-153.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The reorganization of MAO’s in the Department of Agriculture,
which is the very same reorganization involved in the case at bar, was
nullified and set aside by this Court in the case of <u>Parian,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Civil</u> <u>Service</u> <u>Commission</u> (G.R. No. 96535,
October 15, 1991), as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“We set aside all those reorganizations including the
reorganization of the Department of Agriculture which was effected through
examinations given to the employees by the DA/SGV Steering Committee, on the
ground that they did not comply with the guidelines in E.O. No. 17, the 1987
Constitution, and Rep. Act No. 6656.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The President’s Executive Order No. 17 dated
May 28, 1986 enumerates the following grounds for the separation/replacement of
personnel:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.05pt; text-indent: -20.25pt;">‘1. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Existence <span style="">of </span>a case for summary dismissal pursuant to Section 40 of the
Civil Service Law;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.05pt; text-indent: -20.25pt;">‘2.  Existence of a probable cause for violation
of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act as determined by the Ministry Head
concerned;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.05pt; text-indent: -20.25pt;">‘3.  Gross incompetence or inefficiency in the
discharge of functions;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.05pt; text-indent: -20.25pt;">‘4.  Misuse of public office for partisan political
purposes;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.05pt; text-indent: -20.25pt;">‘5. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any other analogous ground showing that the
incumbent is unfit to remain in the service or his separation/replacement is in
the interest of the service.’</p>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style=""> </span>The 1987 Constitution provides that ‘no officer
or employee of the civil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause
provided by law’ (Sec. 2[3], Article IX [B], 1987 Constitution of the
Philippines).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3)<span style=""> </span>Republic Act No. 6656 sets clear-cut policies
and guidelines on government reorganization to protect the security of tenure
of civil service employees and officers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“All of the above:  E.O. No.
17, the 1987 Constitution, and Republic Act No. 6656 were already in place when
the Department of Agriculture was reorganized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As civil service employees with permanent appointments, the
petitioners could not be removed, suspended, or demoted except ‘for <u>cause</u>
provided by law.’ Since the records of this case do not show that they had been
charged and found guilty of any of the infractions listed in Executive Order
No. 17, their replacement and/or demotion in rank was unjustified and illegal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Petitioners’ positions as MAFOs were not abolished in the
‘reorganization’ process but were only rebaptized as MAOS.  Their functions, duties and stations
remained the same.  Even the number of
MAFO/MAO positions (44) was not altered.  Evidently, the so-called ‘reorganization’ was only an excuse for
reshuffling and replacing personnel in violation of the latter’s right to
security of tenure.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court GRANTS the petition and hereby sets
aside the Order dated August 31, 1988 of the Regional Director of the
Department of Agriculture, and the Resolution dated October 10, 1990 of the
Civil Service Commission, dismissing the petitioner’s appeal and ordering his
removal from the position of Municipal Agriculture and Food Officer of San
Fabian, Region I Pangasinan, pursuant to the reorganization of the Department
of Agriculture in 1987 which this Court had declared to be null and void.  Petitioner Benjamin D. Sison is ordered
reinstated to the said position, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
