A Petition assailing the Resolution of the then Court of Appeals in G. 
R. No. 54862-R, entitled Cipriano Garbo, et al., vs. Pablo Garbo, dated 
July 3, 1974, which dismissed the latter's appeal on the ground of 
failure of the Record on Appeal to show on its face that the appeal was 
perfected on time.
<p>
Following the liberalized interpretation and application of the "material data rule"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 , an outright reversal of respondent Court's Resolution is called for. 
However, there is a related question that has to be resolved, as posed 
in petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration before the Appellate Court. 
Was the judgment rendered by the Court of origin (the then Court of 
First Instance of Cebu, Branch VIII) interlocutory in character and, 
therefore, not appealable?
</p><p>
The case before the Trial Court was, one for Partition between brothers 
and sisters of a parcel of land of 2,677 sq. ms. located at Tabunok, 
Sogod, Cebu. Petitioner brother claimed exclusive ownership relying on a
 deed of sale in his favor. Private respondents, the other brothers and 
sisters, insisted on co-ownership, contending that it was their late 
father, Francisco Garbo, who had purchased the disputed property and 
that petitioner merely occupied the same in trust.
</p><p>
After hearing, the Trial Court rendered judgment, dated September 15, 1972, the dispositive portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS, this Court is 
constrained to render judgment declaring the parcel of land described in
 paragraph 2 of the amended complaint as belonging to the estate of 
Francisco Garbo. Consequently, the plaintiffs and the defendant being 
the only children of Francisco Garbo now own <em>pro indiviso</em> the 
said parcel of land in question. Hence, the complaint for partition is 
in order, and the Court now decrees that the land in question described 
in paragraph 2 of the mended complaint be subdivided and partitioned in 
equal shares among Cipriano Garbo, Eusebio Garbo, Pedro Garbo, Mariano 
Garbo, Restituto Garbo, Leonila Garbo, Anecita Garbo and Pablo Garbo, or
 to be specific into eight equal shares. Said plaintiffs and defendant 
are ordered to submit a project of partition to be approved by this 
Court within 20 days from receipt of this judgment. Should they fail to 
submit the project of partition within 20 days, the Court shall appoint a
 commissioner who will undertake the partition, the expenses of which 
shall be charged prorata against the plaintiffs and the defendant. No 
costs. </p>
  <p> SO ORDERED."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As the parties had failed to submit the Project of Partition, the Trial 
Court appointed a Commissioner who submitted his report on December 11, 
1972. On July 3, 1973, the Trial Court approved said Report over 
petitioner's objection. Peti足tioner received said Order on July 7, 1973.
</p><p>
Petitioner appealed from the judgment of September 15, 1972 by filing on
 July 16, 1973, a Notice of Appeal; on July 30, 1973, an Appeal Bond; 
and on August 1, 1973, the Record on Appeal.
</p><p>
If the Decision rendered on September 15, 1972 were final in character, 
petitioner's appeal would have been out of time as he had received the 
judgment on October 11, 1972<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  and the expiry date for interposing an appeal would then have fallen on November 10, 1972.
</p><p>
Petitioner submits that the lower Court judgment is inter足locutory and 
not appealable as something more remained to be done in the said Court 
for the complete disposition of the partition case, namely, the 
appointment of a Commissioner, the proceedings before him, the 
submission of his report, and the approval of the Project of Partition. 
In support, petitioner relied on the cases of Vda. de Zaldarriaga vs. 
Hon. Eduardo D. Enriquez, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  and the sequel case, Vda. de Zaldarriaga, et al., vs. Pedro Zaldarriaga, et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
The ruling in the cited cases, however, has been abandoned by this Court in Miranda vs. Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
 , which ex足pressly held that the general rule of partition that an 
appeal will not lie until the partition or distribution proceedings are 
terminated will not apply where appellant claims exclusive ownership of 
the whole property and denies the adverse party's right to any 
partition. This ruling was reiterated in Valdez vs. Bagaso<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  and Cease vs. Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
Herein, petitioner precisely claims exclusive ownership of the disputed property against the <em>pro indiviso</em>
 claim of private respondents. The judgment of the Trial Court declaring
 that the said property belongs to the estate of Francisco Garbo and is,
 therefore, of common ownership to be partitioned share and share alike,
 squarely resolved the very issue of ownership. It is thus a definitive 
judgment as it decided the rights of the parties upon the issue 
submitted by specifically granting the remedy sought by the action. 
Thereby, it was not an inter足locutory order but a final judgment on the 
merits.
</p><p>
Considering that petitioner, as the losing party, had failed to file his
 appeal from the judgment of September 15, 1972 of the Trial Court, 
which petitioner had received on October 11, 1972, his appeal, perfected
 only on August 1, 1973, must be held to have been filed beyond the 
reglementary period and the judgment of the Court of origin declared to 
have become final and executory.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the instant Petition is hereby dismissed, and the partition
 of the disputed property among the parties in implementation of the 
appealed judgment may now be effected. No costs.
SO ORDERED.
