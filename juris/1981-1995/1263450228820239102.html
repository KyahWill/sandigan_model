cursory reading of the record and the evidence that this is one of the cases
where the automatic review of death sentences by this Court is more than
justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an observation becomes even more
warranted considering the comprehensive and scholarly thirty-three page
manifestation of Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P.
Mendoza,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> on behalf of the People of the Philippines,
with the categorical plea that </span>the judgment of conviction <span style="">finding appellant Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span> guilty of the crime of murder and sentencing him to
death be reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that in
the past year, only in People v. <span class="SpellE">Andag</span>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> did he make such a recommendation, although

it becomes even more evident why the judgment should be reversed and the

on the part of the then trial judge, now Associate Justice of the Court of
Appeals, <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>,
the sentence certainly should have been one of acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the submission of the brief for
appellant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The records of this
case will show that the prosecution never presented a witness or witnesses
pointing to the accused as the one who killed the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did the prosecution establish the
possible motive or reason why the accused-appellant should kill the victim, who
is his compare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is significant and
highly relevant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution merely
relied on the extra-judicial confession of the accused-appellant, which as
earlier said has never been corroborated by other evidence and which confession
was secured by means of threat and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court should have acquitted the
accused of the charge of murder and should have ordered the filing of the
appropriate criminal complaint of murder against <span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span>
<span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Vidana</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidana</span>, in the
light of the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony of the accused,
<span class="SpellE">Nelia</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, the
surviving wife of the victim and the victim's uncle, Mr. Fabian Manahan, that
the three have the most possible reason or motive to kill the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span> <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> had reason or motive to kill the victim in the
face of the undeniable existing illicit relationship of his wife with <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avenge his honor, <span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span>
<span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> had to eliminate or kill <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr., to stop once and for all that amorous
relationship his wife had with the victim."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be said that necessarily <span style="">the
appellant is expected to deny his guilt and to make light of whatever evidence
may be presented against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is
true although in this particular case, portions of the testimony cited </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the brief, from the widow as well as the father of the deceased, did
cast grave doubt on the guilt of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What has an effect, conclusive in character, is the submission in the
exhaustive manifestation of Solicitor General Mendoza, with full support from
the evidence on record, that the testimony of accused-appellant of what
transpired, judged in the light of the evidence coming from prosecution
witnesses, is entitled to greater credence and belief, being more
"reasonable and believable."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Such a conclusion is
based on the following propositions:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"First:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, there
appears to be no sufficient motive for appellant to kill his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr. Instead, the three suspects, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span> <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> had strong
motive to kill the victim. * * * Second:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The nature, number and location of the wounds sustained by the victim,
as testified to by prosecution witness Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gajardo</span>,
numbering about seven, and located on the different parts of the body of the
deceased, </span>inexorably indicate that two or three, not only one,
assailants attacked the victim and inflicted the said wounds sustained by the
latter, one of which was a fracture of the parietal or temporal (back) part of
the skull * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of the
victim's death is 'cardio respiratory arrest due to shock and hemorrhage as a
result of the fracture of the skull' * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gajardo</span> concluded rightly that hard
instruments or objects were used in hitting the victim, like club, stick,
stone, bamboo club if hard, and that it was possible that two or three persons
might have assaulted and killed the victim. * * * Third:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's 'flight' to <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
and his inaction or silence before and after having witnessed the felonious
death of his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caronia</span> <span style="">Jr. </span>were
satisfactorily explained by him. * * * Fourth:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The extrajudicial confession of appellant was secured from him by<span style=""> </span>the San Mateo police investigators
under circumstances showing deceit, duress, violence, intimidation and
involuntariness, while <span style="">appellant was in
a state of fear and quandary; hence the same should </span>be rejected as void
and inadmissible. * * * Fifth:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequent develop­ments in this criminal case only serve to demonstrate
the innocence of the appellant of the crime charged against him. * * *
Sixth:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution's evidence
judicially confirms the truth of the appellant's claim of non-participation in
the commission of the crime in question and his charge against the three
suspects, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span>
<span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> as the
real culprits or killers of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is difficult to understand how, in the light of the above, the
accused was convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The explanation,
but certainly not the justification, lies in the acceptance of the version of
the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As narrated in the
decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The prosecution presented
evidence to prove that on April 29, 1978, at around 9:00 o'clock in the
morning, at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Ampid</span>, San Mateo, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, a certain Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Vidana</span>,
also of the same barrio, unearthed a dead man from a well (<span class="SpellE">balon</span>);
that Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Vidana</span> reported the matter to Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> San Jose and <span style="">Eduardo
<span class="SpellE">Ano</span>, </span>and when the policemen reached the place
they instructed Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Vidana</span> to take out the body
of the victim and they recognized the latter as that of <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr., who had been missing since April 20, 1978
in the evening; that the policemen investigated the surroundings and there they
saw a piece of bamboo and a big stone (<span class="SpellE">malaking</span> <span class="SpellE">bato</span>) near a hut not far from the place where they
unearthed the body of the victim; that they learned that the owner of the said
hut (<span class="SpellE">kubo</span>) was Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span>,
a friend and <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span> of the victim; that said
Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span> was not in his house, neither was he
in any part of San Mateo, but they were informed that he left for <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, his hometown; that Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Ano</span>, together with Patrolman Gonzalo <span class="SpellE">Dandalo</span>
went to <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and there they found Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span>; that outright, Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span>
admitted having killed <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>,
Jr., and burying his body not far from his hut on the 20th of April, 1978, at
11:30, more or less in the evening; that upon reaching San Mateo, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the accused Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span>
executed an extra-judicial statement before Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Ano</span>,
at the Police Headquarters, stating the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">inaamin</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span> <span class="SpellE">naman</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">pumatay</span> <span class="SpellE">kay</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr.' * * *; that
<span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>, a resident
of Bo. <span class="SpellE">Ampid</span>, San Mateo, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
knows the victim, <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>,
<span style="">Jr., </span>and testified that on the
night of April 20, 1978, between the hours of 9:00 and 10:00 o'clock, he saw
the victim and the accused together enjoying a drink at <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
Vita's Store of said barrio and he was offered a glass of gin; that after
drinking, <span style="">he </span>left and promised
to be back after taking home the two women companions; that he returned as
promised but on the way he met the victim and the accused going out of the
store, so they walked all together until they reached the approach of the
bridge (<span class="SpellE">puno</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">tulay</span>) of <span class="SpellE">Ampid</span> where he
separated from the two and the latter entered the way to <span class="SpellE">Pag-asa</span>
Compound leading to the hut of the accused <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span>; that
after that incident he did not see the victim any­more and he was informed that
the victim was missing since that evening of April 20, 1978, together with the
accused; that later, on April 29, 1978, he learned and saw the body of <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, <span style="">Jr., </span>dug out from a well (<span class="SpellE">balon</span>)."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reference is <span style="">made anew </span>to
what was stated in the brief for accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two prosecution witnesses, the two
closest <span style="">relatives </span><span style="">of </span>the victim, the widow and the
father, absolved the accused-appellant of the crime imputed to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the private prosecutor, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Eleazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Castillano</span>, moved for the
dismissal of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Immediately after the defense rested
its case, private prosecutor Atty. <span class="SpellE">Castillano</span> orally
moved for the dismissal of the case and the acquittal of the accused Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span> of the crime charged, stating that the antecedent
facts and circumstances as revealed by the evidence adduced during the trial
point clearly to <span style="">the </span>three
persons, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span>
<span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> as the
real malefactors who feloniously killed the victim, <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr.; that the three suspects have a motive
to kill the victim; while the accused Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span>
had none; and that the accused Federico <span class="SpellE">Cuison</span> is a
victim of frame-up * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time,
Fiscal Angeles opposed the manifestation and motion of private prosecutor Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Castillano</span>, for being made without his prior
permission, and he insisted on the conviction of the accused based on the
evidence adduced by the prosecution * * *, but he did not touch on the evidence
introduced by the prosecution which tended to absolve the accused of the crime
charged."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Had there been greater
care shown by the trial judge, certainly the judgment could not have been one
of conviction, much </span>less <span style="">one
imposing the death penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To reiterate
what was set forth at the beginning, such judgment must be reversed and the
accused </span><span style="">acquitted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. To repeat, the constitutional presumption of innocence had not
been overcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to view the
actuation of the trial judge as well as of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span>
Angeles charitably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is need to
stress anew that both the prosecuting arm of the government and, equally so,
trial courts should be ever alert lest in their desire to see that a crime be
properly punished, the wrath of the law falls on one whose offense had not been
duly proved and therefore convicted without due process of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
As so well put in the Manifestation of the Solicitor General:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“We have shown above that the prosecution
witnesses themselves, no less than the widow, father and uncle of the victim,
testified to an incident wherein <span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span> <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> almost caught both the deceased <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr. and his (<span class="SpellE">Emeterio's</span>) wife in love tryst at the house of the
appellant, thus proving that the three suspects have a strong motive to kill
the victim pursuant to their criminal conspiracy to make the victim pay for his
misdeed (<span class="SpellE">atraso</span>), while a co-detainee of the
appellant testified to the continuing threat of <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> against appellant to kill him and his family
if ever he would squeal on them as the killers of his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span>
* * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing declarations of
said prosecution witnesses, which are adverse to the prosecution's cause,
confirm the version of the defense as to how <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr. was killed feloniously by the above-named
three suspects, as testified to by appellant * * *, which he further explained
in detail in his second written statement given to Pat. Ernesto Garcia, police
investigator of the San Mateo Police <span style="">Department,
on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="7"><span style="">July 28, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">
* * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the trial
fiscal, State Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> Angeles, who was
present throughout the proceedings of this criminal case in the court below,
never objected to the presentation of the above-named four prosecution witnesses
and to their adverse declarations in court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And there is no showing why their declarations in open court may be
doubted or vitiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the
case, the prosecution is bound by the declaration of its own witnesses which
tended to absolve appellant of the crime charged, thus rendering the
prosecution's cause, as tes­tified to only by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ano</span>,
weak and unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, private prosecutor Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eleazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Castillano</span>, after the defense rested its case, found the
prosecution's evidence weak and doubtful that there and then in open court he
orally moved for the dismissal of the criminal case or for the acquittal of the
appellant of the crime charged, stating that the evidence adduced during the
trial clearly reveal that three persons, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magtanggol</span> <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> are the real
malefactors who conspired in killing the victim <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr.; that the three suspects have the strong
motive, while appellant has none, to kill the victim; and that appellant is a
victim of a frame-up * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is
true that the private prosecutor did not have the prior permission or authority
from the trial fiscal to make the manifestation and motion to dismiss or to
acquit the appellant * * *, yet the trial fiscal, in opposing the private
prosecutor's motion, did not touch on the evidence introduced by the
prosecution which tended to absolve the appellant of the crime charged.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It suffices to recall
People v. <span class="SpellE">Dramayo</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus: "Accusation is not, according to
the fundamental law, synonymous with guilt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is incumbent on the prosecution to demonstrate that culpability
lies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants were not even called
upon then to offer evidence on their behalf.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their freedom is forfeit only if the requisite quantum of proof
necessary for conviction be in existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their guilt must be shown beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To such a standard, this Court has always
been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is need therefore,
for the most careful scrutiny of the testimony of the state, both oral and
documentary, independently of whatever defense is offered by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only if the judge below and thereafter the
appellate tribunal could arrive at a conclusion that the crime had been
committed precisely by the person </span><span style="">on
</span><span style="">trial under such an exacting
test should the sentence be one of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is thus required that every circumstance favoring his innocence be
duly taken into account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof
against him must survive the test of reason; the strongest suspicion must not
be permitted to sway judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
conscience must be satisfied that on the defendant could be laid the
responsibility for the offense charged; that not only did he perpetrate the act
but that it amounted to a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
required then is moral certainty."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. The trial judge, in arriving at the sentence of conviction,
made much of the alleged extra-judicial confession by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference to the manifestation of the
Solicitor General is enough to demonstrate why such should not have been the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The extrajudicial confession in
legal contemplation is worthless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
there is need to stress that both the prosecuting arm and trial judges must not
disregard the authoritative pronouncements of this Tribunal on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, the manifestation of the
Solicitor General had this to say:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It should be stressed here that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ano</span>
was also not telling the truth when he declared that appellant verbally
admitted to them while they were still in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
that he killed his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr. Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ano</span> could
not decide when appellant made the verbal admission:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether on the occasion immediately when they
found him inside a house at San Jacinto, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
or inside the jeep during their trip back to San Mateo from <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
* * *. Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ano</span> himself admitted in his testimony
that appellant, despite their asking questions why he killed his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span>, merely begged of them:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">sabi</span> <span class="SpellE">niya</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>
Headquarters <span class="SpellE">daw</span> <span class="SpellE">siya</span> <span class="SpellE">magpapa­liwanag</span>' * * *; thus appellant did not make any
verbal admission at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
he told the police investigators who found him in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
that he did not kill his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span>, and that he could
not tell them the real culprits at that time because <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> (who made the threat to kill him and his
family if he would squeal on them) was present, who came along with the police
investigators to <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter, therefore, is that
appellant merely pleaded with the police investigators who saw him in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> that he be allowed to explain at the police
headquarters in San Mateo, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the reasons why he
came to and hid in San Jacinto, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> after he
had witnessed the felonious killing of his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span>
in the late evening of April 20, 1978 in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Ampid</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Mateo</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when they arrived at San Mateo, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on that day, April 29, 1978, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> was always seen with the police investigators
when the latter were questioning him * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, appellant decided to remain tight-lipped regarding the
circumstances surrounding the death of his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="5" month="5">May
 5, 1978</st1:date> when he was being questioned by the police investigators,
he refused to admit having something to do with the killing of his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to the appellant, police investigators Pat. Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Ano</span>
and Pat. Ernesto Garcia inflicted acts of violence upon his body (<span class="SpellE">binugbog</span>), which caused him to make the verbal admission
that he killed his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span> * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is perhaps the verbal admission referred
to by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ano</span> in his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came the day, <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1978</st1:date>, for the taking of appellant's
extrajudicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Earlier during
the said day, appellant was warned by <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> when the latter went to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
cell at the municipal jail of San Mateo, reminding him of his previous threat *
* * And even before the formal investigation could start, appellant saw <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span> inside the
investigation room at the police headquarters, together with the police
investigators, and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span>
approached him and whispered to him that if he would squeal or point on them as
the killers of his <span class="SpellE">kumpadre</span>, the three of them would
kidnap him * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides the presence
of <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vidania</span>,
appellant had the misfortune of being assisted by a lawyer whose interest was
adverse to his (appellant's) cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat.
<span class="SpellE">Ano</span> declared that appellant had a lawyer by the name
of <span style="">Atty. Juan Moreno of San Mateo, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, during the investigation; that he saw Atty. Moreno
and the appellant talk to each other three times; that it was Atty. Moreno,
after talking to the appellant, who announced that they could start the
investigation; and that he was sure Atty. Moreno was assisting the appellant
during the investigation as the latter's counsel * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Atty. Juan Moreno, testifying as a
defense witness, declared that he was the private prosecutor during the
preliminary investigation before the municipal court of the very criminal
complaint against appellant for the murder of <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr. * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Sr., father of the <span style="">said deceased, testifying as a prosecution witness, Atty. Juan Moreno
was their lawyer involving the case of the felonious death of his son before
the municipal court, and that Atty. Moreno was already handling the case of his
son when he (Atty. Moreno) went to the police headquarters of San Mateo * *
*.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite this conflict of interest,
Atty. Moreno admitted in open court that he used to visit the appellant at the
jail of San Mateo during the time he was the private prosecutor of the case
against the appellant * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ano</span> claimed that all his questions asked of the appellant,
which became the basis of the latter's extrajudicial confession * * *, were
freely answered by the appellant in the presence of Atty. Moreno * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Atty. Moreno contradicted or debunked
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ano's</span> claim, saying that he (Atty. Moreno) was
present only before the formal investigation started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted having talked to the appellant
who told him (Atty. Moreno) that he (appellant) preferred to declare before the
judge in open court; hence, he left the investigating room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not, Atty. </span>Moreno maintained,
present when appellant's extrajudicial confession was being reduced to writing.
* * * Under the foregoing circumstances, appellant then had no alternative but to
make his forced, but still qualified confession, * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More revealing are certain features of the
extrajudicial confession * * * which render the same of doubtful validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the clear and emphatic answer of the
appellant to the third question, wherein he pleaded that he be allowed instead
to tell everything before a judge or court, the police investigators should
have stopped there and then the taking of his written confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the police investigators insisted on
making him say something about the verbal admission appellant had made the
previous day after he was subjected to bodily harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the fourth question was asked, and the
appellant, still nurturing the fear of the threats from the suspects and the
bodily harm that may <span style="">again be inflicted
upon him by his police tormentors, reiterated his previous short verbal
admission, if only to put a stop or end to the investigation right there and
then * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no eyewitness
to the killing, if they have zeroed their suspicion upon the appellant as the
culprit, the police investigators should have asked from the appellant and
included in the said extrajudicial confession, the background and surrounding
circumstances, motive, and other facts involving the felonious death of <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Coronia</span>, Jr. and
appellant's flight to <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's extrajudicial confession * * *
lacks the details of the killing of the victim as well as the burying of the
latter's dead body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the joint
police affidavit or report of police investigators Pat. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">San Jose</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ano</span> * * *
is absent of these important and necessary details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By itself, the extrajudicial confession * * *
does not provide the reasons and circumstances to convince a magistrate with an
impartial mind to conclude that appellant is guilty of the crime charged beyond
</span>reasonable doubt."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
A confession of that character, to repeat, is not deserving of any
credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reliance of the trial
judge therefore on such an alleged admission was misplaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He failed to accord deference to what has
been the unbroken rule in this jurisdiction from the case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> v. <span class="SpellE">delos</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1913 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A later case, People v.
<span class="SpellE">Bagasala</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
speaks to this effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Certainly,
however, where the confession is involuntary, being due to maltreatment or
induced by fear or intimidation, there is a violation of this constitutional
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any form of coercion, whether
physical, mental, or emotional thus stamps it with inadmissibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is essential for its validity is that it
proceeds from the free will of the person confessing."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
What was said later in the opinion is quite appropriate for the manner the
trial judge discharged his function:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"It is unfortunate that the lower court failed to abide by the
authoritative doctrines that ban the use of involuntary confessions in
accordance with the constitutional provision against self-incrimination which,
in the language of Justice Sanchez, should be 'mandatory', being 'a valuable
and substantial right.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, too:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The above testimony
notwithstanding, the lower court could still look upon such confession as free
of any infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, that was
error, as pointed out by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
constant course of decisions of this honorable Tribunal, true to the meaning of
the self-incrimination clause, forbids the admission of any confession obtained
under such circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be to
render nugatory a valuable constitutional right if judges of the courts of
first instance display less than full sensitivity to its command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conviction resting on such proof, and such
proof alone, certainly cannot be allowed to stand."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>
