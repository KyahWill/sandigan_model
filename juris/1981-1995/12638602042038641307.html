<p class="BODY">What transpired on that fateful night, as culled from the

at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening, <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaog</span>
saw three (3) men (the herein appellants) coming out of the house of <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Quingquing</span> (the herein
victim).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellants were dragging a
person whom he (<span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaog</span>)
recognized as the victim (TSN, May 5, 1983, pp. 12 and 14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The victim was bleeding (TSN, Dec. 3, 1982, p. 10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was on the ground (on her back) while her
two arms were held by <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>,
who was dragging her out of the house (TSN, Dec. 3, 1982, p. 12).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, Oscar <span class="SpellE">Rabino</span>
stood at the feet of the victim, while <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> stood at the victim's side (TSN, Dec. 3, 1982, p.
12).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellants stopped dragging the
victim three (3) meters away from her house (TSN, May 5, 1983, p. 15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There, he (<span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manaog</span>) heard the victim pleading for mercy but she
was ignored by appellants (TSN, Dec. 3, 1982, p. 13; TSN, May 5, 1983, p. 14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Instead, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
asked the victim "Where is Angeles, where is Angeles?" <span class="GramE">(TSN, Dec. 3, 1982, p. 13).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>
was then armed with an Indian arrow while <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> and Oscar <span class="SpellE">Rabino</span> had
bolos tucked on their waists (TSN, May 5, 1983, p. 3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim did not answer (TSN, Dec. 3, 1982,
p. 13).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few moments after the victim
was asked where her son Angeles <span class="SpellE">Quingquing</span> was, she
died (TSN, Dec. 3, 1982, p. 13).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants carried her body away from her house (TSN, May 5, 1983, p.
17; Oct. 30, 1981, p. 4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>When Angeles <span class="SpellE">Quingquing</span> arrived at around
<st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1981</st1:date>, he looked for his
mother (<span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Quingquing</span>)
who he found was not inside the house (TSN, Oct. 27, 1983, p. 6).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He saw the victim lying dead on the pathway,
about 50 meters from their house, <u>with</u> <u>an</u> <u>Indian</u> <u>arrow</u>
<u>embedded</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>left</u> <u>side</u> <u>of</u> <u>her</u>
<u>back</u> (TSN, Oct. 27, 1983, p. 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly, Angeles <span class="SpellE">Quingquing</span> heard Oscar <span class="SpellE">Rabino</span> say: "Angeles is here already, he will be the
next one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>We</u> <u>will</u>

about 300 meters away from the crime scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Together, Angeles <span class="SpellE">Quingquing</span>, his sister and
his brother-in-law went back to where the victim was, but appellants were no
longer there (TSN, Nov. 18, 1983, pp. 5-6).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His brother-in-law then went to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain to report the incident (TSN, Nov. 18, 1983, p. 6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>An autopsy was conducted by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Damiana</span> <span class="SpellE">Claveria</span>, Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Buhi</span>,

victim's body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Wound No. (1) <span class="GramE">was</span> a punctured wound located in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">left </span>armpit caused by a sharp pointed and small instrument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other wounds were abrasions caused by
friction against a rough surface (TSN, August 28, 1981, pp. 5-8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The punctured wound (Wound No. 1), according
to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Claveria</span>, would cause the death of the victim
one (1) hour after its infliction (TSN, Aug. 28, 1981, p. 8).</blockquote>

March 26, 1981), <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span>

convicted on the basis of circumstantial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No direct evidence was adduced to prove that
they were the ones who killed <span class="SpellE">Ignacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Quingquing</span>, as no witness testified to the actual

such closeness and coordination indicative of a common purpose [People v. <span class="SpellE">Petenia</span>, G.R. No. 51256, August 12, 1986, 143 SCRA 361.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the act of one in killing the victim becomes the

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellants
assail the alleged reliance of the trial court on the extrajudicial confession
of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span> which they
claim was extracted without observance of the requirements laid down by the
Court in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Galit</u></span> G.R.
No. 51770, March 20, 1985, 135 SCRA 465].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, they contend, the confession is inadmissible in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">however, </span>is
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in agreement </span>with the Solicitor
General's view that the <span class="SpellE">admissibilty</span> of the

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court's
rejection of the defense of alibi, which accused-appellants assail, is in
accord with the facts and the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alibi is an inherently weak defense as it is so easy to fabricate
[People v. <span class="SpellE">Badilla</span>, 48 Phil. 718 (1926).] Thus, it
cannot prevail over positive identification [U.S v. Garcia, 9 Phil. 434 (1907);
People v. <span class="SpellE">Ocaya</span>, G.R. No. 75074, <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1986</st1:date>, 144 SCRA 165.] It is settled
that for such defense to prosper it must be shown that it was physically
impossible for the accused to have been at the scene of the crime or at the
vicinity thereof at the time it was committed [People v. <span class="SpellE">Oxiles</span>,
29 Phil. 587 (1915); People v. Coronado, G.R. No. 68932, October 28, 1986, 145
SCRA 250; People v. <span class="SpellE">Detuya</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-39300, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 30, 1987</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 154 SCRA
410.]</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the defense of alibi raised by the accused
is unavailing in the light of their positive identification by witness <span class="SpellE">Plaridel</span> <span class="SpellE">Manaog</span> [TSN, <st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 10-14.]
Moreover, it has been established that the houses of the accused and the scene
were only a short distance apart and were in fact in the same <span class="SpellE"><u>barangay</u></span> [TSN, November 20, 1984, pp. 9-10; October
7, 1985, pp. 9-10.] It was therefore not impossible for the accused to have
been at the scene of the crime at the moment of its commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>However, the Court finds
that the trial court's conclusion that accused-appellants are guilty of murder,
the crime charged<span class="GramE">,</span> does not find support in the
established facts and the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
no evidence to show that treachery and/or evident premeditation, the qualifying
circumstances alleged in the information, attended the commission of the
crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that the
circumstances that would qualify the crime to murder have to be proven as indubitably
as the crime itself [People v. Vicente, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-31725, </span><st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 18, 1986</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 141 SCRA 347, citing </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"> v.

<span class="SpellE">Bisandre</span>, 40 Phil. 78 (1919).]</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>the
absence of any qualifying circumstances, the crime committed was only <span class="GramE">homicide</span> [Art. 249, Revised Penal Code.]</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Also, the circumstance
of abuse of superior strength [Art. 14. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">para</span></span>.
15, Revised Penal Code], which was alleged as an aggravating circumstance in
the information, cannot be appreciated in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For superior strength to qualify or aggravate
a crime, it must be clearly shown that there was deliberate intent to take
advantage of it [People v. <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bello</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18792, </span><st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 28, 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 10 SCRA 298.]</span> In the instant case, there is no evidence to
show that the accused purposely sought to use their superior strength to their
advantage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in the absence of
direct evidence on how the killing was actually done, the actual participation
of each accused in the killing and who actually inflicted the fatal wound, a
finding that there was abuse of superior strength cannot be sustained [People
v. <span class="SpellE">Tulagan</span>, G.R. No. 68620, July 22, 1986, 143 SCRA
107.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither may <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> [Art. 14, <span class="SpellE">para</span>. 6 of the Revised Penal Code] be considered to
aggravate the crime because, as correctly held by the trial court, the
prosecution failed to show that the accused purposely sought to commit the
crime at nighttime in order to facilitate the achievement of their objective,
prevent discovery or evade capture [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 38.]</p>
