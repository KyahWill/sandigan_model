nullify the order, dated February 11, 1983, of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
(First Division) in Criminal Case No. 6672, entitled "People vs. Modesto <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span> y <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, et al.,"
ordering the discharge upon motion of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>,
of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>
from the information for robbery to be utilized as a government witness and the
order, dated March 21, 1983, denying the motion for reconsideration; and (2) to
enjoin respondents from presenting him as state witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1982</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> City Branch of the Central Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was robbed and divested of cash amounting to P19<span class="GramE">,731,320.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="9" year="1982">June 9, 1982</st1:date>,
a sizable portion of the money was recovered at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Home</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Savings Bank &amp; Trust Company</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
after a raid by the police authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 6, 1982, the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> filed
an information with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> charging
Modesto <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, Leo Flores, Ramon Dolor, <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balansin</span>, Rolando <span class="SpellE">Quejada</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span>
Flores, Mario Lopez Vito and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, as
principals, and herein private respondent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B.
<span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, as accessory, with the crime of robbery
committed on or about June 5 and 6, 1982 at the <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
City Branch of the Central Bank of the Philippines in which P19<span class="GramE">,731,320.00</span> was taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.
The National Bureau of Investigation which investigated the case recommended
that <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span> be
charged as principal but the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> included him
only as an accessory after the fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1982</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> filed <span class="GramE">an amended</span>
information in naming the same persons as principals, except Rogelio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz who is now charged as an accessory, together with
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="11" day="29" year="1982">November 29, 1982</st1:date>,
the accused were arraigned, including private respondent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, who interposed the plea of not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="7" year="1983">January 7, 1983</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> filed with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
a "Motion for Discharge" of accused <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span> to be utilized as state witness, alleging
that all the requisites prescribed in Section 9, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court
have been fully complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for discharge was opposed by herein petitioner Leo
Flores, on the ground that the bare assertions of the prosecution (1) that there
is absolute necessity for the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>; (2) that there is no other direct
evidence available for the proper prosecution of the offense charged except his
testimony; and (3) that his testimony can be substantially corroborated in its
material points, are all self-serving allegations which are not substantiated.
Further, petitioner Flores claims that from the records of the preliminary
investigation of the robbery case conducted by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span> appears
to be the <span class="GramE">most guilty</span> and is, in fact, the mastermind
in the commission of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1983">February 11, 1983</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> issued a resolution granting the
motion and ordering the discharge from the information of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>. Petitioner <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>
filed a motion for reconsideration but the same was denied in the court's
resolution dated <st1:date month="3" day="21" year="1983">March 21, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 9, Rule 119 of the Revised Rules of Court, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 9 <u>Discharge of one of several defendants to be
witness for the prosecution</u>. - When two or more persons are charged with
the commission of a certain offense, the competent court, at any time before
they have entered upon their defense, may direct one or more of them to be
discharged with the latter's consent that he or they may be witnesses for the
government when in the judgment of the court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>There is absolute
necessity for the testimony of the defendant whose discharge is requested;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>There is no other direct evidence available
for the proper prosecution of the offense committed, except the tes­timony of
said defendant;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of said defendant can be
substantially corroborated in its material points;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">d</span>)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Said defendant does
not appear to be the most guilty;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">e</span>)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Said defendant has
not at any time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent from this rule that the discharge of an accused
from the information so that he may be utilized as a state witness is the
exclusive responsibility of the trial court provided that it sees to it that
the requisites prescribed by the rules exist, particularly the requisite that
there is absolute necessity for the testimony of the defendant whose discharge
is requested. Under this requisite, the fiscal must show that there is absolute
necessity for the testimony of the defendant whose discharge he seeks, in order
to be a witness for to prosecution. This requirement is aimed to curtail
miscarriage of justice, before too common, through the abuse of the power to
ask for the discharge of one more defendants. Absolute necessity of the
testimony of the defendant, whose discharge is <span class="GramE">requested</span>
must now be show if the discharge is to be allowed, and the power to determine
the necessity is lodged upon the court. (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>,
92 Phil. 933). The expedient should be availed of, only when there is absolute
necessity for the testimony of the accused whose discharge is requested, <u>as
when he alone has knowledge of the crime</u>, and not when his testimony would
simply corroborate or otherwise strengthen the evidence in the hands of the
prosecution (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> 106 Phil. 1111).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that the contents of the affidavit dated June
14, 1982, of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, which in all probability would be the nature of
his testimony as a state witness, is not absolutely neces­sary if the purpose
is to pinpoint the role of petitioner Modesto <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>
considering the other evidence submitted by the National Bureau of
Investigation to the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>, like the affidavits
executed by the three (3) Security Guards of the Home Savings Bank, namely:
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Pomada</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aranillo</span> and Elias <span class="SpellE">Gellecanao</span>
mentioning petitioner Modesto <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>. Thus,
petitioners contend that there can be no basis for the prosecution "to
honestly assert that there is absolute necessity for the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span> for the
purpose of establishing the participation of Modesto <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>
in delivering the money to the Home Savings Bank. At most, the intended
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>
is only corroborative of the statements of the other witnesses submitted by the
NBI to the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>." (p. 17, Memorandum for
Petitioners)</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the discharge of an accused may be ordered "at
any time before they (defendants) have entered upon their defense," that
is, at any stage of the proceedings, from the filing of the information to the
time the defense starts to offer any evidence. In the case at bar, considering
the opposition of herein petitioners to the motion for the discharge of <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, particularly
the contention that he (herein private respondent) is the most guilty and that
his testimony is not absolutely necessary, the trial court should have held in
abeyance or deferred its resolution on the motion until after the prosecution
has presented all its other evidence. Thereafter, it can fully determine
whether the requisites prescribed in Section 9, Rule 119 of the New Rules of
Court, are fully complied with. Besides, there lies the danger where one or
more of the defendants are discharged before the commencement of the hearing,
he/they may disappear in which case the purpose of his/their exclusion will
come to naught. It is necessary that certain safeguards be <span class="GramE">taken,</span>
otherwise an injustice may be committed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the resolution of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, dated February 11, 1983, ordering the
discharge from the information of accused <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B.
<span class="SpellE">Licaros</span> in Criminal Case No. 6672, as well as its
resolution, dated March 21, 1983, denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration,
are hereby SET ASIDE.</p>
