<p class="BODY">In the <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="1">18 January 1988</st1:date>
elections, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> B. PEÑAFLORIDA and
private respondent Ramon D. DUREMDES were the contending Vice-gubernatorial
candidates for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PEÑAFLORIDA was the official candidate of the
<span class="SpellE">Lakas</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Bansa</span> (<span class="SpellE">Lakas</span>), while DUREMDES was
the official candidate for the Liberal Party (LP) and PDP-<span class="SpellE">Laban</span>
coalition.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the canvass of votes by the Provincial Board of Canvassers
of <span style="">Iloilo </span>(PBC) from 20 to <st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="1">31 January 1988</st1:date>, PEÑAFLORIDA objected
to some 110 election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PBC
overruled the objections and ordered their inclusion in the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="1">29 January 1988</st1:date>,
PEÑAFLORIDA appealed to the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) and prayed for the
<u>exclusion</u> of the same returns and his proclamation <span style="">as </span>the elected Vice-Governor of
Iloilo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day after, on <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="1">30 January 1988</st1:date>, PEÑAFLORIDA filed
with the COMELEC a Petition seeking the annulment of those election returns and
the suspension of the proclamation of any candidate.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="1">31 January 1988</st1:date>,
however, the PBC proclaimed DUREMDES as the duly elected Vice-Governor together
with the duly elected Governor and only eight (8) members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglalawigan</span> of <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DUREMDES was certified to have garnered
157,361 votes representing the number of his uncontested votes in 2,377
precincts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="2" month="2">2 February 1988</st1:date>,
DUREMDES took his oath and assumed office.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="9">20 September 1988</st1:date>,
the COMELEC (Second Division) upheld the rulings of the PBC <span style="">as </span>well as DUREMDES' proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same Resolution directed the PBC to
immediately reconvene and <u>to</u> <u><span style="">include</span></u>
in the canvass the questioned election returns and thereafter to proclaim the
winning candidate for the ninth (9th) and tenth (10th) slots for the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Panglalawigan</span></span><span style=""> </span>of
<st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="9">27 September 1988</st1:date>,
the COMELEC (Second Division) certified the case to the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u> when PEÑAFLORIDA moved for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="12">15 December 1988</st1:date>,
the date of the proclamation of the ninth (9th) and tenth (10th) placers of the
<span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglalawigan</span>,
the Chairman of the PBC openly admitted the existence of discrepancies between

questioned election returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="1">12 January 1989</st1:date>,
the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u>
rendered <span class="GramE">a <u><span style="">per</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>curiam</u></span></span>

<p class="BODY">His proclamation having been nullified by the COMELEC, and
charging grave abuse of discretion by said body, DUREMDES availed of a Petition
for <i>Certiorari</i> in G.R. <span style="">Nos. </span>86362-63,
<u>supra</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="10">27 October 1989</st1:date>,
this Court upheld the COMELEC decision after finding that DUREMDES'
proclamation was based on an incomplete canvass because of the non-inclusion of
the questioned election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court stated <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">That discrepancies</span> exist between the
entries in the Statement of Votes and those reflected in the questioned
election returns, was openly admitted by the Chairman of the Board of
Canvassers at the scheduled promulgation on <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="12">15 December 1988</st1:date> of the 9th and 10th placers of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> (p. 6,
COMELEC Decision).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, it is
also admitted by the parties except that PEÑAFLORIDA assails the correctness of
the Statement of Votes, while DUREMDES maintains its correctness but avers the
possibility of the tampering of the questioned election returns (p. 7, ibid.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="20" month="1">20 January 1990</st1:date>,
DUREMDES' Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="13" month="3">13 March 1990</st1:date>,
the PBC reconvened as directed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
because it was following the procedure prescribed in Section 245 of the Omnibus
Election Code by entertaining verbal and written objections and thereafter
ruling thereon, PEÑAFLORIDA questioned the applicability of said provision
before the COMELEC on <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="3">14 March 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="18" month="5">18 May 1990</st1:date>,
the COMELEC released an Order informing the parties that:</p>

<blockquote>"The Commission <u>en banc</u> will conduct physical
examination of the questioned election returns (PBC copy and other election
returns copy) on <st1:date year="1990" day="23" month="5">23 May 1990</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 P.M.</st1:time></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The parties may attend the opening of the questioned
election returns on the date and time aforementioned</u>." (Emphasis
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon <span class="SpellE">PEÑAFLORIDA's</span> Motion, the physical
examination of the questioned election returns was re-scheduled on <st1:date year="1990" day="29" month="5">29 May 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day before, however, or on <st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="5">28 May 1990</st1:date>, PEÑAFLORIDA instituted
before this Court:</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Peñaflorida</u></span><u> v. COMELEC</u> (Second Petition)
(G.R. No. 93376, July 19, 1990)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That was a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i>
seeking primarily to prohibit the COMELEC from making any physical examination
of the questioned contested returns and to direct the PBC to "<u>simply</u>
<u>include</u>" in the canvass of votes for Vice Governor of Iloilo the
results reflected in the contested returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court restrained the physical examination temporarily.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that this time, PEÑAFLORIDA sought the <u>inclusion</u>
of the contested returns contrary to his position in January 1988 asking for
their <u>exclusion</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="19" month="7">19 July 1990</st1:date>,
this Court upheld the COMELEC Order and mandated:</p>

<blockquote>"The COMELEC is DIRECTED to proceed with dispatch to the
physical examination of the questioned election returns so that the true will
of the electorate of <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>, in so
far as the vice-gubernatorial position is concerned, may be determined at the
earliest possible time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Temporary
Restraining Order heretofore issued is LIFTED.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> "</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Further, the Court found:</p>

<blockquote>"The necessity of a comparison of the several copies of the
election returns is highlighted by the fact that the parties have failed to
pinpoint which exactly are the questioned election returns, there being
instances where the several copies of those returns do not tally with one
another."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The reconsideration requested by PEÑAFLORIDA was denied with
finality in our Resolution of <st1:date year="1990" day="29" month="11">29
 November 1990</st1:date>, wherein we stated, in part:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As
correctly stated by the Solicitor General, the said physical examination will
consist only of a <u>simple comparison between the different copies of the
questioned election returns</u> in order to determine the correctness of the
entries in the Statement of Votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
purpose of said examination is merely to put to rest any controversy as to the
number of votes actually received by each candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> ."</span>
(Underscoring supplied). </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In an Order, dated 18 December 1990, and pursuant to this Court's
directive to "proceed with dispatch" with the physical examination of
the questioned election returns in G.R. No. 93376 (the Second Petition), the
COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> set, on 20 December 1990, the physical
examination of the election returns in question and ordered the production of
the PBC copy and the other five (5) copies of the questioned election returns
in the scheduled examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
Division Clerk of Court was also ordered to notify the parties of this incident</u>
(Annex C, Petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 December 1990, the <span style="">COMELEC
</span><u>en banc</u> convened, but reset the examination the following day, 21
December 1990, "considering that there are still necessary steps to be
taken in order to produce all the election returns subject of the canvass"
(Annex D, ibid.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="12">21 December 1990</st1:date>,
the COMELEC again convened and commenced the examination of the contested
election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both parties were not
in attendance as it appears that they received copies of the Order only on <st1:date year="1990" day="22" month="12">22 December 1990</st1:date>, or a day after the
scheduled examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of
material time, however, the continuation of the examination of the election
returns <span style="">was </span>set on <st1:date year="1991" day="3" month="1">3 January 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Clerk of Court <span style="">was </span><span style="">again </span>"<u>directed
to issue proper notification to all concerned</u>" (Annex E, ibid.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="3" month="1">3 January 1991</st1:date>,
the COMELEC continued its examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only <span style="">DUREMDES </span>was <span style="">said </span>to be in attendance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an Order, dated <st1:date year="1991" day="4" month="1">4
 January 1991</st1:date>, the <span style="">COMELEC </span>manifested
its intention "to terminate as soon as possible the comparison of the
different available copies of the contested election returns," and for
that purpose set the examination dates daily on 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of
January 1991.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The parties were
ordered to be notified accordingly</u> (Annex F, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PEÑAFLORIDA received a copy of the Order on <st1:date year="1991" day="5" month="1">5 January 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also admits that he was notified by
telephone through counsel that the examination was on-going and that he may
attend the <span style="">same </span>(Petition, pars.
7, 8, 1, p. 25).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="11" month="1">11 January 1991</st1:date>,
PENAFLORIDA filed before the COMELEC an "Urgent Motion to Set Aside
Proceedings," setting the same for hearing on <st1:date year="1991" day="17" month="1">17 January 1991</st1:date> <span style="">(Annex G</span>, Petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="14" month="1">14 January 1991</st1:date>,
the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> <span class="GramE">convened,</span> saw fit to
act on said Motion earlier than the date set by PEÑAFLORIDA, and to deny the
same for being "devoid of merit." At the same time, it proceeded with
the examinations <span style="">as </span>scheduled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order clearly stated, however, that <u>the
parties may attend succeeding examinations upon prior notice of the proceedings
to be conducted by the Commission</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Annex A, ibid.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="17" month="1">17 January 1991</st1:date>,
the COMELEC issued an Order setting forth the completion of the physical
examination of the contested election returns but reset the same to <st1:date year="1991" day="21" month="1">21 January 1991</st1:date> for the Commissioners
<span style="">who </span>had not finished with their
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order likewise directed
the Clerk of Court <span style="">to </span>notify the
Commissioners "<u>and parties concerned to be present during said schedule</u>."

v. COMELEC, PBC and <span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span></u> (G.R. No. 96760)
(This Petition [the third])</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="24" month="1">24 January 1991</st1:date>,
PEÑAFLORIDA filed the present Petition, the third that has reached this Court
involving the vice-gubernatorial race in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>,
praying primarily that all proceedings conducted by the COMELEC commencing <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="12">21 December 1990</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">relative</span>
to the physical examination of the contested election returns, be declared null
and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our Resolution, dated <st1:date year="1991" day="29" month="1">29
 January 1991</st1:date>, respondents were <span style="">ordered </span>to c<span style="">omment on </span>the
Petition, with which directive they have complied.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the interim, on <st1:date year="1991" day="11" month="2">11
 February 1991</st1:date>, the COMELEC completed the physical examination and
comparison of the questioned election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It found that of the 110 questioned election returns in nine (9)
municipalities of Iloilo, 49 returns from four (4) municipalities, namely, <span class="SpellE">Guimbal</span> (25 precincts), <span class="SpellE">Oton</span> (8
precincts), San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> (5 precincts), and <span class="SpellE">Ajuy</span> (11 precincts), had been "systematically
tampered" with or substituted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, with respect to said 49 questioned returns, the <span style="">COMELEC </span>ordered that the <span style="">COMELEC </span>copy or Ballot Box copy of said
election returns be used for canvassing, instead of the usual PBC copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PBC was also ordered to convene within
five (5) days from notification and to complete the canvass, utilizing for the
purpose, PBC copies for those precincts the returns of which were not <span class="GramE">questioned,</span> and for those which were, such election returns,
per precinct, as specified in the Order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon <span class="SpellE">PEÑAFLORIDA's</span> "Most Urgent
Motion," the Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order on 14 February
1991, "ordering the COMELEC to Cease and Desist from enforcing its
Resolution (Order) dated February 11, 1991 in SPC No. 88-448 and respondent
Provincial Board of Canvassers of Iloilo to Cease and Desist from implementing
said COMELEC Resolution (Order)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was also set for oral argument on <st1:date year="1991" day="21" month="2">21 February 1991</st1:date>, with the Court having been
particularly interested in determining the basis of the COMELEC in the
selection of the copies of the election returns to be used in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the hearing, Memoranda were required of
the parties, the last to be submitted having been included in the Agenda of the
Court <u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style=""> </span>on <st1:date year="1991" day="19" month="3">19 March 1991</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his present Petition, PEÑAFLORIDA contends that the COMELEC
had acted with grave abuse of discretion in conducting examinations without
proper notice to him and without his participation, thereby rendering said
proceedings invalid for having been conducted contrary to the basic precepts of
procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a subsidiary
issue, he also attributes grave abuse of discretion to the COMELEC for having
denied his "Urgent Motion to Set Aside Proceedings" without affording
him a chance to be heard.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">PEÑAFLORIDA's</span> protestations are
unconvincing.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the physical examination of the questioned election returns <span style="">was </span>conducted without proper notice <span style="">to </span>him is not borne out by the
records.</p>

<p class="BODY">Except for the fact that PEÑAFLORIDA (and DUREMDES for that
matter) was not notified on time of the opening of <span style="">ballot boxes </span>and the commencement of the physical <span style="">examination </span>set for 21 December 1990,
having received the notice <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> only on 22
December 1990, the records disclose that PEÑAFLORIDA received previous notice
of all the other scheduled dates of examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, no substantial prejudice actually
resulted from his non-attendance on <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="12">21
 December 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PBC
copies of the questioned election returns opened and examined on said date were
found to be genuine and, therefore, non-controversial.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the examination on <st1:date year="1991" day="3" month="1">3 January 1991</st1:date>, PEÑAFLORIDA admits having received notice
thereof the day before, or on <st1:date year="1991" day="2" month="1">2 January
 1991</st1:date> (Petition, pp. 11-12).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, <span style="">as </span>early as <st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="12">28 December 1990</st1:date>, he had been served
a copy of <span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span>' "Supplemental Motion"
which made reference to the examination scheduled on said date (<span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span> Comment, p. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, PEÑAFLORIDA had also received a copy of the COMELEC
Order, dated <st1:date year="1991" day="4" month="1">4 January 1991</st1:date>,
on <st1:date year="1991" day="5" month="1">5 January 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Order set the examination of the
questioned election returns daily from 14 January to <st1:date year="1991" day="18" month="1">18 January 1991</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span>
Comment, p. 5).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That the examination was
conducted without <span class="SpellE">PEÑAFLORIDA's</span> participation was
through no fault of the </span><span style="">COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Even if, as PEÑAFLORIDA contends, the
COMELEC never intended to involve the parties, the records disclose that the
examination was not conducted "privately" as PEÑAFLORIDA alleges and
that the COMELEC had always included in its Orders directives to notify the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, PEÑAFLORIDA was duly
notified of the dates of examination, except for that of <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="12">21 December 1990</st1:date>, but for reasons of his own, he
chose not to attend the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He moved
instead to annul the examinations below and opted to rely <span style="">on </span>this Petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">was
</span>never "excluded" from participation nor was there any attempt
on the part of the COMELEC <span style="">to </span>do
so, as he alleges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His present plaint is
the result of his own omission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">PEÑAFLORIDA further
asserts, however, that the "fair and reasonable procedure" adopted by
the COMELEC in the examination of the twenty one (21) contested election
returns in the "Mountain Province Cases" was not adopted in the
present one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Culled from those suits,
that procedure may be outlined briefly as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">From the records of this case and the oral arguments of the parties,
we find that, except for the late notification to the parties of the physical
examination on <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="12">21 December 1990</st1:date>,
which they received only the day after, there has been no departure from said
prescribed procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far back <span style="">as </span>its Order of 18 May 1990, followed
by its subsequent Orders, dated 18 December 1990 (Annex C, Petition), 21
December 1990 (Annex E, ibid.), 4 January 1991 (Annex F, ibid.), and 14 January
1991 (Annex 2, <span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span> Comment), the COMELEC had
consistently required notification to the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If PEÑAFLORIDA had attended, he could have
observed the physical examination proceedings, but he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must, therefore, be deemed to have
forfeited the opportunity given him, pursuant to notice, to "conduct his
own examination of each and every page of the returns in question and to submit
a formal summary of his observations" (Step 2, above).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, the presence of a party is not
always the essence of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
enough that a party has been given notice and an opportunity to be heard (see <span class="SpellE">Asprec</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Itchon</span>, G.R. No.
L-21685, 30 April 1966, 16 SCRA 921; <span class="SpellE">Var</span>-Orient
Shipping Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Achacoso</span>, G.R. No. 81805, 31
May 1988, 161 SCRA 732).</p>

<p class="BODY">Steps 3 and 4 are addressed to the COMELEC Commissioners and have
also been complied with <span style="">as </span>disclosed
in the COMELEC Orders, dated 20 December 1990 (Annex D, Petition), 21 December
1990 (Annex E, ibid.), and 4 January 1991 (Annex F, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing to stop the Commissioners
from holding executive sessions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>likewise of
significance to note that the Mountain Province Cases involved the knotty
question of exclusion and inclusion <span style="">of </span>election
returns originating from the Provincial Board of Canvassers level up to the
COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, this Court
circumscribed the extent of the physical examination to be conducted in this
case <span style="">as </span>a summary one, i.e., <span style="">a “</span>simple comparison between the
different copies of the questioned election returns" (G.R. No. 93376, 29
November 1990), and to determine the copy to be used in the canvass of the votes
previously ordained by the COMELEC and upheld by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said physical examination was rendered necessary in order to
determine the genuineness and authenticity of the contested election returns in
view of the discrepancies that were found to exist between the entries in the
Statement of Votes and those reflected in the questioned election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those discrepancies were admitted by the
Chairman of the Board of Canvassers himself at the scheduled promulgation on <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="12">15 December 1988</st1:date> of the 9th and 10th
placers of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglalawigan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we stated in G.R. No. 93376, <st1:date year="1990" day="19" month="7">19 July, 1990</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"Since discrepancies admittedly exist between the Statements
of Votes and the questioned election returns, a physical examination of those
returns including a comparison with other copies thereof is in order with a
view to settling once and for all wherein those variances lie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specially so, in view of the conflicting
positions taken by the parties, with petitioner assailing the correctness of
the Statement of Votes, and <span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span> maintaining its
accuracy but suggesting the possibility of tampering of the questioned election
returns."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By that physical examination, the true and accurate number of
votes cast in favor of each candidate, as reflected in the various copies of
the election returns, can be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
will put to rest any controversy as to the number of votes actually received by
each candidate per precinct and will make possible an accurate tally in the Statement
of Votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accuracy is imperative because
the election returns constitute the basis of the Statement of Votes which, in
turn, supports the Certificate of Canvass on the basis of which a proclamation
is made (Sec. 231, 2nd par., Omnibus Election Code)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The additional records now before us (Annexes 32 and 33, <span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span> Memorandum) further disclose that in a verified
report, dated 19 January 1989, by the Vice Chairman of the Provincial Board of
Canvassers to Hon. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Davide</span>,
Jr., then Chairman of the COMELEC, the former disclosed that the election
returns collected by one Atty. Aurelio Ignacio, Chairman of the PBC of Iloilo,
and submitted to said Vice-Chairman on 5 January 1988, were found to have been
flagrantly substituted, and that the collection of the election returns by said
Atty. Ignacio was done by him alone in the absence of other designated
officials despite previous arrangements to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it was that Congressman Oscar G. <span class="SpellE">Garin</span>,
in his "deep concern for the sanctity of our electoral process generally
and more specifically for the sake of maintaining the integrity of the results
of the local elections held on January 18, 1988, in my hometown of <span class="SpellE">Guimbal</span>, Iloilo," called the attention of the COMELEC
officially in his letter, dated 12 January 1989, regarding the conduct of said
Atty. Ignacio, and suggested that "in order to arrive at the ultimate
truth as to the exact number of votes each vice gubernatorial candidate
obtained in the questioned precincts, the ballot boxes corresponding to these
precincts be opened and the election returns therein deposited be made the
basis of the <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> and if need be the ballots
themselves be again appreciated and counted" (Annex J, Petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the COMELEC saw fit to act on said
letter <span style="">in </span>its Resolution of <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="1">16 January 1989</st1:date> (Annex 32, <span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span> Memorandum) and <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="3">14 March 1990</st1:date> (Annex K, Petition) <span style="">is </span>no cause for suspicion as PEÑAFLORIDA would seem to
insinuate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the COMELEC
was duty bound to act thereon, <span style="">as </span>it
did, when it relieved Atty. Ignacio of his position as Chairman of the PBC and
appointed another in his stead (Annex 32, <span class="SpellE">Duremdes</span>
Memorandum).</p>

<p class="BODY">The results of the physical examination of the five (5) copies of
the contested election returns already conducted and terminated by the COMELEC <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> tellingly confirm the need <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">PBC's</span>,
Municipal Judge's and Treasurer's copies of the questioned returns in
forty-nine (49) precincts were found to be fake or substituted copies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In some precincts, the PBC copies were found
to have been systematically tampered with and no longer reflected the true
results of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, where
those infirmities were proven, the COMELEC <span style="">was </span>left with no alternative but to order that the COMELEC copy
or ballot box copy of said election returns, all of which were found to be
genuine and authentic, be used for canvassing, instead of the usual PBC
copy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, it will be noted that
where the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> found the PBC copies to be authentic,
they were also ordered to be used in the canvass (COMELEC Order, 11 February
1991).</p>

<p class="BODY">The examination of copies of election returns, other than the PBC
copy, may not be commonly done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
given the ample power of the COMELEC to enforce and administer all laws
relative to the conduct of elections, it should be allowed to take such
measures as it may deem necessary in the exercise of those powers, with a view
to ensuring that the true will of the electorate is known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the conduct of physical examination
was affirmed by this Court in G.<span style="">R. No.
93376, <u>supra</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the subsidiary issue that <span class="SpellE">PEÑAFLORIDA's</span>
"Urgent Motion to Set Aside Proceedings" <span style="">was </span>brushed aside by the COMELEC without due hearing, again, that
was within its discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 6,
Rule 11, of the COMELEC Rules on Procedure provides:</p>

<blockquote>"No oral argument shall be heard in support of motions unless,
for special reasons, the Commission or Division directs otherwise."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that the COMELEC saw no "special reason"
for setting <span class="SpellE">PEÑAFLORIDA's</span> aforesaid Motion for
hearing on the date he had indicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This could have meant the cancellation of the scheduled dates of the
physical examination of the questioned election returns, earlier set daily from
14 January to <st1:date year="1991" day="18" month="1">18 January 1991</st1:date>,
notice of which <span style="">was </span>duly
furnished him, and the COMELEC, justifiably, wanted to avoid unnecessary
delays.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, after having filed said Motion, PEÑAFLORIDA had no right
to assume that the same would be granted, or to be absent, or to <span style="">shy </span>away from the proceedings (<span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> v. Court of Tax
Appeals, L-28782, 12 September 1974, 59 SCRA 110; Eden v. Minister of Labor and
Employment, G.R. No. 72145, 28 February 1990, 182 SCRA 840).</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, due process has been accorded PEÑAFLORIDA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">No undue haste, nor</span>
grave abuse of discretion may be attributed to the COMELEC in issuing its
questioned Orders of 14 January and <st1:date year="1991" day="11" month="2">11
 February 1991</st1:date> in SPC No. 88-448.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, it was merely complying with the directive of this Court to
"<span class="GramE">proceed</span> with dispatch to the physical
examination of the questioned election returns so that the true will of the
electorate of <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>, insofar as
the vice-gubernatorial position is concerned, may be determined at the earliest
possible time.” <span class="GramE">(G.R. No. 93376, <span class="SpellE">Peñaflorida</span>
v. COMELEC et al., 19 July 1990).</span></p>
