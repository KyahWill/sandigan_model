trial on the merits ensued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the day

</span>On the same day, that is, <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="2">23

which was likewise denied by the trial court on <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="3">18 March 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="3">29 March 1977</st1:date>,
the trial court promulgated a decision against the defendants<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
who acknowledged receipt of the decision on <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4">1 April 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
motion (petition) for relief from judgment was filed on <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="4">22 April 1977</st1:date><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court denied the same on the ground that
it lacked an affidavit of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="5">17 May 1977</st1:date>, petitioners filed an
alternative motion (a) for reconsideration of the order denying motion

of original motion (petition) for relief, <span class="SpellE">refiled</span>

respondent, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> issued an order of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners have come to this Court on a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
raising the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> committed error
in declaring the case submitted for decision for failure of the defendants
(petitioners herein) and their counsel to appear on the scheduled date of
trial;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> committed error
in rendering a decision not based on the issue agreed upon by all parties at
the pre trial hearing; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> committed error
in denying the second motion for reconsideration and thereafter ordering the
execution of the judgment, when in fact the original motion (petition) for
relief from judgment, with an affidavit of merit and proof of service thereof,
was <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period provided by the Rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in this petition.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin with, we find no error committed by
the respondent court in issuing the order considering the case submitted for
decision for failure of the petitioners (as defendants) and their counsel to
appear at the scheduled date of trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, it should be noted that a motion for reconsideration was filed
by petitioners without delay and, upon its <span class="GramE">denial,</span> a
second motion for reconsideration was again filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first motion for reconsideration, counsel for petitioners
gave a reasonable explanation for his nonappearance in court on the scheduled
date of trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He explained that, on the
day of the trial, he had a slight attack of <span class="SpellE">ashtma</span> and
had to rest for some fifteen (15) to twenty (20) minutes, that when he arrived
in court at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 a.m.</st1:time>, the
respondent court had already given the order considering the case submitted for
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court, however, denied the
motion for reconsideration, even after finding the nonappearance of defendants'
counsel justified, because "there is no justification whatsoever for the
absence and nonappearance of the defendants themselves"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second motion for reconsideration, counsel for petitioners
alleged that one of the defendants was with him at the time he arrived late (on
the scheduled date of trial).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
same second motion for reconsideration, counsel made a notation that said
motion will be submitted to the court for consideration, at which time, further
explanation will be given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, on
the day set for the hearing of said second motion, counsel for petitioners
again failed to appear, for which reason, the respondent court denied said
second motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the motion (petition) for relief from judgment, petitioners'
counsel apologized to the court for his nonappearance at the hearing of the
second motion for reconsideration, alleging that, on the same day, he was in
Branch II of the Court and that the arguments and deliberations of a case in
said other branch dragged for more than one hour and that, by the time he
arrived in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of respondent court, he was
informed that the court had already called the case and had declared the second
motion for reconsideration submitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the non-appearance of counsel for petitioners at the
scheduled date of trial as not intended to delay the disposition of the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the happening of an event
beyond his control - the asthma attack - that forced his absence from court at
the start of such scheduled trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
counsel for petitioners exerted efforts to correct any wrong impression caused
by his absence at the scheduled hearing, by filing a motion for reconsideration
without delay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court
should not have applied the rules too strictly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The interest of justice would have been better served if petitioners had
been given their day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners should also not be made to suffer because of minor
lapses in the diligent attendance of their counsel, for they are entitled to be
protected in the vindication of their rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is to be noted that one of the defendants was with their counsel when
the latter arrived late on the scheduled date of trial on account of an asthma
attack.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>At the pre-trial of the
case in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, the following facts were agreed upon by
both parties, <u>as</u> <u>proven</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the two parcels, namely, that which is
claimed by the plaintiffs and that which is claimed by the defendants,
originally belonged to one, <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> (now deceased) who was the legitimate father of Juan
<span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said two parcels of land were sold by
said <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> to <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcallas</span> (now deceased husband of defendant Petra <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcallas</span>)
on <st1:date year="1952" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1952</st1:date> under a
public instrument duly registered with the Register of Deeds for <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1967</st1:date>; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the parcel claimed by the plaintiffs
was purchased by said plaintiffs from Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>,
legitimate son of said <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>,
under a public instrument on July 17, 1967 and duly registered with the same
Office of the Register of Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> on June 4,
1967; and that same parcel was donated to said Juan by his father <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span> in consideration of Juan's marriage sometime in or
before 1951"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, as the respondent court itself said, "if such
donation is not preponderantly proven by evidence, therefore, the claim of the
plaintiffs must necessarily fail, considering that they admit that the
aforesaid two parcels of land originally belonged to <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> and then the latter sold the same to the
defendants on August 26, 1952, so that the subsequent sale of that portion of
the land by Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> to them (plaintiffs) must <span class="SpellE">necesarily</span> be <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if it can be proven by
them (plaintiffs) by means of indubitable documents or evidence that said
parcels were donated to them (actually, Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>)
under donation <span class="SpellE"><u>propter</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>nuptias</u></span>
in or about 1951, then their (<span class="SpellE">plaintiffs's</span>) claim
must succeed"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the parties agreed to simplify the issue for resolution, as
-</p>

<blockquote>"WHETHER OR NOT THE SAID PORTION SOLD BY JUAN PANGAN TO THE
PLAINTIFFS ON JULY 17, 1967 WAS PREVIOUSLY A SUBJECT MATTER OF A VALID DONATION
<u>PROPTER</u> <u>NUPTIAS</u> BY TIBURCIO PANGAN IN FAVOR OF HIS LEGITIMATE SON
JUAN PANGAN, IN CONSIDERATION OF THE LATTER'S MARRIAGE SOMETIME IN OR BEFORE
1951"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the now assailed decision, the respondent court declared the
plaintiff as the owner of the land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In arriving at this conclusion, the court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The land in question was originally owned by Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> who sold the same to plaintiff Esteban <span class="SpellE">Tojong</span> as evidenced by Exhibit A, a written deed of sale of
said land notarized by notary public <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
document was registered with the corresponding register of deeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the execution of said deed of sale,
vendee, <span class="SpellE">Estaban</span> <span class="SpellE">Tojong</span>
procured that its tax declaration which was then in the name of vendor Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> be transferred in the name of the plaintiff-vendee,
as per Exhibit C, Land Tax Declaration No. <span class="GramE">R-21792 in the
name of Esteban <span class="SpellE">Tojong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span>
L. <span class="SpellE">Tojong</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From and after the transfer of the tax declarations of said land in the
name of the plaintiffs, the latter have been paying the taxes thereon as
evidenced by Exhibit D payment of taxes for 1973; Exhibits D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4,
D-5 and D-6, receipts of taxes for the years 1972, 1971, 1970, 1969, 1968,
1967, 1966 and 1965, respectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the Martial Law regime pursuant to the revision of
land declarations, the tax declaration of said land was further revised as
evidenced by Exhibit C-2, true copy of Tax Declaration No. D-10465 in the name
of <span class="GramE">spouses</span> plaintiffs Esteban <span class="SpellE">Tojong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Aurea</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Tojong</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before the land in question was sold to the plaintiffs by its
original owner, Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>, the latter mortgaged
said land to the Philippine National Bank to secure a loan he obtained from
said bank sometime in November 1966 as evidenced by Exhibit C, promissory note
of Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> in favor of the Philippine National
Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After they purchased said land,
plaintiffs had this mortgage released.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs took actual possession of said land from Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> in 1967 and while plaintiffs were in possession of
said land defendants, by means of force and without justification therefore
entered upon said land and occupied the same to the exclusion of and damage to
the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So that the plaintiffs
in this pray that judgment <span class="GramE">be</span> rendered declaring them
owner in fee simple of the land in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It having been established by the evidence on record that the
land in question was originally owned by Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>
who had been in continuous, peaceful possession of the same as an owner for
more than ten years and that Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> sold the
same to the herein plaintiffs for a valid and sufficient consideration, the
Court believes and so holds that said land is owned by the plaintiffs in fee
simple x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be gleaned from the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
decision, the respondent court did not rule on the sole issue in the case as
agreed upon by all the parties during the pre-trial conference.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the court assumed the prior
ownership of Juan <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span> over the disputed land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And yet, under Section 4, Rule 20 of the
Rules of Court, admissions during the pre-trial conference bind all the parties
and the court, unless modified upon request before trial to prevent manifest
injustice.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 3, Rule 38 of
the Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 3.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Time for filing petition; contents and verification.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- A petition provided for in either of the
preceding sections of this rule must be verified, filed within sixty (60) days
after the petitioner learns of the judgment, order, or other proceeding to be
set aside, and not more than six (6) months after such judgment or order was
entered, or such proceeding was taken; and must be accompanied with affidavits
showing the fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence relied upon, and
the facts constituting the petitioner's good and substantial cause of action or
defense, as the case may be.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the petitioners' motion (petition) for
relief from judgment was filed on time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To recapitulate, upon receipt on <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4">1
 April 1977</st1:date> of the adverse decision dated <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="3">29 March 1977</st1:date>, petitioners filed on <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="4">22 April 1977</st1:date> a verified motion
(petition) for relief from judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
was denied by the court because the said motion (petition) lacked an affidavit
of merit as required by the Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, on <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="5">17 May <span class="GramE">1977</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> and still within
the sixty (60) day period from the time petitioners received the adverse
decision and within six (6) months from the date of entry of said adverse
decision of <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="3">29 March 1977</st1:date>,
petitioners re-filed the motion (petition) for relief from judgment together
with an affidavit of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In denying
the motion (petition) of petitioners, dated <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="5">17 May 1977</st1:date>, the lower court clearly committed a
reversible error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the petition for relief was filed within the
prescribed period and that the herein petitioners appear to have a meritorious
and plausible defense, the respondent judge should have ordered the reopening
of the case for the reception of defendants' evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The orders of the respondent Judge issued on <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="2">23 February 1977</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="3">14 March 1977</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="3">18 March 1977</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="6">1 June 1977</st1:date> as well as the decision rendered on <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="3">29 March <span class="GramE">1977</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> are hereby annulled and set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge, or his successor, is
