				<BR><STRONG>NARVASA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The special civil action of <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>at
bar was instituted in this Court to annul an order rendered by the Regional
Trial Court at <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City, Branch 129, in a
prosecution for arson docketed in that Court as Criminal Case No. 28820 (87).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused in that case of arson is <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
L. <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the prosecution's theory that<span style="">
</span>he <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> caused the fire in the early
morning of May 21, 1987 which totally burned and destroyed the second and third
floors of the <i>"I </i><i><span style="">Love </span>You
</i><i><span style="">Restaurant and </span>Sauna </i><i><span style="">Bath"</span></i><span style=""> </span>owned by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> L. Tan, located at
No. 2 L. <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span>
<span style="">City.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Among the witnesses presented by the Government to demonstrate <span class="SpellE">Sembrano's</span> culpability was Benjamin Lee, a room boy of the
restaurant and bath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lee testified on
direct examination at the hearing of December 8, 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony was essentially that <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> had run out of the VIP room where the fire had
started and refused to heed his (Lee's) call to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lee took the witness stand again on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1987</st1:date> during which he was
cross-examined by defense counsel, gave additional evidence on redirect <span style="">examination, was again questioned on <span class="SpellE">recross</span>-examination by the same defense counsel, and
thereafter allowed to step down.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution completed presentation of its evidence-in-­chief
in due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But before it could rest
its case, and two (2) months or so after Benjamin Lee had completed his
testimony, the <span style="">defendant's original
counsel, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Formoso</span>, withdrew his appearance
and was substituted by another attorney, Eduardo S. Rodriguez.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The latter then filed a motion on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="6"><span style="">June 8,
 1988</span></st1:date><span style=""> to recall
Benjamin Lee for further examination.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The ground relied upon by Atty. Rodriguez
was simply that after he had reviewed the record of Benjamin Lee's testimony,
he came to the conclusion that </span><i>"there seems </i><i><span style="">to </span>be </i><i><span style="">many </span>points and questions </i><i><span style="">that should </span>have been asked but were not <span class="SpellE">profounded</span>
(sic) by the other defense </i><i><span style="">counsel
</span>who conducted ** (the </i><i><span style="">cross-examination)."</span></i><span style=""> It was on this averment, and counsel's
reference to "the gravity of the offense charge (sic)" and the need
"to afford the accused full opportunity to defend himself," that
Lee's recall for further cross examination was sought to be justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over objections of the prosecution, the Court</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> granted the motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Efforts were thereafter exerted to cause witness Benjamin Lee to
again appear before the Court for further cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These efforts met with no success; and the
trial had to be postponed several times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appears that Lee had terminated his employment and moved elsewhere without
indicating his new address.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">So, on October 1, 1990 the private prosecutor filed a
"Manifestation and Motion" drawing attention to the inability to
procure the re-appearance of witness Lee for which "the prosecution could
not be held liable," and to the fact that "Lee has already been
thoroughly examined by the former defense counsel," and praying upon these
premises "that the further examination of Benjamin Lee be dispensed with
and ** the prosecution ** allowed to terminate the presentation of its evidence."</p>

<p class="BODY">By Order dated <st1:date year="1990" day="2" month="10">October
 2, 1990</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the Trial Court denied the motion to dispense with the recall of Benjamin
Lee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it ordered "the
testimony of Benjamin Lee for the prosecution ** stricken off the record for
lack of complete cross-examination" because the witness could no longer be
found, and "the failure of counsel for the accused to further
cross-examine the witness is not the fault of the defense."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the same order, the Court also set the "reception of
further evidence for the prosecution, if any, ** on <st1:date year="1990" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1990</st1:date> ** as earlier scheduled."
Subsequently it denied the private prosecutor's motion for reconsideration of
the order.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the action at bar, instituted by the Office of the Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">The writ of <i>certiorari</i> prayed for will issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Trial Court acted with grave abuse of
discretion in authorizing the recall of witness Benjamin Lee over the
objections of the prosecution, and in later striking out said witness'
testimony for want of further cross-examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that a Trial Court has discretion to grant
leave for the recall of a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is clear from a reading of Section 9, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, as
amended,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<i>viz</i>.:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i><span style="">Recalling witness</span></i><span style="">. -- </span>After the examination of a witness
by both sides has been concluded, the witness cannot be recalled without leave
of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court will grant or
withhold leave in its discretion, as the interests of justice may
require."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">But obviously that discretion may not be
exercised in a vacuum, as it were, entirely isolated from a particular set of
attendant circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discretion
to recall a witness is not properly invoked or exercisable by an applicant's
mere general statement that there is a need to recall a witness "in the
interest of justice," or "in order to afford a party full opportunity
to present his case," or that, as here, <i><span style="">"there seems to be many points </span>and </i><i><span style="">questions that should have been asked"</span></i><span style=""> </span>in the earlier interrogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To regard expressed generalities such as
these as sufficient ground for recall of witnesses would make the recall of a
witness no longer discretionary but ministerial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something more than the bare assertion of the
need to propound additional questions is essential before the Court's
discretion may rightfully be exercised to grant or deny recall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a satisfactory showing of some
concrete, substantial ground for the recall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There must be a satisfactory showing on the <span class="SpellE">movant's</span>
part, for instance, that particularly identified material points were not
covered in the cross-examination, or that particularly described vital
documents were not presented to the witness whose recall is prayed for, or that
the cross-examination was conducted in so inept a manner as to result in a
virtual absence thereof. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Absent such
particulars, to repeat, there would be no foundation for a trial court to
authorize the recall of any witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the respondent Trial Court granted the
defendant's motion for recall on nothing more than said <span class="SpellE">movant's</span>
general claim that certain questions -- <i>unspecified</i>, it must be stressed
-- had to be asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In doing so it acted
without basis, exercised power whimsically or capriciously, and gravely abused
its discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">So, too, the respondent Court acted whimsically, capriciously,
and oppressively, in other words, gravely abused its discretion, in ordering
the striking out of the entire testimony of Benjamin Lee after it appeared that
he could no longer be found and produced for further examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the Court acted
unilaterally, without any motion to this effect <span style="">by </span>the defense and thus without according the prosecution a
prior opportunity to show why the striking out <span style="">should </span>not be decreed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More importantly, the striking out was directed without any showing
whatever by the defense of the indispensability of further cross-examination,
what it was that would have been elicited by further cross-examination
rendering valueless all that the witness had previously stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be stressed that Lee was subjected
both to cross-examination and <span class="SpellE">recross</span>-examination by
former counsel of the accused <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously the latter was satisfied that there
had been sufficient cross-examination of the witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absence of cross-examination may not
therefore be invoked as ground to strike out Lee's testimony (as being
hearsay).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there is no showing
whatever in this case that it was the prosecution that placed the witness
beyond the reach of the Court, much less of the expected nature or tenor of his
additional testimony which, because not presented, would necessarily cause the
evidence earlier given by Lee to become hearsay or otherwise incompetent, and
therefore amenable to being stricken from the record.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED and the respondent Court's
challenged Order dated <st1:date year="1990" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1990</st1:date>
is NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE, with costs against private respondent.</p>
