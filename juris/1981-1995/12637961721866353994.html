appealed from holding the plaintiff Jose D. Calderon (petitioner herein) and
his bondsman the Integrated Bonding and Insurance Com­pany, Inc., jointly and
severally liable to pay defendants (private respondents herein), damages caused
by the filing by Calderon of the allegedly unwarranted suit and the wrong<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ful and malicious attachment of private
respondents' properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The facts of the case are
briefly as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1976</st1:date>,
petitioner Calderon purchased from the private respondents the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Luzon Brokerage Corporation (LBC, for
brevity) and its five (5) affiliate companies, namely - Luzon Air Freight,
Inc., Luzon Port Terminals Services, Inc., Luzon (GS) Warehousing Corporation,
GS Industrial Management Corporation, and GS Luzon Trucking Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Twenty one (21) days there­after or on <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1976</st1:date>, the Bureau of
Customs suspen­ded the operations of LBC for failure to pay the amount of
P1,475,840.00 representing customs taxes and duties incurred prior to the
execution of the sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to lift
the suspension, Calderon paid the sum of P606,430.00 to the Bureau of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1977</st1:date>,
Calderon filed a complaint against private respondents to recover said amount
of P1,475,840.00, with damages by reason of breach of warranty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same complaint, the petitioner prayed
for a preliminary attach­ment, alleging:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>that private respondents had deliberately and willfully concealed from
his knowledge such staggering liability of the LBC for the purpose of
misleading him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">into buying the six
aforesaid companies; and that private respondent Schulze is about to depart
from the Philippines in order to defraud his creditors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To support the petition for preliminary attachment, the
petitioner posted a surety bond of P1,475,840.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1977</st1:date>, the trial court issued a writ of preliminary attachment,
whereupon properties of the private respondents were attached and their bank
deposits were garnished.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1977</st1:date>,
petitioner Calderon filed an amended complaint, alleging that while the
liabilities of LBC are reflected in its books, the aforesaid amount was
fraudulently withdrawn and misappropriated by private respondent Schulze.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 7-18, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the other hand,
private respondents claimed:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the
amount of P1,475,840.00 due to the Bureau of Customs represents the duties and
taxes payable out of the advanced payments made by <span class="SpellE">LBC's</span>
client, Philippine Refining Company (PRC, for brevity) in August, September and
October, 1976, and in the first and second weeks of November 1976, after
Calderon himself had taken control of the management of LBC (Exhibit A); that
these deposit payments were properly recorded in the books of the corporation
and existing as part of the corporate funds; that from the first week of June,
1976 up to October 30, 1976, private respondent Schulze fully disclosed and
explained to Calderon that these customer's advanced deposit payments (including
those </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:35.0pt">of</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the PRC) are to be paid to the Bureau of
Customs when </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">their corresponding
customs taxes and duties become due; that during this phase of the negotiation,
Calderon and his representatives inspected and studied the corporate books and
records at will and learned the daily operations and management of </span>LBC; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that the petitioner did not pay out of his
own pocket but out of the LBC funds the said amount of P606,430.30 demanded by
the Bureau of Customs, as evidenced by a manager's check No. FEBTC 25092
(Exhibits 9, 10, 11 &amp; 38) and another facility negotiated with the Insular
Bank of Asia and America (Exhibit K-2); and that private respondents are
setting up a counterclaim for act­ual, moral and exemplary damages as well as
attorney's fees, as a consequence of the filing of the baseless suit and the
wrongful and malicious attachment of their proper</span>ties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 217-221, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1977</st1:date>,
private respondents filed a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>, whereupon
the trial court issued an order directing the sheriff to return all real and
personal pro­perties already levied upon and to lift the notices of garnishment
issued in connection with the said attachment (Annex B, p. 42, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the trial court dismissed the complaint, holding
Calderon and his surety First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Co., Inc.,
jointly and severally liable to pay the damages prayed for by the private
respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Said decision was
affirmed on appeal, although slightly modified in the sense that the award of
moral and exemplary damages in favor of private respondents Schulze and <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> </span>was reduced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the judgment of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> and modification reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment of the lower court is modified as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>To defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> George Schulze:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All other dispositions in the judgment ap­pealed from,
including the dismissal of the amen­ded complaint, are hereby affirmed <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his petition, petitioner Calderon asserts, among other things,
that the court below erred:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>IN HOLDING THAT THE PETITIONER FAILED TO ESTABLISH HIS CLAIMS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>IN HOLDING THAT THE PRELIMINARY ATTACHMENT HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY AND
MALICIOUSLY SUED OUT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>IN HOLDING THAT THE PETITIONER IS LIABLE NOT ONLY FOR ACTUAL
DAMAGES BUT MORAL AND EXEM­PLARY DAMAGES AS WELL.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner Insurance Company raises the
following issues:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE PETITIONER SURETY IS LIABLE FOR DAMAGES ON ITS
CONTRACTED SURETYSHIP NOTWITHSTANDING THE DISSOLUTION OF THE WRIT OF
PRELIMINARY ATTACHMENT, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FILING OF THE DEFENDANT'S
COUNTER-BOND, WHEREBY LEVIED PROPERTIES WERE ORDERED BY THE COURT RE<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">TURNED TO PRIVATE RESPONDENTS AND THE NOTICES
OF GARNISHMENT ISSUED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ORDERED LIFTED.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE SUBSEQUENT FILING BY PRIVATE RESPONDENTS OF A
COUNTER-BOND TO DISCHARGE THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY ATTACHMENT CONSTITUTE A
WAIVER ON ANY DEFECT IN THE ISSUANCE OF THE ATTACHMENT WRIT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT A SURETY IS A GUARANTOR OF THE EXISTENCE OF A GOOD
CAUSE OF ACTION IN THE COMPLAINT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The petition is devoid of
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Whether or not the amount
of P1,475,840.00 was duly disclosed as an outstanding liability of LBC or was
mis­appropriated by private respondent Schulze is purely a factual issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That Calderon was clearly in bad faith </span>when
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">he asked for the attachment is
indicated by the fact that he failed to appear in court to support his charge
of misappropriation by Schulze, and in effect, preventing his being
cross-examined, no document on the charges was presented by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">What the Appellate Court
found in this regard need not be further elaborated upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Appellate Court ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"xxx The record shows that appellant
Calderon failed to produce any evidence in support of his sworn charge that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Schulze had deliberately and willfully concealed
the liabilities of Luzon Brokerage Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither did appellant Calderon prove his sworn charges that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Schulze had maliciously and fraudulently withdrawn
and misappropriated the amount of P1,475,840.00 and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt">all </span>the defendants had mali­ciously
and fraudulently concealed and withheld from him this alleged liability of
Luzon Brokerage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Corporation in breach
of the contract-warranty that said corporation had no obligations or liabi­lities
except those appearing in the books and records of the said corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, appel­lant Calderon never appeared in
the trial court to substantiate the charges in his verified com­plaints and in
his affidavit to support his petition for the issuance of a writ of
attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He distanced himself from
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and avoi­ded cross-examination
regarding his sworn allega­tions. xxx<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx But even though appellant Calderon failed to prove his
serious charges of fraud, malice and bad faith, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
took it upon themselves to show that they did not conceal or withhold from
appellant's knowledge the depo­sits made by Philippine Refining Co., Inc. with
Luzon Brokerage Corporation and that they did not withdraw and misappropriate
the deposits made by Philippine Refining Co., Inc. with Luzon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Brokerage Corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“The books and records of Luzon Brokerage Corporation on which the
Financial Statement of Luzon Brokerage Corporation, as of October 31, 1976 was
prepared by the auditing firm re­tained by appellant Calderon himself (Exhibit
1), disclose that the liabilities of Luzon Broker­age Corporation in the total
amount of P4,574,498.32 appear under the heading 'Customers Depo­sit' (Exhibit
1-A) this amount includes the depo­sit of Philippine Refining Co., Inc. in the
sum of P1,475,840.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But appellant Calderon contends that this financial statement
was dated <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1977</st1:date>
(see Exhibit 1-C).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
commendable in this argument because the bases of the finan­cial statement were
the books, records and docu­ments of Luzon Brokerage Corporation for the period
ending <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1976</st1:date>,
which were all turned over to and examined by appellant Calderon and his
executive, legal and financial staffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is also no merit in the contention of appel­lant Calderon that the
<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> have tampered the books of Luzon Brokerage
Corporation because there is no proof to back this charge, let alone the fact
that appellant Calderon did not even present the said books to support his
charge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As stated above, the amount of customers' deposits in the sum
of P4,574,498.32 includes the deposits of Philippine Refining Co., Inc.
(Exhibits 46-A, 46-B, 46-C, 46-D, 46-E, 46-F, 46-G, 46-H, 46-I, 46-J, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. July 23, 1980, pp. 12-13, 14-15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amounts deposited by Philippine Refining
Co., Inc. on various dated with Luzon Brokerage Corporation made before <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the execution of the sale were all entered in
three other corporate books of Luzon Brokerage Corporation namely, the <u>Cash</u>
<u>Receipts</u> <u>Register</u> (Exhibits 39-A-1 to 39-K-1 and 39-A-1-B to 39-
K-1-B), the <u>Journal</u> <u>Vouchers</u> (Exhibits 42 to 46 and 42-A to
45-A), and the <u>Customer's</u> <u>Deposit</u> <u>Ledger</u> (Exhibits 46-A to
46-J) xxx.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, the claim of appellant Calderon that the deposits made by
Philippine Refining Co., Inc. with Luzon Brokerage Corporation of P406,430.00
on August 24, 1976 (Exhibit N), P53,640.00 on October 13, 1976 (Exhibit O),
P406,430.00 on September 8, 1976 (Exhibit P), P199,508.00 on September 24, 1976
(Exhibit Q), P52,738.00 on October 22, 1976 (Exhibit R), and P264,436.00 on
October 7, 1976 (Exhibit S) were not entered in the books of Luzon Brokerage Corporation,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is completely without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>xxx" (pp. 85-87, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is evident from the
foregoing that the attachment was maliciously sued out and that as already
pointed out Schulze was not in bad faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">While as a general rule,
the liability on the attachment bond is limited to actual damages, moral and
exemplary damages may be recovered where the attachment was alleged to be
maliciously sued out and established to be so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Laza­tin</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Twano</span>
et al, L-12736 July 31, 1961)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In the instant case, the
issues of wrongful and malicious suing out of the writ of preliminary
attachment were joined not only in private respondents' motion to discharge the
attachment but also in their answer to the amended complaint (p. 38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court observed that the books and records of Luzon Brokerage Corporation dis­close
that the liabilities of the said corporation in the total amount of
P4,574,498.32 appear under the heading “Customs Deposit” (Exhibit 1-A) and this
amount includes </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the deposit of
Philippine Refining Co., Inc. in the sum of P1,475,840.00 (p. 26, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, plain­tiff never appeared in court, and failed to produce any evidence to
substantiate his charges (p. 26, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Well settled is the rule that the factual findings of the trial
court are entitled to great weight and respect on appeal, especially when
established by <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> testi­monial and
documentary evidence, as in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Anent the petition of the
surety, We say the fol­lowing:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically, petitioner surety contends that the dissolution of
the attachment extinguishes its obligation under the bond, for the basis of its
liability, which is wrongful attachment, no longer exists, the attachment bond
having been rendered void and ineffective, by virtue of Section 12,Rule 57 of the
Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 5, Petition)</p>

<p class="BODY">While Section 12, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court pro­vides that
upon the filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>, the attachment is
discharged or dissolved, nowhere is it provided that the attachment bond is
rendered void and ineffective upon the filing of <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The liability of the
attachment bond is defined in Section 4, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court, as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Condition of
applicant's bond. - The party applying for the order must give a bond executed
to the adverse party in an amount to be fixed by the judge, not exceeding the
applicant's claim, conditioned that the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">will pay all the costs which may be adjudged </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to the adverse party and all damages which he
may sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge
that the appli­cant was not entitled thereto."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the above provision that the respon­sibility of
the surety arises "if the court shall finally adjudge that the plaintiff
was not entitled thereto.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Rocco <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">vs. </span>Meads, 96 Phil Reports 884, we
held that the liability attaches if the plaintiff is not entitled to the
attachment because the requirements entitling him to the writ are wanting, or
if the plaintiff has no right to the attachment because the facts stated in his
affida­vit, or some of them, are untrue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is, therefore, evi­dent that upon the dismissal of an attachment
wrongfully issued, the surety is liable for damages <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as a </span>direct result of said attachment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally untenable is the Surety's contention that by filing a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>, private respondents waived any defect or flaw
in the issuance of the attachment writ, for they could have sought, without
need of filing any <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>, the discharge of the
attachment if the same was improperly or irregularly issued, as provided in Sec­tion
13, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether the attachment was discharged by either of the two (2)
ways indicated in the law, i.e., by filing <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span><span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> or by showing that the
order of attachment was improperly or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">irregularly
issued, the liability of the surety on the attachment bond subsists because the
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">final </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">reckoning </span>is when "the Court
shall finally adjudge <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that the
attaching creditor was not entitled" to the is­suance of the attachment
writ in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attachment
debtor cannot be deemed to have waived any defect in the issuance of the
attachment writ by simply availing himself of one way of discharging the
attachment writ, instead of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> is a
speedier way of discharging the attachment writ maliciously sought out by the
attaching creditor instead of the other way, which, in most instances like in
the present case, would require presentation of evidence in a <span class="SpellE">fullblown</span> trial on the merits and cannot easily be settled
in a pending incident of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We believe, however, that in the light of the factual situation
in this case, the damages awarded by the Inter­mediate Appellate Court are
rather excessive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They must be reduced.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment of said Appellate Court is hereby <u>modified</u>
as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both petitioner Calderon and
petitioner First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc. are hereby
