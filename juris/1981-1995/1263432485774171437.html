				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Brought to focus in this petition are the following issues:  (a) whether the jurisdictional facts that
need to be stated in a petition for letters of administration under Section
2(a), Rule 79 of the Rules of Court include the specific assertion that the
petitioner therein is an "interested person", and (b) whether the
administration court may properly and validly dismiss a petition for letters of
administration filed by one who is not an "interested person" after
having appointed an heir of the decedent as administrator of the latter's
intestate estate and set for pre-trial a claim against the said estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ricardo M. Gonzalez, District Manager of Shell Philippines, Inc.
for Mindanao (hereinafter referred to as Shell), filed on 8 January 1973 a
petition entitled "In the Matter of the Intestate Estate of the Deceased
Regino Canonoy, Petition for Letters of Administration, Ricardo M. Gonzalez,
Petitioner" with the then Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial
Court) of Agusan del Norte and Butuan City, praying therein that he be
appointed judicial administrator of the estate of the deceased Regino
Canonoy.  The case was docketed as SP
PROC. No. 343 and was raffled to Branch II of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 January 1973, Judge Vicente B. Echavez, Jr. of Branch II
issued an Order (1) setting the hearing on the petition for 23 March 1973 at
8:30 a.m.; (2) directing that the order be published, at petitioner's expense,
once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in a newspaper with a nationwide
circulation published regularly by a government agency or entity, or in any
newspaper published and edited in any part of the country which is in operation
during the existence of the present national emergency and of general
circulation in the province of Agusan del Norte and in Butuan City, if any
there be; and (3) ordering that copies of the order be sent by registered mail
or personal delivery, at the petitioner's expense, to each of all the known
heirs of the deceased Regino Canonoy, within the periods prescribed by Section
4, Rule 76 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In their Opposition to the issuance of letters of administration
to Gonzalez filed on 21 March 1973,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
private respondents, who are heirs of Regino Canonoy, allege that:  Gonzalez "is a complete stranger to the
intestate estate" of Regino Canonoy; he is "not even a creditor"
of the estate; he is a resident of Davao City and thus if appointed as administrator
of the estate, the bulk of which is located in Butuan City, "he would not
be able to perform his duties efficiently;" and he is an employee of Shell
Philippines, Inc., an alleged creditor of the estate, and so "he would not
be able to properly and effectively protect the interest of the estate in case
of conflicts." They, however, "propose" and pray that since
Bonifacio Canonoy, one of Regino's sons, enjoys preference in appointment
pursuant to Section 6, Rule 78 of the Rules of Court, he should "be
appointed administrator of the said intestate estate and the corresponding
letters of administration be issued in his favor."</p>

<p class="BODY">On 25 July 1973, after due hearing, the trial court appointed
Bonifacio Canonoy as administrator of the intestate estate of Regino Canonoy,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
having found him competent to act as such.  None of the parties moved to reconsider this Order or appealed
therefrom.  On 23 November 1973, herein
petitioner Shell, then known as Shell Philippines, Inc., filed its claim
against the estate of the deceased Regino Canonoy.  The duly appointed administrator, Bonifacio Canonoy, filed on 9
October 1974 a Motion to Dismiss the claim of Shell<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which the latter contested by filing an Opposition.  Shell likewise filed an amended claim against the estate.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
On 12 May 1975, the administrator filed his Reply to the Opposition to Motion
to Dismiss.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On 20 May 1975, he filed an Answer to the amended claim filed by Shell.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In the said Answer, he interposes compulsory counterclaims for the estate in
the amount of P659,423.49 representing rentals for land occupied by the Shell
Service Station, lighting allowances, allowances for salaries and wages of
service attendants, sales commission due the deceased Regino Canonoy and
reasonable attorney's fees.  Petitioner
filed an Answer to the Counterclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon joinder of the issues on Shell's claim, the trial court,
this time presided over by respondent Judge Fidel P. Dumlao, set the pre-trial
for 15 August 1975.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This was later re-set to 23 September 1975.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 18 August 1975, petitioner filed a motion to require the
judicial administrator to file an inventory of the properties of the deceased.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the pre-trial held on 23 September 1975, counsel for the
administrator requested for time to file a Motion to Dismiss the case.  In an Order issued on that date, the court
granted him ten (10) days to file the motion; opposing counsel was likewise
given ten (10) days from receipt of the same to file whatever pleading he may
deem proper to file, after which the motion shall be deemed submitted for
resolution.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The motion was filed on 30 September 1975.  It alleges that the court did not acquire jurisdiction over the subject
matter and nature thereof because the petitioner therein, Mr. Gonzalez, is not
the "interested person" contemplated by Section 2, Rule 79 of the
Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Shell filed its Opposition to the Motion on 16 October 1975<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
on the ground that the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case to
issue letters of administration as the interest of Gonzalez in the estate is
not a jurisdictional fact that needs to be alleged in the petition.  If at all, Gonzalez’ lack of interest in the
estate of the deceased only affected his competence to be appointed
administrator.  In an Order dated 8
November 1975, respondent Judge, finding the motion to be well-taken and
meritorious, dismissed the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The motion for its reconsideration having been denied by the trial court on 23
January 1976,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Shell filed the instant petition which it denominated as a petition for review
on <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Resolution dated 6 December 1976, this Court required the
respondents to comment on the petition;<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
the latter complied with the same on 31 January 1977.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, on 7 February 1977, this Court resolved, <i>inter alia</i>, to
treat the petition for review as a special civil action under Rule 65 of the
Rules of Court and require the parties to submit their respective Memoranda;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner filed its Memorandum on 4 April 1977<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
while the respondents filed theirs on 3 June 1977.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit; it must perforce be
granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the peculiar circumstances of the case, the trial court
clearly acted with grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed SP PROC. No. 343
after having set for pre-trial petitioner's amended claim against the
estate.  That said dismissal was
predicated solely on the ground that petitioner therein, Ricardo Gonzalez, is
not an "interested person," and that, since such interest is a
jurisdictional requirement, the trial court acquired no jurisdiction over the
case, serves only to compound the error.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2, Rule 79 of
the Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2. <i>  Contents
of petition for letters of administration</i>.  - A petition for letters of administration must be filed by an
interested person and must show, so far as known to the petitioner:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
jurisdictional facts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
names, ages, and residences of the heirs, and the names and residences of the
creditors, of the decedent;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
probable value and character of the property of the estate;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
name of the person for whom letters of administration are prayed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But no defect in the petition shall render void the issuance of
letters of administration."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The jurisdictional facts alluded to are:  the death of the testator, his residence at
the time of his death in the province where the probate court is sitting or, if
he is an inhabitant of a foreign country, his having left his estate in such
province.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
These facts are amply enumerated in the petition filed by Gonzalez.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact of death of the intestate and of his residence within the country are
foundation facts upon which all the subsequent proceedings in the
administration of the estate rest, and that if the intestate was not an
inhabitant of the state at the time of his death, and left no assets in the
state, and none came into it afterwards, no jurisdiction is conferred on the
court to grant letters of administration in any county.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly, the allegation that a petitioner seeking letters of administration is
an interested person, does not fall within the enumeration of jurisdictional
facts.  Of course, since the opening
sentence of the section requires that the petition must be filed by an
interested person, it goes without saying that a motion, to dismiss may lie not
on the basis of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the court, but rather on
the ground of lack of legal capacity to institute the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is precisely what happened in <u>Saguinsin</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Lindayag</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
where the dismissal of a petition for letters of administration was affirmed
because the petitioner "is not an heir of her deceased sister and,
therefore, has no material and direct interest in her estate."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
In the said case, this Court defined an interested party as one who would be
benefited by the estate, such as an heir, or one who has a claim against the
estate, such as a creditor; this interest must be material and direct, not
merely indirect or contingent.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>Saguinsin</u> doctrine is not, however, without
exception.  An objection to a petition for
letters of administration on that ground may be barred by waiver or estoppel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents herein did not file a motion to dismiss the
petition filed by Gonzalez on the ground of lack of capacity to sue;<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
they instead filed an Opposition which, unfortunately, did not ask for the
dismissal of the petition but merely opposed the issuance of letters of
administration in favor of Gonzalez because, among other reasons, he is a
stranger to the estate.  The Opposition
also proposed that Bonifacio Canonoy, one of the children of the deceased
Regino Canonoy, be appointed administrator of the latter's intestate
estate.  The failure to move for a
dismissal amounted to a waiver of the above-mentioned ground.  Section 8, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"A motion attacking a pleading or a proceeding shall include
all objections then available, and all objections not so included shall be
deemed waived."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, if a motion to dismiss is not filed, as what obtains in
this case, any of the grounds available for such a motion, except for improper
venue, may be pleaded as an affirmative defense, and a preliminary hearing
thereon may be had as if a motion to dismiss had been filed.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Excepted from the above rules are the following grounds:  (a) failure to state a cause of action which
may be alleged in a later pleading if one is permitted, or by a motion for
judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits, and (b) lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
subject to the exception as hereinafter discussed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Insurance</u> <u>Company</u> <u>of</u> <u>North</u> <u>America</u>
<u>vs.</u> <u>C.F.</u> <u>Sharp</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>Co.,</u> <u>Inc.</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Finally, appellant would contend that plaintiff has no
capacity to sue and is not the real party in interest.  It is now too late to raise these objections
here.  These should have been asserted
in the motion to dismiss filed by defendant below.  Not having been included therein, they are now barred by the rule
on omnibus motion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By proposing that Bonifacio Canonoy be appointed as administrator
instead of Mr. Gonzalez, private respondents have in fact approved or ratified
the filing of the petition by the latter.</p>

We held that:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The evidence submitted in the hearing does not satisfactorily
prove that the petitioner was legally adopted; hence, he did not have any
interest in the properties of the deceased Rosalia Saquitan.  Under ordinary circumstances, such defect
would authorize the dismissal of the proceedings especially in view of the fact
that the surviving spouse of Rosalia Saquitan had filed an affidavit of
adjudication under the provisions of Section 1 of Rule 74 of the Rules.  Counsel for Domingo Valmores, however, had
not objected to the application for the appointment of an administrator; he
only objected to the appointment of the said stranger Eulogio Eusebio as
administrator, claiming to have the right as surviving spouse to be appointed
as such administrator.  By this act of
Domingo Valmores, surviving spouse of the deceased, therefore, the fatal defect
in the petition may be considered, as cured.  In other words, the filing of the petition for the appointment of an
administrator may be considered as having been ratified by the surviving
husband, Domingo Valmores, and for this reason the proceedings may not be
dismissed."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. There can be no dispute that the trial court had acquired
jurisdiction over SP PROC. No. 343.  Immediately after the filing of the case, the trial court complied with
Section 3, Rule 79 of the Rules of Court by issuing the Order dated 27 January
1973.  At the initial hearing on 25 July
1973, petitioner Gonzalez established the jurisdictional requirements by
submitting in evidence proof of publication and service of notices of the
petition.  Thereafter, it heard the
evidence on the qualifications and competence of Bonifacio Canonoy, then
appointed him as administrator and finally directed that letters of
administration be issued to him, and that he take his oath of office after
putting up a surety or property bond in the amount of P5,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be presumed that Bonifacio Canonoy immediately qualified
as administrator because in that capacity, he filed a motion to dismiss
petitioner's claim against the estate,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
a Reply to the Opposition to the motion to dismiss<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
and an Answer to petitioner's amended claim against the estate wherein he
interposed a counterclaim,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
praying thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed of this Honorable
Court to dismiss the above-mentioned ‘Amended Claim Against the Estate’ and to
order the claimant to pay unto the intestate estate of Regino Canonoy the said
sum of P659,423.49, together with the interest thereon at the legal rate
beginning from the date hereof, the reasonable attorney's fees for the
prosecution of this counterclaim, and costs;</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>OR,</u> <u>IN</u> <u>THE</u> <u>ALTERNATIVE</u>, in the event
that any sum is found due from and payable by the said intestate estate of
Regino Canonoy in favor of the said claimant, the said amount be deducted from
the above-mentioned sum and, thereafter, to order the claimant to pay the
balance remaining unto the said intestate estate of Regino Canonoy, together
with interest thereon at the legal rate beginning from date hereof, the
reasonable attorney's fees for the prosecution of this counterclaim, and costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, therefore, not only had the administrator and the rest
of the private respondents voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the
trial court, they even expressly affirmed and invoked such jurisdiction in
praying for reliefs and remedies in their favor, namely:  (a) denial of Gonzalez’ prayer to be
appointed as administrator, (b) appointment of Bonifacio Canonoy as
administrator, (c) denial of petitioner Shell's amended claim against the
estate, and (d) the granting of the counterclaim.  Hence, they cannot now be heard to question the jurisdiction of
the trial court.  While it may be true
that jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, a party who
has affirmed and invoked it in a particular matter to secure an affirmative
relief cannot be allowed to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape
penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Tijam,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al.</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Sibonghanoy,</u>

this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"It has been held that a party can not invoke the jurisdiction
of a court to secure affirmative relief against his opponent and, after
obtaining or failing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question that same
jurisdiction (Dean vs. Dean, 136 Or. 694, 86 A.L.R. 79).  In the case just cited, by way of explaining
the rule, it was further said that the question whether (sic) the court had
jurisdiction either of the subject-matter of the action or of the parties was
not important in such cases because the party is barred from such conduct <i>not
because the judgment or order of the court is valid and conclusive as an
adjudication, but for the reason that such a practice can not be tolerated</i>
-- obviously for reasons of public policy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, it has also been held that after voluntarily
submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it is
too late for the loser to question the jurisdiction or power of the court
(Pease vs. Rathbun-Jones etc., 243 U.S. 273, 61 L.Ed. 715, 37 S.Ct. 283; St.
Louis etc. vs. McBride, 141 U.S. 127, 35 L.Ed. 659).  And in Littleton vs. Burgess, 16 Wyo. 58, the Court said that it
is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the jurisdiction of a
court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative relief, to afterwards
deny that same jurisdiction to escape a penalty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge should have lent his ears to <u>Tijam</u> <u>vs.</u>
<u>Sibonghanoy</u> instead of peremptorily granting the motion to dismiss in an
Order which does not even care to expound on why the court found the said
motion to be meritorious.  He exhibited
undue haste in removing the case from his docket and in abdicating judicial
authority and responsibility.  Howsoever
viewed, he committed grave abuse of discretion.</p>
