<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">At once apparent is that
the whole controversy has resulted from the laconic character of the Trial
Court's disposition that "<b>Defendant </b></span><span class="SpellE"><b>Monoloto</b></span><b>
is entitled to the possession of the vehicle in question</b>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Stated
otherwise, the issue stems from that Court's failure to go beyond simply
declaring <span class="SpellE">Manloto</span> to be entitled to the possession of
the vehicle in question, by </span><b>also and categorically requiring the
delivery thereof to <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>, and furthermore
anticipating and providing for the contingency of Filipinas' inability to give
possession of the car to <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span></b>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is Filipinas' contention that "the orders appealed from
are void for being at variance with, and in excess of, the terms of the
decision which they purport to execute." It argues that -</p>

<blockquote>"While It is true that the decision held that 'Defendant <span class="SpellE">Maneloto</span> is entitled to the possession of the vehicle in
question' there was, however, no specific and definite order in the decision
directing plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> (a) to return the
possession of the said motor vehicle to defendant <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>,
(b) or in the alternative, to pay to defendant <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>,
jointly and severally with the bonding company, the amount of P7,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither was there a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">finding </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the Court as to the value of the property,
much less a finding of P7,000.00."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">1</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">And since, according to Filipinas, the
judgment had become <span class="SpellE">executory</span> it can no longer be
modified or varied in any way; execution can only be had strictly in accordance
with its terms.</p>

<p class="BODY">Filipinas also claims that the Trial Court committed serious
error in decreeing that in case it (Filipinas) could not "deliver
possession of the car to Defendant <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> within
ten (10) days," it is "liable on its bond in the sum of
P7,000.00", it being argued that that disposition was <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of Section 10, Rule 60, in relation to Section 20, Rule 57 of the Rules of
Court, requiring that recovery upon a bond for any damages resulting from a
writ of seizure (in a <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">replevin</i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>suit) may be had only upon
application with notice to the surety or sureties, and after proper hearing, to
be included in the final judgment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a>
Furthermore, it adds, <span class="SpellE">Manaloto's</span> "bare
allegation that the amount of P7,000.00 was 'the value of the property' **
hardly suffices as evidentiary basis for a finding of 'the value of the
property'", which value should properly have been established by proof
"adduced during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, not
after it had been terminated by final judgment".<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The theory that because the Trial Court's judgment merely <b>"ordered"
"that defendant <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> is entitled to the
possession of the vehicle in question"</b> -- <i>without</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> also commanding </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">that it be delivered to <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span></span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> -- </span>the Court is powerless to issue a
writ of execution requiring such delivery, is absurd.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The theory ignores the plain meaning and
import of the language of the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The declaration that <span class="SpellE"><b>Manaloto</b></span><b> is
entitled to the possession of the car</b>, is in effect a declaration that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">no other party is entitled to its
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></i>It is thus a declaration
that Filipinas, which was then in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Filipinas,
which was then in possession of the vehicle, had no right to continue In
possession thereof, and was bound to recognize <span class="SpellE">Manaloto’s</span>
superior right to possession under the judgment in the case in which both were
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Court's opinion
makes clear that Filipinas "was not entitled to any protection save a judgment
in its favor for the recovery of a sum of money from <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span>
Garcia." The inescapable conclusion from these premises is that Filipinas
--- not being entitled to the possession of the car because <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>
has been adjudged entitled thereto; having no other right except to recover a
sum of money from Garcia; and being bound to recognize the Court's adjudication
to this effect --- should deliver the automobile to <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To argue otherwise would be to argue against
simple logic and plain language. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">we </span>have more than once ruled, a
judgment is not confined to what appears on the face of the decision but
comprehends what is necessarily included therein or necessary thereto to make
it effective;</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> and that while, for purposes of execution,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision controls, when
there is ambiguity or uncertainty therein, the body of the opinion may be
referred to for purposes of construing the <span class="SpellE">jugment</span>
because the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of a decision must find

other words, the sufficiency of the writing claimed to be a judgment should
always be tested by its substance rather than the form."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">What Filipinas did
however was unjustifiable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowing fully
well that it was not entitled to the possession of the car and that <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> was the party judicially declared to be entitled
thereto; and being aware that "it is not entitled to any protection save a
judgment in its favor for the recovery of a sum of money from <span class="SpellE">Remegio</span> Garcia", it not only chose to retain possession
of the car but assumed rights of ownership over said car by selling it to a
third person and appropriating the proceeds of the sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this way Filipinas not only completely set
the Court's <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment at naught as regards
the possession of the car, but also retained the right to execute that part of
the judgment decreeing payment to it by <span class="SpellE">Remegio</span>
Garcia of the sum of P7,360.00, plus interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">A </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">clearer case of double compensation, or
unjust enrichment can hardly be </span>conceived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is worse is that Filipinas would now
justify these acts by capitalizing on the undeniable albeit inconsequential
imprecision in the Trial Court's judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having made it impossible for it to accord respect to <span class="SpellE">Manaloto's</span> adjudicated right to the car In question, and to
deliver it to him, Filipinas would also absolve itself from compensating <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> for the loss of the vehicle by the plea that this
had not been decreed in the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
would, in other words, absolve itself from liability for paying for the value
of car which it had sold to another instead of delivering it to <span class="SpellE">Monaloto</span>, as it was bound to do under the judgment, by
simply pleading that it could no longer make delivery, and unfortunately for <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>, this had not been foreseen, and provided for, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would make its very act of disobedience
and defiance to the judgment the excuse for not making amends <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, too,
is unjustifiable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, Filipinas would evade liability by the claim that the
Court had never made "a finding as to the value of the property, much less
a finding of P7,000.00." It evidently has lost sight of its own averments
that it had accepted a chattel mortgage over the car <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">as </span>security for an obligation in the sum of P7,366.00, and had
filed a <span class="SpellE"><i>replevin</i></span> bond in double the value of
the car.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> It is bound by these averments<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The
averments are conclusive upon it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot now say <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">that </span>there is no
factual foundation for the requirement that it pay to <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span>
the sum of P7,000.00 as recompense for the car which it had illegally sold to a
third person, instead of delivering it to <span class="SpellE">Manaloto</span> as
was its declared <span class="SpellE">prestation</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">As untenable as its
preceding arguments is Filipinas' contention that the ad judgment that it is
liable on its bond in the sum of P7,000.00 is <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of Section 10, Rule 60, in relation to Section 20, Rule 57 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But slight reflection should show
that the provisions cited refer to a situation where the sureties upon a <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">replevin</i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>bond are sought to be made liable
upon their undertaking to respond for any damages resulting from a writ of
