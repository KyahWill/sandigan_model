<p class="BODY">In his lifetime, Joaquin Tiu Singco, father of petition­er Tiu
Peck, owned and operated the Argentina Trading, a business engaged in the
buying and selling of lumber hardware and general merchandise in San Marcelino,
Zambales.  Helping him run the business were
private respondents:  Tan  King who helped manage the store and
receiving P200.00 a month, while his wife Conchita M. Rubiato did the marketing
and cooking for which work she received a salary of a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">r</span>ound P180.00 to P240.00 a month.  The business license wa<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">s</span>
however, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>the name of Conchita
M. Rubiato.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the death of Joaquin Tiu Singco in 1974, Tiu Peck took over
and continued the business left by his father Tan King and Conchita M. Rubiato
continued to help him in the management of the said business eventually
becoming <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">partners thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1983, petitioners and private respondents decided to
end their business partnership.  Accordingly, they sought the help of five (5) respected members of the
Filipino Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Olongapo City (of which
petitioners and private respondents are members) to act as middlemen.  Together with the five (5) middlemen, Tiu
Peck and Tan King discussed the manner of their separation and the liquidation
of the partnership <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">properties.  As a result of the discussion, an
"Agreement </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
" courier="" new""="">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">the

Tan King, also known as Tiu To Suan, both signed the Agreement to which the
five (5) middlemen also affixed their signatures as witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing recital of errors may be reduced to two (2)
principal issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue concerns the alleged business partnership between
Tiu Peck on the one hand and the spouses Tan <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class="BODY">We agree with the resolution of the respondent court on this
issue.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"To begin with, it cannot be said that there was a business

<p class="BODY">Following the abovequoted ratiocination of respondent court, we
expected it to then rule on the validity and binding effect of the partition of
the subject properties between the two (2) contending parties as
co-owners.  Unfortunately, it diverted
from the trend of its position when it disregarded the real intention of the
parties which was to divide the businesses and properties owned by them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:

mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that private respondent Conchita M. Rubiato
initiated the move to terminate the so-called partnership when she informed Tiu
Peck that since their children were already grown-up, it was a propitious time
for them to separate their businesses.  To this proposal, Tiu <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">Peck
agreed.  With the help of five (5)
respected middlemen, they drew up on 31 August 1983 the Agreement on the
Apportionment of Partnership Businesses which they all signed.  There can be no doubt, therefore, that the
two (2) parties wanted to go their separate ways in their business and to get
their respective shares of the properties which they owned in common when they
drew up and executed the 31 August 1983 agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to the second issue:  whether or not the agreement of 31 August 1983 is valid and
binding between the petitioners and private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that petitioners and the private respondents
voluntarily entered into the agreement to apportion or divide their businesses,
whether as partners or <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">co-owners.  That agreement is the law between them.  Contracts shall be obligatory in whatever
form they may have been entered into, provided all the essential requisites for
their validity are present.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""=""><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""=""> The fact that after signing the
agreement both parties immediately took possession of their respective shares
is the most compelling evidence that there was indeed a binding partition of
the properties.  Contracts, once
perfected, have the force of law between the parties who are bound to comply
therewith in good faith, and neither one may, without the consent of the other,
renege therefrom.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""=""><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And, as held by respondent court, even though petitioner Lee Yok
Yan and respondent Conchita M. Rubiato were not actual signatories to the
agreement, nonetheless, such agreement is persuasive for or against them.  Indeed, private respondents have no
justification to refuse delivery <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">of
TCT No. T-24999 to petitioners after they agreed to the partition and
consequently took possession of the piggery business and operated it for three
(3) years before changing their minds and seeking a new partition.  It has </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

" courier="" new""="">been explained by them – as perhaps explanation is not possible
– why it took them three (3) years before they decided for another partition of
the same properties subject of their </span>agreement on 31 August 1983.</p>
