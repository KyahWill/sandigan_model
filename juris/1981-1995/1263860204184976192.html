<p class="BODY">In 1984, petitioner undertook the tracking down of pilferages of
electricity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among those investigated
were its own employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fourteen (14)
employees, including private respondents herein, were found to have tampered
meters and illegal connections in their houses resulting in the pilferage of
electricity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of said fourteen (14)
employees, nine (9) agreed to resign and thereafter claimed the benefits, due
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The five (5) private respondents
did not, and were subsequently dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, private respondents filed separate cases for illegal
dismissal and non-payment or underpayment benefits against petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of private respondents' dismissal, petitioner
presented the following evidence:</p>

<blockquote><b><u>MAYNARDO</u> <u>TANADA</u><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Of the service wires (neutral and live), only the neutral wire
could be pulled out from the built-in pipe in concrete, hence it is suspected
there is an illegal tapping to the wire inside the conduit pipe installed in
time of concreting leading to load side without passing through the meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Memorandum from Meter Calibration/
Replacement Crew, Annexes 5 &amp; 5-A, Position Paper of the Petitioner).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is confirmed by the great disparity
between estimated monthly KWH consumption of 127.8 per load survey and the
actual registered consumption ranging from 32 to 45 KWH per month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Annexes 6 &amp; 7, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>)</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><u>RENATO</u> <u>BACUBE</u><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>There was a trace that his house was <span class="SpellE">jumpered</span>
because duplex wire was peeled off and a splice was left.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Annexes 5 &amp; 5-A, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also found using a different meter
from the one issued for this house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Memorandum from Chief Technical Services Section, Annex 10, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The estimated monthly KWH consumption was 52
KW, while the registered consumption is 25 KWH per month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Annexes 8 &amp; 9, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><u>FLAVIANO</u> <u>AGUBANG</u><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appliances that require large amount of electricity were directly
tapped to the service drop.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
consumption does not register in the meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Annex 10. <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">PETRONIO</span></u></b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> <u>R.</u> <u>POBEDA</u><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>His KWH meter was positioned upside down in such a way that the
meter disc could hardly move, causing minimal registration of electricity
consumed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Annex 1-C, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">RAMON</span></u></b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> <u>A</u>. <u>PAREJA</u><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Service drop was peeled off (Annex 1-D, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>)
where it could be reached easily by hand from a hole in the wall of his house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 12-13; 63-64.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter, while finding that there was basis to suspect
private respondents of pilferage, nevertheless found that private respondents
had been illegally dismissed and ordered their reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, as the evidence proved insufficient to warrant
their dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claims for unpaid
or underpaid benefits were dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, public respondent National Labor Relations Commission
dismissed petitioner's appeal and affirmed the decision of the Labor
Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's motion for
reconsideration was subsequently denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its petition, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Electric
Cooperative assails the finding of the Labor Arbiter, affirmed by the NLRC,
that the evidence against private respondents was insufficient to warrant their
dismissal, end thus ascribes to the NLRC grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack or excess of jurisdiction for sustaining the Labor Arbiter's decision to
order their reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment, the Solicitor General expressed his agreement
with the petitioner and recommended "that the petition be given due course
and that the decision of the Labor Arbiter as affirmed by respondent NLRC be
reversed and set aside and the dismissal of private respondents be
ordered." [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 70.] He was of the view
that there was sufficient basis to justify private respondents' dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties filed their respective memoranda and, in view of the
Solicitor General's position, the NLRC was required to designate another lawyer
to file its memorandum [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 101.] After the
NLRC complied and filed its memorandum, the case was deemed submitted for
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the facts as found by the Labor Arbiter and
adopted by the NLRC, the arguments of the parties, the law and the
jurisprudence on the matter, the Court finds that petitioner has failed to show
that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion, amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction, when it affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both petitioner and the Solicitor General argue that private
respondents may be legally dismissed on the ground of loss of confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support thereof, they cite the leading cases
of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Galsim</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><u>v</u>. <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Philippine</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>National</u>
<u>Bank</u> G.R. </span>No. L-23921, <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="8">August
 29, 1969</st1:date>, 29 SCRA 293] and <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Reyes</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><u>v</u>. <st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Zamora</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> G.R. </span>No. L-46732, <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1979</st1:date>, 90 SCRA 92].</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Reyes</u>, <u>supra,</u> the Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>Loss of confidence is a valid ground for dismissing an employee, and
proof beyond reasonable doubt of the employee's misconduct - apparently
demanded by the Minister of Labor - is not required to dismiss him on this
charge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient if there is
"some basis" for such loss of confidence; or if the employer has reasonable
grounds to believe, if not to entertain the moral conviction that the employee
concerned is responsible for the misconduct and that the nature of his
participation therein rendered him absolutely unworthy of the trust and
confidence demanded by his position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[at
p.111.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds petitioner's and the Solicitor General's reliance
on the above-quoted rule misplaced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
facts of the instant case negate the application of the doctrine cited.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic premise for dismissal on the ground of loss of
confidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>that the employee
concerned holds a position of trust and confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the breach of this trust that results
in the employer's loss of confidence in the employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Galsim</u></span>,
<u>supra</u>, the employee dismissed was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
</span>paying teller, while in <u>Reyes</u>, <u>supra</u>, the employee was the
company's credit and collection manager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In both cases, the loss or misappropriation of money under their custody
or control was involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Nevans</u></span> <u>v</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Industrial</u>
<u>Relations</u> G.R. No. L-21510, June 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 1321], another case
cited by the Solicitor General, the employee dismissed on the ground of loss of
confidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>the head checker
of the company and the loss involved merchandise under his management and
supervision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Labor Code, as amended, loss of confidence would be the
result of "fraud or willful breach by the employee of the trust reposed on
him by his employer or duly authorized representative," a just cause for
termination under Article 282.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot
be gainsaid that the breach of trust must be related to the performance of the
employee's functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, private respondents held no position
involving trust and confidence, with the possible exception of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span> who was a bill collector.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But even then, <span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>
was not being charged with the loss of money he had collected.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">*</span></span></a> Respondents were actually being accused by
petitioner with the pilferage of electricity as <u>consumers</u> of the
electric power it provided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
clear from the report of petitioner's investigators who found the pilferage to
have been effected <u>through</u> <u>the</u> <u>electric</u> <u>wires</u> <u>leading</u>
<u>to</u> <u>private respondents'</u> <u>residences</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span><u>the</u> <u>meters</u> <u>attached</u> <u>thereto</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Essentially, private respondents were
dismissed for their non-payment of the electricity they allegedly consumed or,
more graphically, for cheating on their electric bill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the pilferage could have been effected <u>even</u>
<u>if</u> <u>private</u> <u>respondents</u> <u>were</u> <u>not</u> <u>employees</u>
<u>of</u> <u>petitioner</u> but were ordinary consumers is undisputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, while the pilferage could have been
facilitated by their employment with petitioner, in that the knowledge
necessary to effect the alleged meter tampering and illegal connections could
have been acquired in their employment, such did not necessarily make the alleged
offense work-related.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner and the Solicitor General, however, point to a company
policy (Policy No. 35) which makes pilferage by employees punishable with
dismissal, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>Coop employee-consumers found knowingly using tampered meters at
his own residence, rented apartment or houses and using other devises in the
pilferage of electricity should be punished by dismissal from the service
[Comment, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 64.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">However, the Court finds that even under
this company policy, the dismissal of private respondents cannot be
sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by the Labor
Arbiter, whose decision was affirmed by the public respondent:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . [R]<span class="SpellE">espondent</span> (petitioner herein)
has still to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the complainants
(private respondents herein) were knowingly using the tampered meters or using
other devices to pilfer electricity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is the import of the company's policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <u>the</u> <u>case</u> <u>at</u> <u>bar</u>,
<u>there</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u> <u>evidence</u> <u>to</u> <u>show</u> <u>that</u>

<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> <u>pilfer</u> <u>electricity</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><u>There</u> <u>is</u> <u>no</u> <u>evidence</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>complainants</u>
<u>were</u> <u>the</u> <u>ones</u> <u>who</u> <u>installed</u>, <u>made</u> <u>or</u>
<u>caused</u> <u>the</u> <u>connection</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>devices</u> <u>used</u>
<u>in</u> <u>pilfering</u> <u>electricity</u>. . . .<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 29;
Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The insufficiency of the evidence relied upon by petitioner is
particularly apparent with regard to private respondents <span class="SpellE">Tanada</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bacube</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
found by the Labor Arbiter, the sole basis of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">petition</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">er</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> in </span>concluding that they have pilfered
electricity was the disparity between their estimated monthly consumption and
their actual consumption but petitioner had failed to show that the disparity
could have resulted only if they had pilfered electricity [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.
p. 28.] On the other hand, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Agubang</span>, there is even evidence to show that the alleged
illegal connection was done by a lessee of the lower floor of his house <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">("<span class="SpellE"><u>silong</u></span>")
</span>without his knowledge or consent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">[<u>Ibid</u>.,
</span>pp. 23-24.] Then, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span><span class="SpellE">Petronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobeda</span> caused the
installation of the defective meter in his residence is not conclusive, as he
had allegedly just recently transferred thereto <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">[Ibid</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">., </span>p.
25.] Finally, in Ramon <span class="SpellE">Pareja's</span> case, while it was
suspected that he used a "jumper" since the service drop connection
leading to his house was peeled off, no such illegal contraption <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>actually found <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">[<u>Ibid</u>. </span>p. 26.] In sum, the
evidence in support of petitioner's position that private respondents knowingly
used tampered meters or devices to effect the pilferage of electric power is
inconclusive.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a basic principle in the dismissal of employees that the
burden of proof rests upon the employer to show that the dismissal of the
employee is for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>just cause,
and failure to do so would necessarily mean that the dismissal is not justified
[<span class="SpellE">Polymedic</span> General Hospital v. NLRC, G.R. No. 64190,
January 31, 1985, 134 SCRA 420; Asphalt and Cement Pavers, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, et al., G.R. No. 74563, June 20, 1988.] Should
the employer fail in discharging this duty, the dismissal of the employee
cannot be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is consonant
with the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure, as implemented in what
is now Sec. 279 of the Labor Code, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, public respondent NLRC and the Labor Arbiter
have both found that petitioner had failed to prove a just cause for the
dismissal of private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
a careful consideration of the pleadings filed and the arguments raised by the
parties and the Solicitor General, the Court finds no cogent reason to disturb
this finding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Court had
emphasized in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Dangan</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span><u>v</u>. <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>It is perhaps timely to reiterate well-settled principles involving
decisions of administrative agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Findings of quasi-judicial agencies which have acquired expertise
because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters are generally
accorded not only respect but at times even finality if such findings are
supported by substantial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

this Court has held that the findings of facts of the National Labor Relations
Commission are binding on the Court (Philippine Labor Alliance Council [PLAC]
