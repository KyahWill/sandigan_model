<p class="BODY">Kimberly-Clark Philippines, Inc. (KIMBERLY, for brevity) executed
a three-year collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with United Kimberly-Clark
Employees Union-Philippine Transport and General Workers' Organization
(UKCEU-PTGWO) which expired on <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="6">June

<p class="BODY">Within the 60-day freedom period prior to the expiration of and
during the negotiations for the renewal of the aforementioned CBA, some members

Association in Line Industries and Agriculture (KILUSAN-OLALIA)."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1986</st1:date>,
KILUSAN-OLALIA filed a petition for certification election in Regional Office

KIMBERLY and UKCEU-PTGWO did not object to the holding of a certification
election but objected to the inclusion of the so-called contractual workers
whose employment with KIMBERLY was coursed through an independent contractor,
Rank Manpower Company (RANK, for short), as among the qualified voters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>resolution of<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the petition for certification election by

1982 and 1983; (4) non-payment of minimum wages; (5) coercion of employees; and
(6) engaging in CBA negotiations despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of a petition for certification election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was later amended to withdraw the charge of coercion but to add, as
new charges, the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> Jimenez and the
non-payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of the reinstated <span class="SpellE">Emerito</span> Fuentes.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Conciliation proceedings conducted by the bureau proved futile,

<p class="BODY">On May 26, 1986, KIMBERLY petitioned MOLE to assume jurisdiction

Minister <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> S. Sanchez issued an assumption

is directed to resume its operations immediately thereafter and to accept all
the employees back under the same terms and conditions of employment prevailing
prior to the industrial action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further,
all issues in the notice of strike, as amended, are hereby assumed in this
assumption order, except for the representation issue pending in Region IV in

<p class="BODY">During the pre-election conference, 64 casual workers were
challenged by KIMBERLY and UKCEU-PTGWO on the ground that they are not
employees of KIMBERLY but of RANK.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was agreed by all the parties that the 64 voters shall be allowed to cast their
votes but that their ballots shall be segregated and subject to challenge

Article 212(e) of the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On

agent, the testimonies of KIMBERLY'S witnesses, and pictures of the
barricade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>KILUSAN-OLALIA moved to
dissolve the TRO on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately after the expiration of the first TRO on June 9,
1987, the striking employees returned to their <span class="SpellE">picketlines</span>
and reestablished their barricades at the gate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On June 19, 1987, the commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> issued a second
TRO.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 25, 1987, KILUSAN-OLALIA filed another petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition with this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 78791, questioning the
validity of the temporary restraining orders issued by the NLRC on May 26, 1987
and June 19, 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On June 29, 1987,
KILUSAN-OLALIA filed in said case an urgent motion for a TRO to restrain NLRC
from implementing the questioned orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An opposition, as well as a reply thereto, were filed by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on July 3, 1987, KIMBERLY filed in the NLRC an urgent
motion for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction when the strikers
returned to the strike area after the second TRO expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing, the commission issued a
writ of preliminary injunction on July 14, 1987, after requiring KIMBERLY to
post a bond in the amount of P20,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, on July 17, 1987, KILUSAN-OLALIA filed in G.R. No.
78791 a second urgent motion for the issuance of a TRO by reason of the
issuance of said writ of preliminary injunction, which motion was opposed by
KIMBERLY.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, in its memorandum<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
filed on December 28, 1989 and in its motion for early resolution<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
filed on February 28, 1990, both in G.R. No. 78791, KILUSAN-OLALIA alleged that
it had terminated its strike and picketing activities and that the striking employees
had unconditionally offered to return to work, although they were refused
admission by KIMBERLY.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By reason of this
supervening development, the petition in G.R. No. 78791, questioning the
propriety of the issuance of the two temporary restraining orders and the writ
of injunction therein, has been rendered moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 77629, the petition of KILUSAN-OLALIA avers that the
respondent Secretary of labor and/or the former Minister of Labor have acted
with grave abuse of discretion and/or without jurisdiction in (1) ruling on the
issue of bargaining representation and declaring respondent UKCEU-PTGWO as the
collective bargaining representative of all regular rank-and-file employees of
the respondent company; (2) holding that petitioners are not entitled to vote
in the certification election; (3) considering the regularization of
petitioners (who are not janitors and maintenance employees) to be effective
only on the date of the disputed decision; (4) declaring petitioners who are
assigned janitorial and yard maintenance work to be employees of respondent
RANK and not entitled to be regularized; (5) not awarding to petitioners
differential pay arising out of such illegal work scheme; and (6) ordering the
mere reinstatement of petitioner Jimenez.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of jurisdiction actually involves a question of whether
or not former Minister Sanchez committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of jurisdiction in declaring respondent UKCEU-PTGWO as the certified
bargaining representative of the regular employees of KIMBERLY, after ruling
that the 64 casual workers, whose votes are being challenged, were not entitled
to vote in the certification election.</p>

<p class="BODY">KILUSAN-OLALIA contends that after finding that the 64 workers
are regular employees of KIMBERLY, Minister Sanchez should have remanded the
representation case to the med-arbiter, instead of declaring UKCEU-PTGWO as the
winner in the certification election and setting aside the med arbiter's order
which allowed the 64 casual workers to cast their votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents argue that since the issues of regularization and
representation are closely interrelated and that a resolution of the former
inevitably affects the latter, it was necessary for the former labor minister
to take cognizance of the representation issue; that no timely motion for
reconsideration or appeal was made from his decision of November 13, 1986 which
has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; and that the
aforesaid decision was impliedly accepted by KILUSAN-OLALIA when it demanded
from KIMBERLY the issuance of regular appointments to its affected members in
compliance with said decision, hence petitioner employees are now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning the legality thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">We uphold the authority of former Minister Sanchez to assume
jurisdiction over the issue of the regularization of the 64 casual workers,
which fact is not even disputed by KILUSAN-OLALIA as may be gleaned from its
request for an interim order in the notice of strike case (BLR-NS-5-164-86),
asking that the regularization issue be immediately resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, even the med-arbiter who ordered
the holding of the certification election refused to resolve the protest on the
ground that the issue raised therein correctly pertains to the jurisdiction of
the then labor minister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No opposition
was offered by KILUSAN-OLALIA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold
that the issue of regularization was properly addressed to the discretion of
said former minister.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the matter of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
pronouncement by former Minister Sanchez, as reaffirmed by respondent
secretary, regarding the winner in the certification election presents a
different situation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that in the certification election,
UKCEU-PTGWO came out as the winner, by garnering a majority of the votes cast
therein with the exception of 64 ballots which were subject to challenge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the protest filed for the opening and
counting of the challenged ballots, KILUSAN-OLALIA raised the main and sole
question of regularization of the 64 casual workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The med-arbiter refused to act on the protest
on the ground that the issue involved is within the jurisdiction of the then
Minister of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>KILUSAN-OLALIA then
sought an interim order for an early resolution on the employment status of the
casual workers, which was one of the issues included in the notice of strike
filed by KILUSAN-OLALIA in BLR Case No. NS-5-164-86.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Minister Sanchez rendered the
questioned decision finding that the workers not engaged in janitorial and yard
maintenance service are regular employees but that they became regular only on
the date of his decision, that is, on November 13, 1986, and, therefore, they
were not entitled to vote in the certification election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the results obtained in the
certification election, Minister Sanchez declared UKCEU-PTGWO as the winner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue, therefore, is when said workers, not
performing janitorial or yard maintenance service, became regular employees of
KIMBERLY.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find and so hold that the former labor minister gravely abused
his discretion in holding that those workers not engaged in janitorial or yard
maintenance<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>service attained the status
of regular employees only on November 13, 1986, which thus deprived them of
their constitutionally protected right to vote in the certification election
and choose their rightful bargaining representative.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Code defines who are regular employees, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 280.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Regular</u>
<u>and</u> <u>Casual</u> <u>Employment</u>. - The provisions of written
agreements to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral
agreements of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where
the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary
or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except where the
employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion
or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of
the employee or where the work or services to be performed is seasonal in
nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not
covered by the preceding paragraph:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>,
That any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether such
service is continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with
respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall
continue while such activity exists."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The law thus provides for two kinds of regular employees,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) those who are engaged to
perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual
business or trade of the employer; and (2) those who have rendered at least one
year of service, whether continuous or broken, with respect to the activity in
which they are employed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The individual
petitioners herein who have been adjudged to be regular employees fall under
the second category.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are the
mechanics, electricians, machinists, machine shop helpers, warehouse helpers,
painters, carpenters, <span class="SpellE">pipefitters</span> and masons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed that these workers have
been in the employ of KIMBERLY for more than one year at the time of the filing
of the petition for certification election by KILUSAN-OLALIA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Owing to their length of service with the company, these workers
became regular employees, by operation of law, one year after they were
employed by KIMBERLY through RANK.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
the actual regularization of these employees entails the mechanical act of
issuing regular appointment papers and compliance with such other operating
procedures as may be adopted by the employer, it is more in keeping with the
intent and spirit of the law to rule that the status of regular employment
attaches to the casual worker on the day immediately after the end of his first
year of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To rule otherwise, and
to instead make their regularization dependent on the happening of some
contingency or the fulfillment of certain requirements, is to impose a burden
on the employee which is not sanctioned by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the first stated position is the situation contemplated and sanctioned
by law is further enhanced by the absence of a statutory limitation before
regular status can be acquired by a casual employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law is explicit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As long as the employee has rendered at least
one year of service, he becomes a regular employee with respect to the activity
in which he is employed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law does
not provide the qualification that the employee must first be issued a regular
appointment or must first be formally declared as such before he can acquire a
regular status.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, where the law
does not distinguish, no distinction should be drawn.</p>

<p class="BODY">The submission that the decision of November 13, 1986 has become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, on the grounds that no timely
appeal has been made <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and that
KILUSAN-OLALIA has impliedly acceded thereto, is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 65 of the Rules of Court allows original petitions for <i>certiorari</i>
from decisions or orders of public respondents provided they are filed within a
reasonable time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We believe that the
period from January 9, 1987, when the motions for reconsideration separately
filed by KILUSAN-OLALIA and KIMBERLY were denied, to March 16, 1987, when the
petition in G.R. No. 77629 was filed, constitutes a reasonable time for
availing of such recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise do not subscribe to the claim of respondents that
KILUSAN-OLALIA has impliedly accepted the questioned decision by demanding
compliance therewith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the letter of
KILUSAN-OLALIA dated November 24, 1986,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
addressed to the legal counsel of KIMBERLY, it is there expressly and specifically
pointed out that KILUSAN-OLALIA intends to file a motion for reconsideration of
the questioned decision but that, in the meantime, it was demanding the
issuance of regular appointments to the casual workers who had been declared to
be regular employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The filing of said
motion for reconsideration of the questioned decision by KILUSAN-OLALIA, which
was later denied, sustains our position on this issue and denies the theory of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> postulated by respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing circumstances, and as a consequence
of their status as regular employees, those workers not performing janitorial
and yard maintenance service were perforce entitled to the payment of salary
differential, cost of living allowance, 13th month pay, and such other benefits
extended to regular employees under the CBA, from the day immediately following
their first year of service in the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These regular employees are likewise entitled to vote in the
certification election held on July 1, 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the votes cast by those employees not performing
janitorial and yard maintenance service, which form part of the 64 challenged
votes, should be opened, counted and considered for the purpose of determining
the certified bargaining representative.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not find it necessary to disturb the finding of then
Minister Sanchez holding as legal the service contract executed between
KIMBERLY and RANK, with respect to the workers performing janitorial and yard
maintenance service, which is supported by substantial and convincing
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, we take judicial
notice of the general practice adopted in several government and private
institutions and industries of hiring a janitorial service on an independent
contractor basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
occasional directives and suggestions of KIMBERLY are insufficient to erode
primary and continuous control over the employees of the independent
contractor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Lastly, the duties performed by these workers are not independent and integral
steps in or aspects of the essential operations of KIMBERLY which is engaged in
the manufacture of consumer paper products and cigarette paper, hence said
workers cannot be considered regular employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> Jimenez
without back-wages involves a question of fact best addressed to the discretion
of respondent secretary whose finding thereon is binding and conclusive upon
this Court, absent a showing that he committed a grave abuse in the exercise
thereof.</p>
