motorcycle to meet </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">friend that
tragic night.  Little did he know that
it was death that awaited him, to fall upon him with knives and leave him
lifeless on the road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Three men were originally
charged in the information for his murder.  One was shot to death before he could be arraigned.  Another has never been identified and is
still at large.  This appeal concerns
only Buenaventura Aruta, who claims he was erroneously convicted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The killing occurred on
December 26, 1982, at about seven o'clock in the evening, in Jaro, Leyte.  The prosecution presented two alleged
eyewitnesses who both pointed to Aruta as one of the assailants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Adriano Marmita testified that on the night in question, he was
waiting for Cesar Galvez at Sta. Cruz Street so he could hitch a ride on his
motorcycle.  When Galvez arrived,
Nathaniel Quiñones, who was standing about 8 meters <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">away, </span>called him.  Galvez
alighted from his motorcycle and parked it, after which Quiñones approached
him.  Quiñones then restrained Galvez by
the shoulders and shouted "Fight him!" This must have been a
pre-arranged signal for it was then that Buenaventura Aruta and another person
emerged from the edge of the road to attack Galvez.  Aruta stabbed Galvez twice in the chest.  The other person stabbed Galvez in the side
of his body.  Quiñones also stabbed the
now helpless Galvez in the abdomen.  Galvez was dead when he fell.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Marmita said that he fled in fear and thereafter rode with
Cresente Puertollano on his motorcycle to inform Jacinto Galvez of his son's
death.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Martin Rombo made practically the same narration of Galvez's
killing.  He said he was on his way to
his cousin's house when he witnessed the attack on Galvez by Aruta and his two
companions.  Rombo did not immediately
report the killing to Jacinto Galvez, explaining that it was already getting
late at that time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Prudencio Fevidal, Municipal Health Officer of Jaro, Leyte
conducted the autopsy on the body and reported that the cause of death was
severe hemorrhage due to four stab wounds in the chest and abdomen.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Aruta took the stand in his defense and swore he was not among
the three men who attacked and killed Galvez.  He said that he was 60 kilometers away at the time of the killing,
enjoying <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>drinking session at
his <u>compadre's</u> house at Cogon, Ormoc City.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Mariano Dagle corroborated this testimony, affirming that Aruta left his house
for Jaro in the morning of December 27, 1982, at about 5 o'clock.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Two other defense witnesses, namely Samuel Dejano and Wilfredo Garrido,
declared that they had seen the killing and that it was committed only by
Quiñones.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Pat. Perfecto Villamor, who investigated the incident that same night, testified
that nobody mentioned Aruta <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>among
the men who had attacked Galvez.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's brief faults the trial court for convicting Aruta
despite the reasonable doubts about his guilt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Specifically, it is pointed out that the four stab wounds were caused by only
one weapon and thus by only one person.  This man was Quiñones and not Aruta.  There were also inconsistencies in the testimonies of the two alleged
eyewitnesses, <u>e.g</u>., who assaulted Galvez and when, the number of thrusts
made, and the place where the stabbings occurred.  It was also strange that Rombo, who claimed to have witnessed the
incident, took all of ten days, no less, to report the matter to the victim's
father.  By contrast, the
accused-appellant's alibi was completely credible and had been corroborated by
the other defense witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:450.75pt">We are not convinced.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled doctrine that the assessment of the credibility
of witnesses is left largely to the trial court because of its opportunity, not
available to the appellate court, to observe the witnesses on the stand and
determine by their demeanor whether they are testifying truthfully or lying in
their teeth.  The findings of the trial
court on this matter are received with much respect and indeed accepted as
conclusive if supported by the evidence of record.  The findings of the trial court in the case at bar are so
substantiated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense theory that only one man inflicted the four stab
wounds was debunked by the medical examiner himself, who declared that the
wounds could have been caused by different persons using identical weapons.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The inconsistencies cited are minor ones and do not detract from the essential
veracity (and concordance) of the separate narrations of the killing.  Rombo explained his delay; it was late that
night and he had to go to his cousin's house, and there was also the natural
reluctance of persons to be involved in court litigations, especially if they
deal with murder and persons not known to be exactly law-abiding.  As for the alibi, it was for the trial judge
to ascertain whether it should be accepted, considering its inherent weakness
and the credibility of the corroborating witnesses.  We shall not disturb his rejection of this defense in light of
his appraisal of the evidence on this matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem that the defense is taking advantage of the
shooting down of Quiñones to exculpate Aruta from the killing of Galvez.  Quiñones has by his death become a
convenient scapegoat who can no longer be punished by the Court.  But we are not deceived.  There is enough evidence that Aruta himself
stabbed Galvez as so did Quiñones and the other attacker.  At any rate, there is no question that a
conspiracy existed between the three assailants, making the act of all the act
of each of them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Under this rule, the acts of the deceased Quiñones are also imputable to Aruta.</p>

<p class="BODY">Motive does not have to be established where the malefactors have
been positively identified, as in this case.  Nevertheless, the reason for the killing of Galvez is not difficult to
discover from the activities of the protagonists.  The motive is traceable to the violent rivalry between two groups
operating the game of <u>masiao</u> in Jaro, with Galvez and the accused on
opposite sides.  This could also have
been the reason for the subsequent killing of Nathaniel Quiñones by an alleged
associate of Galvez in that business.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The killing of Galvez was
attended by treachery and so qualified </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">murder.  The victim was taken completely by surprise
when the three assailants ganged up on him and stabbed him to death.  The killers had insured that their prey
would have no means to defend himself against their sudden attack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The allegation of evident
premeditation has not been proved, but even if it were, the penalty, would
still not change because the maximum penalty of death cannot be imposed in view
of the inhibition in Article III, Section </span>19(1).  Following our ruling in People v. Munoz,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
we approve the imposition of the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">perpetua</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">.  The civil indemnity is,
however, increased to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">P50,000.00
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in accordance with existing
policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the challenged decision is AFFIRMED as
above modified and the appeal DISMISSED, with costs against the accused
appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
