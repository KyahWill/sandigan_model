<p class="BODY">This is a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> and 
<i>mandamus</i> seeking:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) to set aside and nullify the 
Resolution of Judge Jose P. Alejandro dated August 29, 1980, denying 
petitioner's Motion to Dismiss on the ground of non-survival of the money claim 
in Civil Case No. 125887 entitled, <span>"<em>ASIA PACIFIC 
</em></span><em>FINANCE CORPORATION v. E. FRANCISCO LINERS, CO., INC., ELIAS 
</em><span style="font-style: italic;">A. FRANCISCO and JOSEPHINE CRUZ 
MALOLOS<span>,</span></span><span>"</span>pursuant to Sec. 21, Rule 3 of the 
Rules of Court, and (b) to command said Judge to dismiss aforesaid case insofar 
as defendant <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> is 
<span>concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner Josephine Cruz <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> 
(deceased) is represented by her heirs Emmanuel, Maria <span class="SpellE">Marinela</span> <span>and Maria </span>Marjorie, <span>all 
</span>surnamed <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Private respondent Asia Pacific Finance Corporation (herein 
referred to as APCOR) is a quasi-banking institution organized and existing 
under and by virtue of the laws of the Philippines and is partly engaged in the 
discounting of receivables of natural as well as juridical persons.</p>
<p class="BODY">The facts of this case are as follows:</p>
<p class="BODY">On April 16, 1979, APCOR purchased from E. Francisco Liners 
Company, Inc. (herein referred to as Francisco Liner) a postdated Far East Bank 
and Trust Company check numbered 214070 in the amount of P105,000.00 issued in 
the latter's favor by herein petitioner, Josephine Cruz <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The check had a maturity date of 
<st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1979</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>On purchase, Francisco Liners executed a Deed of Assignment of said check 
and as payee, endorsed the same in favor of private respondent before getting 
the discounted proceeds.</p>
<p class="BODY">When deposited on its maturity date, the aforesaid check was 
dishonored for the reason that petitioner's bank account had already been 
closed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, APCOR demanded from Francisco Liners and also 
from petitioner, in her capacity as drawer of the check, the payment of said 
check, but the obligation remained unpaid.</p>
<p class="BODY">As a result, on August 15, 1979, APCOR filed a complaint for sum 
of money with <span>preliminary attachment docketed as </span>Civil Case No. 
125887 in the then CFI of Manila (now RTC) against E. Francisco Liners, Co., 
Inc., Elias A. Francisco <span>(as </span>president of Francisco Liners), and 
herein petitioner (in her capacity as drawer of said check).<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Private Respondent's <span>Memorandum, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 83-84).</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>In the 
complaint, private respondent (then plaintiff) prayed, among others, that a writ 
of preliminary attachment be issued against the properties of the defendants to 
serve as security for the satisfaction of any judgment that may be recovered 
therein (Complaint, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
20-24).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="8">August 23, 
1979</st1:date>, respondent Judge issued an Order of Attachment <span>on the 
grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
</span>that defendants were guilty of fraud in contracting the obligation and 
had removed or disposed of their property, or are about to do so, with intent to 
defraud their creditors, among whom is the plaintiff herein and that there is no 
tangible or valuable security held <span>on </span>to by the plaintiff for the 
collection of defendants' obligation, or for the enforcement of the claim sought 
to be enforced."</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span>(ANNEX B, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, </span>p. 25) and thereafter a Writ of 
Preliminary Attachment <span>was issued.<span>&nbsp; </span>By virtue thereof, the 
levy was annotated upon the residential property of petitioner at 
</span><st1:street><st1:address><span>2555 <span class="SpellE">Taal</span> 
Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span>, <span class="SpellE">Singalong</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span>Manila</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span>, which 
property is covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 129351 of the Registry 
</span><span>of Deeds of </span><span>Manila (ANNEX C, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 26-27).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Josephine Cruz <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> died on 
</span><st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="4"><span>April </span>27, 
1980</st1:date>, and her counsel, on <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1980</st1:date>, filed a Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> the complaint as against her <span>pursuant to Sec. 
21, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court (ANNEX D, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 28-29).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Private respondent opposed the aforementioned motion and argued 
that while it is <span>admitted that </span>the action against the late 
Josephine Cruz <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> is one for recovery of money 
and being such it does not survive, the circumstances obtaining in the case 
place the same among the exceptions to Sec. 21, <span>Rule 3 of </span>the Rules 
of Court (ANNEX E, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 30-31).</p>
<p class="BODY">In a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1980</st1:date>, respondent Judge ruled in favor of private 
respondent and denied the motion to dismiss <span>(ANNEX G, </span><span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. <span>35).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">Without giving due course to the petition, the Court required 
respondents to comment (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 39) which 
order private respondent complied with on March 20, 1981 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 48-58).<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, 
petitioners were required to file a Reply thereto (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 60) which pleading was filed <span>on 
</span><st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1981</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 66-74).</p>
<p class="BODY">Acting on the petition, the Court, on August 3, 1981, 
resolved<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) to give due course to the petition; (b) to consider 
respondent's comment as ANSWER; and (c) to require the parties to file their 
res<span>pective MEMORANDA (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
75).<span>&nbsp; </span>Private respondent filed its Memorandum on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="10"><span>October 20, 
1981</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand petitioners whose 
counsel of record withdrew from the case (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 117) through their new counsel moved that 
they be allowed to adopt by reference as their Memorandum, their basic petition 
and their Reply-Comment already filed with this Court which motion was noted in 
the resolution of the Second </span><span>Division </span><span>of this Court 
dated November 15, 1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
122).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="11">November 21, 
1984</st1:date>, the case was considered submitted for deliberation (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 123).</p>
<p class="BODY">The sole issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not an 
attachment levied on some properties of the defendant constitutes an exception 
to the general rule of non-survival of the money claim as provided for in Sec. 
21, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention is that upon the death of Josephine Cruz 
<span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> on April 27, 1980, respondent Court ceased to 
have any jurisdiction over the subject matter of Civil Case No. 125887, the same 
being a money claim, in so far as Josephine Cruz <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> is concerned, pursuant to Sec. 21, Rule 3 of the 
Rules of Court; that in not dismissing said Civil <span>Case </span>No. 125887, 
respondent judge not only acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, and with 
grave abuse of discretion but also neglected to perform an act which the law 
specifically enjoins him to do to the prejudice and damage of 
petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 4-5).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent argues that Sec. 21, Rule 3 
of the Rules of Court admits of exceptions and one of them is when an attachment 
has been levied on some of the properties of the defendant, on motion of the 
plaintiff, to secure the payment of the latter's money claim in which case the 
pending action should not be dismissed <span>but may be continued against the 
executor or administrator, invoking the ruling in the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Macondray</em></span><em> Co., Inc. v. Dungao</em>, 11 SCRA 72, 
where it was held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"There seems to be no doubt that the action brought by the plaintiff 
corporation is for collection or recovery of money.<span>&nbsp; </span>The prayer of 
the complaint unmistakably appears to be for recovery or collection of sum of 
money.<span>&nbsp; </span>And although at the bottom of the promissory note sued upon 
and before the signature of the obligor there appears the following:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>'The payment of this note is secured by the mortgage on personal 
property", yet it does not appear that the plaintiff sought to foreclose it, as 
the personal property mortgaged to secure the payment of the promissory note is 
not described in the complaint.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>The attachment levied on some 
properties of the defendant, on the plaintiff's motion, to secure payment of its 
money claim, might&nbsp; constitute an exception to the general rule on claims&nbsp; that 
do not survive as provided for in Section 21 of&nbsp; Rule 3, Rules of 
Court</em><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>But after the discharge of the attachment upon 
the filing of a bond </span>by <span>the surety company, the property attached 
becomes free from any specific lien and reverted to its previous condition." 
(<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied).<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">(Private <span>Respondent's Comment, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 48, 55-56).</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Private respondent insists that in above-cited case, although the 
complaint is for the collection of a sum of money, the nature of the same 
changed when a writ of attachment <span>was </span>issued against the properties 
of defendant; that by virtue of said attachment levy a lien was constituted over 
said property levied upon, and only upon the filing of a bond by a Surety 
Company will the attachment be discharged, rendering the property previously 
attached free from any specific lien.<span>&nbsp; </span>With the filing of the 
requisite bond, the attachment was discharged.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, 
in the instant case, no discharge of the attachment has as yet been made, thus, 
the case must be continued, this time against the executor or administrator — 
argues the private respondent.</p>
<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>
<p class="BODY">There is no question that the action in <span>the court below 
</span>is for collection or recovery of money.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is already a settled rule that an action for recovery of money 
or for collection of a debt is one that does not survive and upon the death of 
the defendant the case should be dismissed to be presented in the manner 
especially provided in the Rules of Court (<em>Villegas and Santos v. Zapanta 
and Zorilla</em>, 104 Phil. 973).<span>&nbsp; </span>This is explicitly provided in 
Sec. 21, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court which states that:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 21.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Where claim does not survive.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— When the action 
is for recovery of money, debt or interest thereon, and the defendant dies 
before final judgment in the Court of First Instance, it shall be dismissed to 
be prosecuted in the manner especially provided in these rules."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Said provision of the Rules was in turn interpreted by the Supreme 
Court in <span class="SpellE"><em>Dy</em></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">v. </span><span class="SpellE"><em>Enage</em></span> 
(70 SCRA 117 <span>[1976] </span>stating that "The language of Section 21 of 
Rule 3 is too clear in this respect as to require any interpretation or 
construction.<span>&nbsp; </span>It very explicitly says that 'when the action for 
recovery of money, debt or interest thereon, and the defendant dies before final 
judgment in the Court of First Instance, it shall be dismissed to be prosecuted 
in the manner specially provided by the rules,' meaning, Section 5 of Rule 86 
and its related provisions."</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Earlier, <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.</span> 
119 and 700 of Act 190 (Code of Civil Procedure) from which this Rule was 
derived were interpreted by the Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE"><em>Pabico</em></span><em> v. Jaranilla, et al. </em>(60 Phil. 247, 
251) to be mandatory in character and confers no jurisdiction upon the 
Court.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Moran, Comments on the Rules of 
Court</em>, 1970 ed. p. 215).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The reason for the dismissal of the case is that upon the death of 
the defendant a testate or intestate proceeding shall be instituted in the 
proper court wherein all his creditors must appear and file their claims which 
shall be paid proportionately out of the property left by the deceased (1 Moran, 
<em>Comments on the Rules of Court</em>, 1979 ed., p. 219).</p>
<p class="BODY">The purpose of the rule is to avoid useless duplicity of procedure 
— the ordinary action must be wiped out from the ordinary court (<em>Ignacio v. 
Pampanga Bus Co</em>., <span>May 23, 1963, 20 SCRA 126).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Macondray</em></span><em> v. 
Dungao</em>, <em>supra</em>, cited by private respondent to support its position 
does not fall squarely with the case at bar.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the above-cited case, the facts are as follows:<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span>(1) </span>the promissory note executed by defendant <span class="SpellE">Dungao</span> represented the purchase price of the car and trucks 
which said defendant bought from <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> on 
installment; (2) a writ of attachment was issued on August 16, 1949, <span>but 
this was later on dissolved on September 21, 1949, when the defendant put up a 
surety bond; and (3) the promissory note sued upon in the cited case was secured 
by a mortgage on personal property and the proper action should have been a 
foreclosure of mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the present case, the money claim arose out of a pure and 
simple debt, which as afore-mentioned, under the provision of Rule 3, Sec. 21 of 
the Rules of Court shall be dismissed and must be brought before the probate 
court (1 <span>Moran, </span><em>Comments on the Rules of Court</em>, 1970 ed., 
pp. 215-216).</p>
<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing considerations, the conclusion is 
inevitable that the trial court deviated from the procedure laid down by the 
above-mentioned provisions of the Rules.<span>&nbsp; </span>The fact that a writ 
attachment has been issued cannot provide an excuse for such deviation, as a 
writ of attachment is a remedy ancillary to the principal proceedings.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<em>Gruenberg v. Court of Appeals</em>, 138 SCRA 
<span>471 </span>[1985]).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, if it is mandatory, 
under Rule 3 Sec. 21 of the Rules of Court that the <span>principal proceeding 
or action be dismissed for non-survival of </span>the money claim, the purpose 
of the attachment which is to secure the outcome of the trial no longer exists 
and so with the reasons for the issuance of the writ in this case, insofar as 
the deceased debtor is concerned.</p>
<p class="BODY">Corollary thereto, it has been held that a court order which 
violates the Rules constitutes grave abuse of discretion as it wrecks the 
orderly procedure prescribed for the settlement of claims against deceased 
persons designed to protect the interests of the creditors of the 
decedent.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>Allowing the private respondent to attach 
petitioners' </span><span>properties for the benefit of her </span><span>claim 
</span><span>against the estate would give an undue advantage over other 
creditors against the estate.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>Gruenberg v. Court of Appeals, 
supra</em><span class="GramE">) citing</span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Dy</em></span><em> v. Enage, supra</em>).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Therefore, under the same principle, a writ of attachment already issued 
in connection with a money claim which has to be dismissed because of the death 
of the defendant before final judgment cannot provide an exception to the 
general rule, and must accordingly be dissolved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, (a) the Resolution of respondent Judge 
dated August 29, 1980 is hereby SET ASIDE; (b) the Writ of <i>Mandamus</i> is 
hereby issued commanding the incumbent Judge of the trial court involved to 
dismiss Civil Case No. 125887, but only insofar as Josephine Cruz <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>' heirs are concerned, without prejudice to the 
filing of the claim in the estate proceedings of the deceased and (c) We hereby 
direct the Register of Property of Manila to cancel <span>the </span>Notice of

said Civil Case.</p>
