				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the evening of <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="5">May
 30, 1976</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time>,
four men came to the house of Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> in <span class="SpellE">Uluan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cunig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gattaran</span>,
in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They asked to buy a can of rice, but Bernardo invited them instead to
have supper with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They accepted and
had the repast with Bernardo, his wife, Rosa, his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Felina</span>,
her husband, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Batu</span>,
and their four children.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the meal, the group moved to the balcony, where they
engaged in conversation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They asked
Bernardo if <span style="">he </span>had a<span style=""> </span>gun and the latter said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, the men drew their weapons and one
of them shot Bernardo in the <span style="">face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosa and <span class="SpellE">Felina</span>
were dragged back by their hair as they </span>attempted <span style="">to help Bernardo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somebody clubbed him on the head with a rice
pestle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the men jumped from the
balcony and fled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bernardo died the
following morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, an information for murder was filed against Benito <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Peregrino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Combate</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Berting</span> <span class="SpellE">Caliso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> jumped bail and is still at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caliso</span> died before
the case could be decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1987</st1:date>, the trial court
rendered <span style="">a </span>decision convicting
both <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Combate</span>
of the crime charged and sentenced them to life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were also required to <span style="">pay </span>civil indemnity in the sum of
P30,000.00, plus the costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, both <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Combate</span> contend that they were not sufficiently identified
by the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also
claim that the respondent <span style="">court erred </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">not giving credence to their alibi, </span><span style="">which </span><span style="">established that they were nowhere at the scene of the </span>crime
when it was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The identification <span style="">of </span>the
two was made by Rosa <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felina</span> <span class="SpellE">Batu</span>, who were both
present when <span style="">Bernardo was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They each pointed to <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Combate</span></span><span style=""> </span>as the <span style="">person </span>who shot Bernardo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two witnesses s<span style="">at with the
four assailants at the same table when they took supper together and then
conversed with them at the balcony where they suddenly attacked Bernardo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were both present at the time of the
surprise attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was sufficient
illumination from the kerosene lamps that lit the house.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument that the accused-appellants should have been
identified at a police line-up is not acceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no law requiring a police line-up <span style="">as </span>essential to <span style="">a proper identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it
is not true that the identification was merely suggested to the witnesses </span><span style="">b</span><span style="">y</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
police for the fact is that Rosa immediately recognized the accused-appellants
at the police station.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As the trial court correctly observed:</p>

<blockquote>Rosa <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>, wife <span style="">of </span>the victim, could not have been
mistaken in identifying the accused <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Combate</span> <span style="">as </span>the
one who shot her husband Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> because
(1) she was sitting side by side with her husband at the balcony when <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Combate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Peregrino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span>, Benito <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> and the unnamed companion pulled her husband; (2)
the balcony was lighted with a bottled kerosene lamp; (3) she had the
opportunity to recognize their faces when they all ate together in the kitchen
as she was seated beside <span class="SpellE">Peregrino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Combate</span> was seated in front of her husband and Benito <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> was seated beside her husband; and (4) she was
with her husband at the balcony when the accused arrived in the house and her
husband told them to come <span style="">up </span>their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felina</span> <span class="SpellE">Batu</span> corroborated Rosa <span class="SpellE">Cristobal's</span>
testimony on these particular facts, as she also was in the balcony when <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Combate</span>, <span class="SpellE">Peregrino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abarquez</span>, Benito <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> and the fourth companion arrived in the house; ate
with them in the kitchen; saw her father Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
being pulled by the said four persons; shouting to her mother that her father
was being killed by the four persons as she was only about two meters away from
them; and that the balcony was lighted <span style="">with
</span>a bottled kerosene lamp.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The many inconsistencies <span style="">in
</span>the testimony of both <span style="">Rosa and </span><span class="SpellE">Felina</span> can be explained by the fact that they were <span style="">not</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">experienced in
testifying and were probably confused </span>or <span style="">raffled </span><span style="">when they were
under examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the
discrepancies are minor and do not affect the essential credibility of their
declarations </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">whole.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, </span>and no less important, even the <span style="">accused-</span>appellants admitted that the
witnesses had n<span style="">o </span>motive for
testifying falsely <span style="">ag</span><span style="">ainst </span><span style="">them as they had not known each other before the commission of the
crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The alibi of the accused-appellants is not persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to them, they were both in Rosario,
<span class="SpellE">Lallo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, when the
crime was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They presented witnesses
to corroborate their statement that they were both attending a fiesta at that
time and until<span style=""> dawn and that they went
to a baptismal party the following day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That may be </span><span style="">so, </span><span style="">but that does not mean they could not have
gone first to Bernardo's house before attending the </span>fiesta, considering
that the distances between Rosario and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cunig</span></span><span style=""> could have been negotiated </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">about an hour and a
half.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More significantly, the two
accused-appellants were </span>positively identified by the two prosecution
witnesses who <span style="">actually saw the slaying
of Bernardo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the four assailants acted <span style="">in </span>conspiracy with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was evident from the time they went to
Bernardo's house pretending to look for a <span style="">lost
<span class="SpellE">carabao</span> and, more convincingly, when they moved in
concert to kill Bernardo even as the two witnesses were pulled away </span>by
the hair, after <span style="">which all four of them
fled </span>together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As conspirators,
they are each liable for the attack on<span style=""> </span>Bernardo,
regardless of who actually pulled the trigger or wielded the club that killed
him.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was also correctly held by the trial judge that the killing
was qualified by treachery, as the attack took Bernardo completely by surprise,
let alone the further fact that two of the men prevented Rosa and <span class="SpellE">Felina</span> from succoring the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailants clearly took steps to insure
the commission of the offense without risk <span style="">to </span>themselves arising from the defense the offended party might
make.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, nighttime should not have
been considered <span style="">a </span>separate
aggravating circumstance as this was absorbed by <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">alevosia</span></u></span><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
But dwelling was properly taken into account as the murder was committed in the
house of the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appropriate penalty <span style="">would
</span>have been death, but as <span style="">this is</span>
no longer allowed under the Constitution, <span style="">it
is </span>reduced to reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conformably to the resolution of the Court
dated <st1:date year="1990" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1990</st1:date>, the
civil indemnity is increased to P50,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the
decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED <span style="">as
</span>above modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>
