In October 1980 and November 1980, petitioner Richard C. Hoey filed 
complaints with the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Rizal against 
Raul Leveriza, Jr., and Henry Unson, Jr., officers of Manotoc 
Securities, for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, otherwise known as 
the Bouncing Check Law. After preliminary investigation, the 
investigation fiscal found probable cause and filed the informations in 
the then Court of First Instance of Rizal, in Pasig, docketed as 
Criminal Cases Nos. 44548 and 44549.
<p>
Accused Raul Leveriza, Jr. filed a Motion for Reconsideration in both 
cases with the Office of the Provincial Fiscal which, after a 
reinvestigation of the two (2) cases was made, corresponding Motions to 
Dismiss, dated June 7, 1982, were presented in court for the reason that

  <p> "4.  After analysing all the allegations of the accused in the 
Motion for Reconsideration and the oppositions filed thereto by the 
offended party, the undersigned finds that the subject matter in this 
case is a guarantee check and as such is not covered by Batas Pambansa 
Bilang 22, hence the Information filed in this case does not charge an 
offense and should therefore be dismissed, a copy of the Resolution of 
the undersigned dated May 31, 1982 duly approved by Provincial Fiscal B.
 Jose Castillo recommending for the dismissal of this case is hereto 
attached as Annex 'A' and made an integral part hereof; </p>
  <p> "5.  Although it was only accused Raul Leveriza, Jr. who filed the
 instant Motion for Reconsideration since the Information filed in this 
case does not charge an offense the Information should be dismissed not 
only against Raul Leveriza, Jr but also against his co-accused Enrique 
Unson, Jr." (p. 24, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner Richard C. Hoey, complainant in the two (2) Criminal Cases 
Nos. 44548 and 44549, opposed the Motion to Dismiss, stating among 
others that -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Raul Leveriza, Jr. and Henry Unson, Jr. were officers of Manotoc 
Securities Inc. That Raul Leveriza, Jr. had diverted and converted the 
public funds entrusted to the corporation by the public as Manotoc 
Securities was engaged in the business of soliciting money from the 
public to finance client accounts in their stock-market operations who 
wanted to buy or margin viable securities. That through his position as 
Executive Vice-President, he was able to divert those funds to the 
amount of P10,422,573.00 to finance his own, his family's and 
friends/projects and or corporations to the prejudice and damage of the 
public investors such as RICHARD C. HOEY the complainant herein. </p>
  <p> "That as part of his scheme he and accused Henry Unson caused to 
issue and signed two (2) checks to the order of the complainant herein 
which bounced due to a '<em>closed account</em>.' </p>
  <p> "That IBAA Check No. HO-01293423 dated 6 November 1979 for the 
amount of P59,508.00 bounced due to a closed account as well as IBAA 
Check No. HO-01293422 dated November 14, 1979 for the amount of 
P82,634.20. </p>
  <p> "The signatories were Raul Leveriza, Jr. and Henry Unson, Jr. for both checks filed as Criminal Cases Nos. 44548 and 44549. </p>
  <p> "Though the accused Raul Leveriza, Jr. suddenly moved out of his 
known residence at Marbella I Condominium, Roxas Blvd, without leaving a
 forwardÂ­ing address in order not to be found, his lawyers were 
furnished copies as to the Rejoinder-Affidavits of the complainant 
during the preliminary investigation. The accused Raul Leveriza, Jr 
chose to remain unrepresented in that proceeding. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
"Upon termination of the preliminary investigation and after the filing 
of the information, in order to delay proceedings, his lawyers suddenly 
appeared and filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was granted.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That there were two issues raised in the re-investigation namely: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        1.  Whether or not a crossed check is a check;
    </p>
    <p> 2.  Whether or not a check issued for guarantee is punishable under Batas Pambansa Bilang 22." (pp. 30-30-A, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
Before the lower court could act on the Motion to Dismiss, Mr. Richard C. Hoey filed this petition with prayer that a writ of <em>mandamus </em>with
 prohibition be issued ordering the Honorable Provincial Fiscal of Rizal
 to prosecute the two cases for violation of the Bouncing Check Law and 
to desist from pursuing, or "to withdraw the two Motions to Dismiss 
thereby preventing the dismissal of the cases and causing the 
continuation of the trial on the merits." (p. 5, <em>Rollo</em>)
</p><p>
Section 4, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court, specifically provides
 that "all criminal actions either commenced by complaint or by 
information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the 
fiscal." Thus, it is clear that the question of instituting a criminal 
charge in court is one addressed to the sound discretion of the 
investigating fiscal; and, the assumption is, the information he lodges 
in court is supported by facts brought about by an inquiry made by him. 
On the other hand, this Court has ruled in Alberto vs. de la Cruz, 98 
SCRA 406, that "a fiscal by the nature of his office, is under no 
compulsion to file a particular criminal information where he is not 
convinced that he has evidence to support the allegations thereof. 
Although this power and prerogative of the Fiscal, to determine whether 
or not the evidence at hand is sufficient to form a reasonable belief 
that a person committed an offense, is not absolute and subject to 
judicial review, it would be embarrassing for the prosecuting attorney 
to be compelled to prosecute a case when he is in no position to do so, 
because in his opinion, he does not have the necessary evidence to 
secure a conviction, or he is not convinced of the merits of the case. 
The better procedure would be to appeal the Fiscal's decision to the 
Ministry of Justice and/or ask for a special prosecutor."
</p><p>
However, in cases where informations have already been filed in court, 
the latter acquires jurisdiction over them. Otherwise stated, the 
jurisdiction of the court became vested upon the filing of the 
information and, once acquired, its jurisdiction continues until the 
termination of the case.
</p><p>
In the two (2) criminal cases in question, it is a fact that the 
informations have already been filed in court. It should therefore 
dispose of them, one way or the other, resolving all motions brought 
before it including the Motions to Dismiss, dated June 7, 1982, filed by
 the Fiscal, or deciding the cases on the merit. The prosecuting fiscal 
has no more control over said cases, the same having been transferred to
 the court. We have a situation where, akin to the pronouncement made by
 the present Chief Justice in Lansang vs. Garcia, 42 SCRA 452, whenever a
 formal complaint is presented in court against an individual, the court
 steps in and takes control thereof until the same is finally disposed 
of.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Fernando, C.J., Makasiar, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Gutierrez, Jr., De la Fuente</em>, and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, J.,</em> files a separate concurrence.

CONCURRING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
TEEHANKEE, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I concur. <em>Mandamus </em>on the part of the offended party-petitioner
 that respondent Provincial Fiscal be ordered to prosecute the two 
pending criminal cases for violation of the Bouncing Check Law and to 
desist from pursuing the pending motions to dismiss filed by him with 
the trial court will not lie. The Court's decision correctly states (at 
page 5) that the informations have already been filed in court which has
 now acquired jurisdiction over the two criminal cases which shall 
continue until the termination of the cases and that, therefore, it is 
the said court which "should therefore dispose of them, one way or the 
other, resolving all motions brought before it including the Motions to 
Dismiss dated June 7, 1982 filed by the Fiscal, or deciding the cases on
 the merits. The prosecuting fiscal has no more control over said cases,
 the same having been transferred to the court."
</p><p>
This is but in line with the leading case of <em>Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Bataan vs. Dollete</em>
 (103 Phil. 914), wherein this Court upheld the action of the therein 
respondent judge in denying the petiÂ­tioner fiscal's motion for 
dismissal of the criminal case as "wholly within his right and 
discretion," but set aside the second part of respondent judge's order 
directing petitioner fiscal to file the corresponding information and 
instead "suggested that the respondent judge either order the offended 
parties to submit to an investigation to be conducted by petitioner, so 
that the latter may gather the necessary evidence to support the 
prosecution, or to convince himself of the merits of the case, from the 
point of view of the Government, or else, considering the attitude of 
the petitioner, and to avoid embarrassment, to have either the trial 
court or the offended parties make manifestations to the DepartÂ­ment of 
Justice for the designation of an Acting Provincial Fiscal."
</p><p>
The present petition which would bypass the trial court is, therefore, 
properly dismissed for prematurity. The pending motions to dismiss the 
two criminal cases have been properly addressed by respondent fiscal to 
the trial court which should now properly resolve them. The questions 
presented are based on documentary evidence and it is up to the trial 
court to determine the merits thereof on the basis of the documented 
facts and the applicable law and to grant or deny the motions to dismiss
 accordingly.
