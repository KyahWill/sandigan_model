				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">EUGENIO JURILLA, MARCIANO MEDALLA, BERNARDO NAZAL, REY MEDINA, MELENCIO
CASTELO, GODOFREDO LIBAN and ANTONIO V. HERNANDEZ were among the candidates in
the 11 May 1992 synchronized elections for the <span style="">six (6) </span>positions of councilor for the Second District of Quezon
City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 23 March 1992, respondent Antonio V. Hernandez filed with the
Commission on Elections his certificate of candidacy for one of the contested
seats.  In Item No. 6 of his certificate
he gave as his address "B 26, L 1 New Capitol Estates, Quezon City."
However, he did not indicate on the space provided in Item No. 12 therein his
Precinct Number and the particular Barangay where he was a registered voter.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
His biodata submitted together with his certificate of candidacy gave his
address as "Acacia Street, Mariana, Quezon City,"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> which
is part of the Fourth District of Quezon City.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> In
other words, his certificate of candidacy and his biodata filed with COMELEC
did not expressly state that he was a registered voter of Quezon City or that
he was a resident of the Second District thereof within the purview of Sec. 39,
par. (a), of the Local Government Code of 1991, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 39.  <i><span style="">Qualifications</span></i><span style=""> - (a) </span>An elective local official must
be a citizen of the Philippines; a registered voter in the barangay,
municipality, city, or province or, in the case of a member of the sangguniang
panlalawigan, sangguniang panglunsod, or sangguniang bayan, the district where
he intends to be elected; a resident therein for at least one (1) year
immediately preceding the day of the election; and able to read and write Filipino
or any other local language or dialect.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the seeming
deficiency in the certificate of candidacy of private respondent, petitioners
herein challenged his qualification before public respondent </span><span style="">COMELEC </span><span style="">explaining however that since they became aware of the grounds for
private respondent's qualification only after the elections, they chose to file
their petition under Rule 25 of the </span><span style="">COMELEC </span><span style="">Rules of
Procedure authorizing the filing of such petition at any day after the last day
for filing certificates of candidacy but not later than the date of
proclamation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 2 June </span><span style="">1992, COMELEC </span><span style="">promulgated its questioned resolution denying the petition for
disqualification for being filed outside the reglementary period under Sec. 5
of RA 6646, which pertains to nuisance candidates.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Hence the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>
imputing grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction on the
part of </span><span style="">COMELEC </span><span style="">in issuing the assailed resolution of </span><span style="">2 </span><span style="">June
</span><span style="">1992.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may be gleaned from
the provisions of Sec. 39, par. (a), of the Local Government Code of </span><span style="">1991, </span><span style="">earlier quoted, that the law does not specifically require that the
candidate must state in his certificate of candidacy his Precinct Number and
the Barangay where he is registered.  Apparently, it is enough that he is actually registered as a voter in
the precinct where he intends to vote, which should be within the district
where he is running for office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bench, his
failure to so state in his certificate of candidacy his Precinct Number is
satisfactorily explained by him in that at the time he filed his certificate he
was not yet assigned a particular Precinct Number in the Second District of
Quezon City.  He was formerly a
registered voter of Manila, although for the past two (2) years prior to the
elections he was already a resident of "B 26, </span>L 1 <span style="">New Capitol Estates," admittedly within
the Second District of Quezon City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his Petition for
Inclusion in the Registry of Registered Voters of Second District, Quezon City,
private respondent explained that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x x x since 1990, he is a resident of Block 26, Lot 1, New Capitol
Estates (formerly Capitol Bliss), Barangay Batasan Hills, Quezon City; that he
failed to register as a voter during the general registration held at Quezon
City on March 14 and 15, 1992 because he was sick of Acute Gastroenteritis as
evidenced by the Medical Certificate duly issued by Dr. Angelito S. Regala,
M.D., of the Family Clinic, Inc.; that he was a previous registered voter of
Manila x x x x that he would like to transfer and to register as voter in
Quezon City, particularly at Precinct 233-B, New Capitol Estates, Quezon City
because he is now a resident of Quezon City.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Confirming the explanation of private respondent, Barangay
Captain Manuel Laxina testified that he was the Barangay Captain of New Capitol
Estates (formerly Capitol Bliss), Barangay Batasan, Quezon City, since 8
October 1986; that petitioner (private respondent herein) was a resident of New
Capitol Estates for two (2) years as of the time he testified.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due notice and hearing, and without any written opposition,
the petition was granted by the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City the
dispositive portion of the order stating that -</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE x x x and it appearing that petitioner Antonio Viana Hernandez
also known as Anthony Alonzo possesses all the qualifications and none of the
disqualifications of a voter plus the fact that there was no opposition at all,
the court resolves to grant his petition.  Accordingly, the Chairman of the Board of Election Inspectors of
Precinct No. 233-B, New Capitol Estates (formerly Capitol Bliss), Quezon City,
is hereby ordered to include in the official list of voters the name of Antonio
Viana Hernandez also known as Anthony Alonzo and to allow him to cast his vote
in the coming May 1992 election.  Let
copy of the Order be furnished the Chairman of the Board of Election Inspectors
of Precinct 233-B, New Capitol Estates formerly Capitol Bliss, Quezon City,
Election Registrar, Commission on Elections, Quezon City, Chairman of the
Commission on Elections, Intramuros, Manila, for their information and
guidance.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, as a registered voter of Precinct Number 233-B, New
Capitol Estates, Quezon City, as judicially confirmed, the COMELEC had no other
recourse but to declare that he was eligible, hence qualified, to run for the
position in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">COMELEC </span>referred to
the action taken by petitioners herein as one to declare private respondent a
"nuisance candidate" and intimating that they should have instead
petitioned <span style="">COMELEC </span><u>to </u><u><span style="">refuse to give due course to or cancel the
certificate of candidacy of private respondent</span></u><span style="">, </span>citing Sec. 69 of BP Blg. 881, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 69.  <i><span style="">Nuisance candidates</span></i><span style="">. - </span>The Commission may, <i><span style="">motu proprio</span></i><span style=""> </span>or upon a verified petition of an interested party, refuse to
give due course to or cancel a certificate of candidacy if it is shown that
said certificate has been filed to put the election process in mockery or
disrepute or to cause confusion among the voters by the similarity of the names
of the registered candidates or by other circumstances or acts which clearly
demonstrate that the candidate has no bona fide intention to run for the office
for which the certificate of candidacy has been filed and thus prevent a
faithful determination of the true will of the electorate.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the holding of <span style="">COMELEC
</span>that private respondent Hernandez was a "nuisance candidate"
is erroneous because, tested against the provisions of Sec. 69, there is no way
by which we can categorize him as a "nuisance candidate," hence, the
procedure therein provided could not have been properly invoked by petitioners
herein.  Neither could they apply Rule
25 of the <span style="">COMELEC </span>Rules of
Procedure which would require such petition to be filed <u><span style="">at any day after the last day for filing
certificates of candidacy but not later than the date of proclamation</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While <span style="">COMELEC </span>therefore
proceeded on the erroneous premise that private respondent Hernandez should be
treated as a "nuisance candidate" as already shown, nevertheless its
conclusion to dismiss the petition and give due course to the candidacy of
private respondent he being a qualified voter of Precinct No. 233-B, New
Capitol Estates, Barangay Batasan Hills, must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, there being no grave abuse of discretion committed
by respondent Commission on Elections in issuing its questioned resolution of 2
June 1992, the instant petition is dismissed.</p>
