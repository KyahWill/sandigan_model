				<H3>MARIA LUISA ESTOESTA, PETITIONER. VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS, PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND GERRY R. GONZALES, PRESIDING JUDGE, MTC, BR. 76, MARIKINA, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The legal effect of the appearance a litigant in his own behalf
is the focus of controversy in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was <span style="">charged
with </span>the crime of slight physical injuries committed against <span class="SpellE">Perla</span> Y. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> in <span class="GramE">an information</span> filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>, Metro Manila.<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>By</span> the same token, on a
countercharge of petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Perla</span> Y. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> was charged in <span class="GramE">an information</span>
for the same offense before the same court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases were consolidated and after a joint trial on the merits
where both parties were duly represented by counsel, the trial court rendered a
decision dated January 12, 1989 convicting the petitioner of the crime charged
and sentencing her to suffer imprisonment of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">menor</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>in its medium period of eleven (11)
days to twenty (20) days but acquitting <span class="SpellE">Perla</span> Y. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span> with costs <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span><span style=""> </span>in both cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied therewith petitioner through counsel filed a notice
of appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> wherein in due course
the judgment appealed from was modified as to the penalty by imposing a
straight penalty of eleven (11) days imprisonment.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration filed by counsel for petitioner was
denied by the Regional Trial Court on <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="8">August
 30, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 20, 1989, petitioner, without <span style="">the </span>assistance of counsel, filed with
the Court of Appeals a motion for extension of time of thirty (30) days from
September 30, 1989 <span style="">or</span> up to
October 19, 1989 within which to file a petition for review on the ground that
she has to look for another lawyer to represent her and prepare the necessary
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted by the
appellate court in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="10">October
 16, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, instead of filing the petition for review, petitioner in
her own behalf filed on October 9, 1989 a written manifestation and motion to
withdraw petition <span style="">for </span>review for
the purpose of <span style="">applying </span>for
probation in the court of origin, “she being a first offender and possesses
(sic) all the qualifications and none of the disqualifications provided for
under the said probation law."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The motion was granted by the appellate court in a <span style="">resolution </span>dated <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="10">October
 24, 1989</st1:date>, copy of which was received by petitioner <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The division </span>clerk
of court of the Court of Appeals made the entry of judgment on <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 17, 1989, the petitioner filed a joint or alternative
motion for reconsideration and reinstatement of petition for review and
petition for relief from judgment with prayer for a temporary restraining order
based on the ground that the motion to withdraw the petition for review was
filed without the advice of her lawyer and under the honest impression that her
application for probation pending with the lower court will be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1990</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals denied the said motion for lack of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> with prayer
for restraining order dated <st1:date year="1990" day="10" month="3">March 10,
 1990</st1:date> predicated on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>“I. THE HON. COURT OF<span style=""> </span>APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION
AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION IN DENYING YOUR PETITIONER’S MOTION TO
REINSTATE PETITION FOR REVIEW IN TOTAL DISREGARD OF THE DOCTRINES ENUNCIATED IN
THE CASES OF DELGADO VS. <span class="GramE">COURT OF APPEALS, 145 SCRA 357;
REPUBLIC VS.</span> <span class="GramE">ARRO, 150 SCRA 626 AND SILVESTRE VS.</span>

<blockquote>II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE DENIAL OF YOUR PETITIONER'S MOTION TO
REINSTATE HER PETITION FOR REVIEW WOULD PERPETUATE THE SERIOUS AND PATENT
ERRORS COMMITTED BY THE LOWER COURT ESPECIALLY AS TO THE ALLEGED <st1:place>OPPORTUNITY</st1:place>
TO OBSERVE WITNESSES' DEMEANOR WHEN THE JUDGE WHO PENNED THE DECISION WAS NOT
THE SAME JUDGE WHO HEARD THE WITNESSES (WHO) TESTIFIED."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 34, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 34.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>By whom litigation conducted</u>. - In the
court of a justice of the peace a party may conduct his litigation in person,
with the aid of an agent or friend appointed by him for that purpose, or with
the aid of an attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any other
court, a party may conduct his litigation personally or by aid of an attorney,
and his appearance must be either personal or by a duly authorized member of
the bar."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing provision of the rule, it is clear that a
party in a case may conduct <span class="GramE">a litigation</span> either
personally or by an attorney in the cour<span style="">t</span>s.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may also be assisted by an agent or friend
for the purpose in the inferior courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And even if a party may have chosen to appear through counsel, he may at
any time dispense with the services of his/her lawyer and prosecute or defend
his/her<span style=""> </span>case personally.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case the Court notes that before the Metropolitan Trial
Court and the Regional Trial Court, the petitioner was duly represented by
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when she decided to
elevate her case to the Court of Appeals she chose to handle her case
personally, first, by asking for an extension of time within which to file a
petition for review and second, by filing thereafter a petition to withdraw the
petition <span style="">for </span>review to enable her
to apply for probation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
under Section 4 of Presidential <span style="">Decree </span>No
1257 as amended <span style="">by </span>Presidential
Decree No. 1990 dated <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1985</st1:date>,
it is specifically provided <span style="">that
"no </span>application for probation shall be entertained or granted when <span style="">the </span>defendant has perfected the appeal
from the judgment of conviction.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, <span style="">as </span>petitioner
failed <span style="">to </span>secure favorable action
on her application for probation, she filed a motion for reconsideration <span style="">of</span> the resolution o<span style="">f </span>the appellate court - granting her
motion to withdraw - or in the alternative, a petition for relief from judgment
alleging that she was not duly assisted by counsel then and that she was under
the<span style=""> </span>honest impression that she
could apply for pro<span style="">b</span>ation, and
that if the motion is granted, petitioner could very well demonstrate that the
assessment <span style="">of the credibility of the </span>witnesses
by the lower court which was relied upon by the Regional Trial Court is
misplaced as the one who decided the case is different from the judge who heard
the ca<span style="">se.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The said alternative motion for reconsideration or petition for <span style="">relief</span> from judgment, however, was
filed only on <st1:date year="1989" day="17" month="11">November <span style="">17, </span>1989</st1:date>, beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner received a copy of the questioned resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1989</st1:date> on <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="10">October 30,<span style=""> </span>1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Hence, </span>said<span style=""> </span>resolution had become final by the time petitioner filed her
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the alternative
petition for relief from judgment is not accompanied by an affidavit of merit
as required by the rules.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court emphasizes the fact that it is always better for a
party to be represented by counsel in <span class="GramE">a litigation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, it is the right of such party
to appear in his or her own behalf to prosecute or defend cause in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If in the process petitioner suffered
reverses, she has only herself to blame.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She is bound by the consequences of her own voluntary act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of conviction of the petitioner for slight physical
injuries inflicted by the petitioner upon the offended party was arrived at by
the Regional Trial Court based <span style="">on </span>the
testimony of the offended party corroborated by her witnesses and proof of the
injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such judgment has become final
and petitioner must now face the reality of submitting herself for its
execution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED without pronouncement <span style="">as </span>to costs.</p>
