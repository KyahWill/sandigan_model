				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for review, the petitioner seeks the reversal of
the Workmen's Compensation Commission decision which affirmed the dismissal by
the labor referee of her claim for death compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's son, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Tortal</span>,
was a farm laborer of Hacienda Celina at E.B. <span class="SpellE">Magalona</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental since 1972 up to the time of his
death on <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1973</st1:date>. At
the time of his death, he was earning a daily wage of P8.00. The cause of death
is stated in the death certificate as "hypertension cerebral."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1973</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed a notice and claim for death compensation with the
Workmen's Compensation Commission, Sub-Regional Office No. <span class="GramE">VII
at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bacolod</span></span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1973</st1:date>,
the sub-regional office furnished the private respondent, by registered mail, a
copy of the notice and claim for death compensation as well as a blank form of
the employer's report of accident or sickness for him to accomplish but these
were returned to the sender as "unclaimed." However, on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1974</st1:date>, the private respondent <span class="GramE">submitted his employer's report <span class="SpellE">controverting</span>
the cause of death as neither service incurred nor</span> service aggravated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1974</st1:date>, but on the day of the hearing both parties
failed to appear.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties submitted their respective memoranda, the
referee of the sub-regional office dismissed the claim for lack of merit. After
denying the petitioner's motion for reconsideration, the referee elevated the
case to the Workmen's Compensation Commission for review. The <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the decision by the latter office prompted
the petitioner to file the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Workmen's Compensation Commission in affirming the dismissal
of the claim ruled that "(t<span class="GramE">)here</span> is no dispute
that Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Tortal</span> died due to 'Hypertension,
Cerebral' on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1975</st1:date>
(should be <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1973</st1:date>). However,
the herein claimant failed to established (sic) by substantial evidence the
causal connection between the deceased's illness and his work as laborer of
respondent."</p>

<p class="BODY">The late Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Tortal</span> died in 1973. Benefits
based on his death are, therefore, governed by the former Workmen's
Compensation Act or Act 3428 as amended. Because of the decisions interpreting
the provisions of the old law on presumption of compensability and the effects
of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, we are constrained to grant the
petition and to reverse the questioned decision. In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Salanguit</u></span><u> v. Workmen's Compensation</u> (90 SCRA
228) we ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> -
The record discloses that the illness of Juan <span class="SpellE">Salanguit</span>,
petitioner herein, supervened during his employ­ment with the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(Bureau of Public Highways). Hence, there is a disputable presumption that the
claim is compensable. <u>The claimant is relieved of the duty to prove
causation as it is then legally presumed that the illness arose out of the
employment</u>. To the employer is shifted the burden of proof to establish
that the illness is non-compensable." (<span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>
v. Workmen's Compensation Commission, 83 SCRA 721) [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">This rule was reiterated in the case of <u>Enrique,
Sr. v. Republic</u>, (93 SCRA 836) where this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it
can be correctly said that petitioner's hypertension supervened in the course
of his employment, and in accordance with the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
Section 44(1) in relation to Section 2. <span class="GramE">(SECTION 2.</span> <span class="GramE">Ground for Compensation.</span> <span class="GramE">- When an
employee suffers personal injury, or contracts tuberculo­sis or other illness
directly caused by such employment, or either aggravated by or the result of
the nature of such employment, his employer shall pay compensation in the sums
and to the persons hereinafter specified.'</span> It is presumed that
petitioner's hypertension was service-connected, and therefore compensable. This,
We have consistently held in a number of cases (Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
Don Pedro v. <span class="SpellE">Agno</span> and WCC, 12 SCRA 178; <span class="SpellE">Abana</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>, 22 SCRA
1278; <span class="SpellE">Legason</span> v. WCC, 75 SCRA 213; <span class="SpellE">Baterna</span> v. WCC, 75 SCRA 409; <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> v. WCC, 75 SCRA 679; Guevara v. Republic,
77 SCRA 292; <span class="SpellE">Caling</span> v. WCC, 77 SCRA 311; Evangelista
v. WCC, 77 SCRA 497; Pillsbury Mindanao Flour Milling Co., Inc. v. Murillo, 81
SCRA 307; <span class="SpellE">Lamco</span> v. WCC, L-4375, July 31, 1978; <span class="SpellE">Saril</span> v. WCC, L-43204, July 31, 1978) and the burden of
proof is shifted to the employer to show by substantial evidence that while the
illness sub­ject of the claim <span class="SpellE">supervenee</span> in the
course of employment, it does not necessarily follow that it also arose from
such employment or was at least aggravated by it. (<span class="SpellE">Lizardo</span>
v. WEE, L-42995, <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1979</st1:date>.

vs. WCC, 58 SCRA 138; Maria Cristina Fertilizer Corp. v. WCC, 60 SCRA 228; <span class="SpellE">Ruelan</span> v. RP, 70 SCRA 615). x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately for the employer, the records are bereft of
evidence to overcome the presumption of compensability. The allegation that <span class="SpellE">Tortal</span> had a drinking spree the evening before his death
does not preclude his hypertension having been caused or aggravated by or
having resulted from the nature of his farm work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisprudence explaining the effect of non-<span class="SpellE">controversion</span> is similarly emphatic in favoring the
deceased worker. Under the former Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, if an
employer somehow overlooks or neglects to controvert the right to compensation
within fourteen (14) days from the death of the employee or ten (10) days from
know­ledge thereof, the employer is considered, with an effect approaching
conclusiveness, as having waived or renounced his <span class="SpellE">defensed</span>.
This was the applicable law. We are constrained to apply it. In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Jesalva</u></span><u> v. Workmen's Compensation Commission</u>,
(95 SCRA 597) this court declared:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Moreover, the records of the case reveal that respondent employer never
complied with its obligations under Sections 37 and 54 of the Act of reporting
to the Commission within fourteen days from occurrence of the injury or death
of its employee or within ten (10) days from knowledge thereof; which
non-compliance generates [a] the <u>loss</u> of the right to controvert the
claim on jurisdic­tional grounds, and the employer cannot be subsequently heard
to complain that the law was strictly construed against him (Victory Ship­ping
Lines, Inc. v. WCC, 106 Phil. 550 [1059]); [b] the <u>renunciation</u> of the
right to controvert the claim, barring all defenses available with­out
exception (National Development Co. v. WCC, 10 SCRA 696 [1964]), thereby
constructively admitting that is <span class="SpellE">is</span> compensable; and
[c] the <u>waiver</u> of the defense that the claim for compensation was not
filed within the statutory period (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> v. WCC, 38 SCRA 567,
575-576 [1971]; Manila Railroad Co. v. WCC, 10 SCRA 41 [1964]). Consequently,
herein respondent employer is barred from raising any defense to defeat peti­tioner's
claim."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Under the afore-quoted ruling, the <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> of the claim as neither service incurred nor
service aggravated filed by the private respondent only on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1974</st1:date>, was a sadly belated act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again the records are bereft of proof to support timely <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>, apart from a self-serving allegation that
the employer learned of the death only when asked to accomplish WCC Form No. 3.
The fact that <span class="SpellE">Tortal</span> died on the hacienda, that it is
in the normal course of events to immediately report such a tragedy to the
employer and that his daily wage of P8.00 must have been stricken off the
payroll and considering further the presumptions under the former law, we rule
that there was no timely and valid <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>.</p>

Commission dated <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="12">December 30, 1975</st1:date>
