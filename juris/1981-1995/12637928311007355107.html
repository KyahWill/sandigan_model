<p class="BODY">It appears that on January 16, 1974, Knitting, Inc. through its
treasurer Kiok Lay, executed a Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage in
favor of the Consolidated Bank and Trust Corporation (Solidbank) to secure a
loan of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P900,000.00.  </span>The mortgage was constituted on two
(2) parcels of land <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">covered by </span>T.C.T.
Nos. 18112 and 14985 and on the building and improvements existing thereon, as
well as on various types of machineries.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 30, 1979, Knitting again through its treasurer Kiok Lay,
executed an Amendment to the Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage to secure
additional credit facilities worth P2,500,000.00.  Knitting thus obtained an additional loan of P2,500,000.00 for which
it executed three (3) promissory notes all signed by Kiok Lay.  The Amendment covered the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">same </span>properties described in the first
Deed of Mortgage and various types of machineries which might thereafter be
acquired by Knitting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Letters of credit were extended to Knitting in June, 1980, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">September 16, 1980, August 12, 1980 and
October 3, 1980, by virtue of which Solidbank paid P1,796,768.70 to various
suppliers of Knitting </span>on the basis of sight drafts which the suppliers
issued.  Knitting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">took possession of the goods delivered </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the suppliers after executing </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">trust receipts, binding </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">itself to hold the goods covered by the
receipts in favor of Solidbank, to sell them and deliver the proceeds to
Solidbank or to return the goods to it if not sold.  In addition to the Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage, Kiok
Lay and Manuel Kiok executed a continuing guaranty constituting themselves as
sureties for the payment of the </span>loan.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Knitting defaulted in the
payment of its obligations, for which reason, Solidbank asked the sheriff to
foreclose the mortgage.  The</span>
total obligation of Knitting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>of
November 1981 amounted to P4,108,831.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">To stop and prevent the
ensuing foreclosure, Knitting, Kiok Lay and Manuel Kiok filed a petition for </span>injunction
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with the Court of First Instance of
Pasay City.  The case was docketed as </span>Civil
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Case No. 9609-P and raffled to Judge
Manuel V. Romillo, Jr.  They alleged
that the Deed of Real Estate and Chattel Mortgage executed on January 16, 1974
was null and void because Kiok Lay who negotiated for the loan was not author­ized
to do so, either under the Articles of Incorporation of Knitting or by its
Board of Directors; that Kiok Lay had already paid the sum of </span>P900,000.00
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">from his personal funds; that Solidbank
extended the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">addi­</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">tional loan of P2,500,000.00 to Kiok Lay
after the obligation secured by the first mortgage had been paid and despite
knowledge of the fact </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that Kiok </span>Lay
was not authorized to enter into such contract.  It was further <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">alleged
that Kiok Lay was allegedly and maliciously made to sign the Amendment to </span>the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Real Estate and </span>Chattel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Mortgage; that the said </span>Deed of
Mortgage could no longer be amended because it had already been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fully paid for by Kiok Lay; that because of
the false statement made under oath by Solidbank's comptroller Corazon R.
Dayco, the Clerk of </span>Court and the Sheriff of Pasay City were misled into
issuing a Notice of Sheriff's Sale on November 21, 1981 which was published in
the Nuevo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Horizonte issues of November
14 and 21, 1981.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On November 27, 1981,
Judge Romillo issued a temporary restrain­</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ing order </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">enjoining
Solidbank from further publishing </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">notice of sale and from
proceeding with the sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In due time, Solidbank
filed its answer.  It alleged that Kiok
Lay was authorized </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">various resolutions of the board of directors
of Knitting to negotiate loans with Solidbank, to sign documents and other
papers in connection with such loans and particularly to mortgage cor</span>porate
assets and to sign checks.  It also
claimed that Knitting benefited from the loans and therefore was estopped to
deny them.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">As a </span>counter­claim, Solidbank prayed that Knitting be ordered to
pay compensatory, exemplary and/or liquidated damages <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">as </span>stipulated in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
promissory </span>notes because of the filing of a baseless and frivolous
action and 10% of the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">due </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span>attorney's fees.  In the alternative, it asked that Knitting
be ordered to pay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P2,500,000.00 </span>with
interest at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>rate of 3% per
annum until the amount was fully paid and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">10%
of the </span>amount due by way of attorney's fees; the sum of P1,796,768.78
covered by trust receipts with interest at the rate of 14% per annum plus 10%
attorney's fees and 3% penalty agreed upon in case of litigation.  Solidbank also prayed for the attachment of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>properties of Knitting, as
security for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>satis­faction
of its obligation on the ground that said Knitting together with Kiok Lay and
Manuel Kiok were guilty of fraud in contracting the obliga­tion and that there
was no sufficient security for Solidbank's claims other than the properties
sought to be attached.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">By </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">virtue of Solidbank's alternative
counterclaim, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Judge Romillo </span>in
said Civil Case No. 9609-P, issued an order of attachment on December 17, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1981.  The </span>following day December 18, 1981 a writ of preliminary
attachments was issued and upon Solidbank's posting of a good and sufficient <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bond the sheriff attached </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the properties </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

(d) present action is duplicatory of plaintiffs' application for damages upon

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On June 18, 1982,

reconsider the aforesaid decision having been denied, they now come before Us
through the instant petition praying that it be given due course and after
hearing judgment be rendered reversing and setting aside the assailed decision
of respondent court and that the complaint in Civil Case No. 9837-P be ordered
dismissed, or in the alternative, that this case be remanded to the court of
origin, Branch CXVI, Regional Trial Court Pasay City, for further proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The petition was given
due course in </span>the Resolution of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Second Division dated April 28, 1986 and the private res­pondents were required
to file their answer which they did </span>on June 23, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The grounds now relied
upon by petitioners are the same errors they assigned before the respondent
court namely ? </span>that the lower court should have dismissed this
case because of the pendency of Civil Case No. 9609-P or that the lower court
should have consolidated this case with the said Civil Case No. 9609-P; that
the lower court erred in declaring petitioners in default and that the damages
awarded are not warranted by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Anent the issue of
consolidation of this case with Civil Case No. 9609-P on the strength of the
doctrine laid down in the case or Rejuso vs. Estipona (72 SCRA 509) that
"any relief against such attachments could be disposed of only in that
case", suffice it to state that this doctrine applies in </span>the case
at bar.  The damages being claimed here
are <u>indirectly</u> for damages resulting from the attachment because if the
attach­ment had not been made, and the Order of Judge Romillo re­garding the
"status quo" at the time that partial attachment had already been
made had not been issued, there would not have arisen the <u>confusing</u> and <u>conflicting</u>
interpretations of said order.  Otherwise stated, the action of damages was essen­tially the result of
the attachment case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span>incident.  Con­solidation, being eminently proper,
should have been done.  Be it noted that
the action of private respondents here for damages because of the attachment
has already been terminated, the final judgments thereon being sufficiently
clear that the action for damages <u>would not lie</u> for the simple reason
that the attachment was proper.  (This
is evident in G.R. No. 72053 entitled Nation's Knitting Enterprises, Inc.; Kiok
Lay alias Ching Yu Dee and Spouse; Manuel Kiok and Spouse and Honorable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Manuel V. Romillo, Jr., as Judge of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">With respect to the
default judgment by the trial court, it should be emphasized that the trial

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the issue of damages,
We find the various awards by the respondent court completely unfair and
unwarranted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">While as pointed out by the
Court of Appeals actual damages may have been suffered by Knitting in view of
its failure to profit from certain business transactions it had </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">been accustomed to enter into, still this
loss if it exists, is directly attributable to private respondents' fault.  For instance, they could have immediately
asked the trial court for a clearer order allegedly <u>lifting</u> the writ of
preliminary attachment by saying so directly and expressly, and ordering the
delivery of the properties already attached to the private respondents or
resorted to appellate tribunals on the issue of said interpretations.  Then again, to mini­mize any foreseen or
unforeseen damage to it, Knitting could have tried to enter into <u>substitute</u>
contracts.  Upon the other hand let it
be understood that the legal counsel of </span>SOLIDBANK <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was correct in preventing the egress of
properties already attached since the order of Judge Romillo mandated clearly
the preservation of the "status quo".  What was the "status quo" at that time? - simply the
continued holding of properties already attached, </span>with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">no additional properties to be taken into cus­tody.  </span>At <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">any rate, if Knitting had any doubts about its meaning, it had the
duty, as the alleged prejudiced entity to ask for judicial clarification as
soon as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In the light of the
environmental circumstances attend­ant in this case, the assailed decision of
the respondent Court is hereby SET ASIDE, and a new one is hereby rendered
dismissing the case filed by private respondents against peti­tioners.  No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
