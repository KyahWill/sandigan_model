				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner, Mauro De la Cruz, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was </span>employed on <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="8">August
 16, 1977</st1:date> as card machine operator with a daily wage of P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">59 u</span>ntil he was dismissed from the
service on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date>
on account of the following incidents:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) On August <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">7, </span>1985,
at 2:20 o'clock in the afternoon, his attention was called by his department
manager regarding his manner of transporting the slivers in a can and dragging
the same from his place of work to the pre-intersecting area, instead of using
a cart as required by the company's regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He reasoned out that there was no available
cart; and</p>

<p class="BODY">(2) After being dressed down by the department manager, Cruz
proceeded to the company clinic on the pretext that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">he </span>had an upset stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
asked the company's lady physician, Dr. Rivera, to give him a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">sick </span>leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">But Dr. Rivera, wary of the
tricks of employees feigning illness to get off duty earlier than usual,
advised Cruz to wait in the clinic for further observation.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Affronted, Cruz shouted invectives at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">h</span>er saying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Sayang</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">pagka</span>-professional mo!"
(<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">p. </span>13, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)
and left the premises.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At <st1:time minute="15" hour="19">7:15 P.M.</st1:time>, Cruz
returned to the clinic and asked for a referral slip, but Dr. Rivera refused to
issue one to him, whereupon, he shouted at her:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"<span class="SpellE">Putang</span> Ina mo!" <span class="GramE">(p.
13, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As his acts constituted insubordination and misconduct,
punishable under Rules Nos. 40 and 45 <span class="GramE">with</span> dismissal,
he was informed of the violations and advised of his right to a hearing before
the Grievance Committee as provided in the collective bargaining agreement
between the union and the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Beginning <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1985</st1:date>,
he was no longer allowed to report for work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The grievance committee hearing was held on <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the committee had submitted its report, finding the charges to be
true, the management dismissed Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter found that petitioner's conduct toward the
company physician amounted to insubordination and conduct unbecoming of an
employee, which merited the penalty of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission
which dismissed his appeal for tardiness because the records showed that
petitioner's counsel received the copy of the Labor Arbiter's decision on
October 13, 1986, but he filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">an </span>appeal
on November 3, 1986 only, or 21 days after notice of the decision, hence,
"way beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> ten (10) calendar
days for filing an appeal to the Commission" (Annex B, p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his petition for <i>certiorari</i> in this Court, Cruz assails
the decision of the Labor Arbiter and the dismissal of his appeal by the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his comment, observed that the alleged
misconduct of the petitioner in the medical clinic was not fully proven because
Dr. Rivera did not testify.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
dismissing Cruz's appeal, the NLRC completely disregarded the explanation of
his counsel's clerk that she had misplaced the decision of the Labor Arbiter in
her hurry to leave for the province <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to</span>
be at the side of her ailing father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
recommended that the petitioner be reinstated with back wages, without loss of
seniority and other employment privileges and benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the NLRC in its own comment on the petition,
pointed out that before the petitioner was finally discharged, he was heard <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>the Grievance Committee and
"in the ensuing grievance report, the union did not disagree with the
charges nor questioned it, but protested only the penalty of dismissal imposed
on the petitioner" (p. 58, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) which it
considered too harsh.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner insists, however, that his dismissal was illegal
and without due process because it was <span class="GramE">effected</span> by the
company on <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1987</st1:date>,
twelve (12) days before the grievance committee was convened on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1987</st1:date> to hear the charges
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is therefore covered by our decision in <span class="SpellE">Wenphil</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vs. </span>NLRC,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">G.R. </span>No. 80587, <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1988</st1:date>, where we ruled that
the dismissal of an employee must be for just or authorized cause and after due
process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner was held to
account for its failure to extend to the employee his right to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">an </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">investigation </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">before causing his </span>dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court ordered the company to indemnify the employee <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent, Ramie
Textile, Inc., is ordered to pay indemnity to the petitioner in the amount of
P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> for having violated his right to due process
before it dismissed him for cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In </span>other respects, the decision of the
Labor Arbiter is affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
