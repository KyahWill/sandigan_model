Cesar M. <span class="SpellE">Fortich</span> of Agriculture and Natural Resources

inviting particular attention to the comment and recommendation of the Director
of Forestry in the preceding <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> in which

<blockquote>"The observations of respon­sible forest officials are most
revealing of their zeal to promote forest conservation and watershed protection
especially in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>
area. In convincing fashion, they have demonstrated that to declare the forest
area involved as a forest reserve rather than open it for timber exploitation
under license and regulation would do more harm than good to the public
interest. To convert the area into a forest reserve without an adequate forest
protection force, would make of it a 'Free Zone and Logging Paradise,' to the
ever 'Problem Loggers' of <span class="SpellE">Dinalupi­han</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> . . . an open target of timber smugglers, <span class="SpellE">kaingineros</span> and other forms <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the area, as planned, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to a reputable
and responsible licensee who shall conduct logging operations therein under the
selective logging method and who shall be obliged to employ a sufficient number
of forest guards to patrol and protect the forest conservation and watershed
protection.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">“Worthy of mention is the
fact that the Bureau of Fores­try had already conducted a public bidding to
determine </span>the most qualified bidder to whom the area advertised should
be awarded. Needless to stress, the decision of the Director of Forestry to
dispose of the area thusly, was arrived at after much thought and deliberation
and after having been convinced that to do so would not adverse­ly affect the
watershed in that sector. <span class="GramE">The result of the bid­ding only
have to be announced.</span> To be sure, some of the parti­cipating bidders
like Mr. <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pascual</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> went to much
expense in the hope of winning a virgin forest concession. To suddenly make a
turn about of this decision without strong justifiable grounds, would cause the
Bureau of Forestry and this Office no end of embarrassment.</blockquote>

prohibitory injunction (pp. 1-12, CFI rec.). Petitioner-appellant claims that

right to property without due process of law, and in effect, by impairing the
obligation of contracts" (p. 6, CFI rec.). Petitioner-appellant prayed for

demurrer in an action at law and, as a rule admits, for the purpose of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span>
vs. Ali <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>, et al. (16 SCRA 601, March 31,
1966), this Court, thru Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> V. Sanchez,
held that the trial court can properly dis­miss a complaint on a motion to
dismiss due to lack of cause of action even without a hearing, by taking into
consideration the discussion in said motion and the opposition thereto.
Pertinent portion of said decision is hereby quoted:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Respondents moved to dismiss. Ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
is lack of cause of action. The Court below granted the motion, dismissed the
petition. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The </span>motion to
reconsider failed. Offshoot is this appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1. The threshold questions are these: Was the dismissal order
issued 'without any hear­ing on the motion to dismiss'? Is it void?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WE go to the record. The motion to dismiss was filed on
February 1, 1961 and set for hearing on February 10 follow­ing. On February 8,
1961 peti­tioner’s counsel telegraphed the court, '(r<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">equest</span></span> postpone­ment motion dismissal till written
opposition filed.' He did not appear at the scheduled hearing. But on March 4,
1961, he followed up his wire, with his written opposition to the motion to
dismiss. <u>Adverting to the 5-page motion to dismiss and the 6</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">-page </span>opposition thereto, we find that
the arguments pro and con on the question of the board's, power to abolish
petitioner's position minutely discussed the problem and pro­fusely cited
authorities</u>. The May 15, 1961 8-page court order recited at length the said
arguments and concluded that petitioner made no case.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"One good reason for the statutory
requirement of hear­ing on a motion as to enable the suitors to adduce evidence
in support of their opposing claims.</span> But here the motion to dismiss is
grounded on lack of cause of action. Existence of a cause of action or lack of
it is determined by a reference to the facts averred in the challenged
pleading. The question raised in the motion is purely one of law. This legal
issue was fully discussed in said motion and the opposi­tion thereto. In this
posture, oral arguments on the motion are reduced to an unnecessary ceremony
and should be over­looked. And, correctly so, because the other intendment of
the law in requiring hear­ing on a motion, i.e., 'to avoid surprises upon the
opposite party and to give to the latter time to study and meet the arguments
of the motion,' has been suffi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ciently
met. And then, courts do not exalt form </span>over substance"
(underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, "even if the complaint stated a valid cause of
action, a motion to dismiss for insufficiency of cause of action will be
granted if documentary evidence admitted by stipulation disclosing facts
sufficient to defeat the claim enabled the court to go beyond disclosure in the
complaint" (LOCALS No. 1470, No. 1469, and No. 1512 of the International
Longshoremen's Association vs. <span class="SpellE">Sourther</span> Pacific Co.,
6 Fed. <span class="GramE">Rules Service, p. 107; U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
Fifth Circuit, Dec. 7, 1952; 131 F. 2d 605).</span> Thus, although the evidence
of the parties were presented on the question of granting or denying
petitioner-appellant's application for a writ of preliminary injunction, the
trial court correctly applied said evidence in the resolution of the motion to
dismiss. Moreover, in applying said evidence in the resolution of the motion to
dismiss, the trial court, in its order dismissing the petition, pointed out
that, "there is no reason to believe that the parties will change their
stand, arguments and evidence" (p. 478, CFI rec.). Petitioner-appellant
did not interpose any objection thereto, nor presented new arguments in his
motion for reconsideration (pp. 482­-484, CFI rec.). This omission means
conformity to said observation, and a waiver of his right to object, <span class="SpellE">estopping</span> him from raising this question for the first time
on appeal. "Issues not raised in the trial court cannot be raised for the
first time on appeal" (<span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Servidad</span>, Sept. 10, 1981, 107 SCRA 276).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner-appellant cannot invoke the rule that, when
the ground for asking dismissal is that the complaint states no cause of
action, its sufficiency must be determined only from the allegations in the
complaint. "The rules of procedure are not to be applied in a very rigid,
technical sense; rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of procedure are
used only to help secure substantial justice. If a technical and rigid
enforcement of the rules is made, their aim would be defeated. Where the rules
are merely secondary in importance are made to override the ends of justice;
the technical rules had been misapplied to the pre­judice of the substantial
right of a party, said rigid application cannot be countenanced" (Vol. 1,
Francisco, Civil Procedure, 2 ed., 1973, p. 157, citing cases).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ante-dated to December 19, 1963 on which date the authority of the Director of
Forestry was revoked. But, what is of greatest importance is the date of the
release or issuance, and not the date of the signing of the license. While
petitioner-appellant's timber license might have been signed on December 19,
1963 it was released only on January 6, 1964. Before its release, no right is
acquired by the licensee. As pointed out by the trial court, the Director of

annexes, plaintiff is not the owner, or entitled to the properties it claims to
have been levied upon and sold at public auction by the defend­ants and for
which it now seeks indemnity, the said complaint does not give plaintiff any
right of action against the defendants. In the same case, this Court </span>further
held that, in acting on a motion to dismiss, the court cannot separate the
complaint from its annexes where it clearly appears that the claim of the
plaintiff to be the owner of the properties in question is predicated on said

was held that the failure of the plaintiff to appeal from the adverse decision

court action in view of the theory that the Secretary of a depart­ment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>merely an alter-ego of the

has the power to review on appeal the orders or acts of the respondents <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the failure of the petitioner-appellant to take
that appeal is failure on his part to exhaust his administrative remedies.
Thus, this Court, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Calo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Fuertes</span> (5 SCRA 399, 400, June 29, 1962), held that:</p>

decisions of opinion of the former to the latter, and that, such being the
case, after he had appealed to the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources from the decision or opinion of the Director of Lands he had ex­hausted
all the administrative remedies, is untenable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The withdrawal of the appeal taken to the President of the
Philippines is tantamount to not appealing all thereto. Such withdrawal is
fatal, because the appeal to the President is the last step he should take in
an administrative case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, in revoking
the peti­tioner-appellant's timber license, were acting within the scope of
their authority. Petitioner-appellant contends that "this case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>not a suit against the State but an
application of a sound principle of law whereby administrative decisions or
actuations may be reviewed by the courts as a protection afforded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the citizens against oppression" (p.
122,CFI rec.). But, piercing the shard of his contention, We find that
petitioner-appellant's action is just an attempt to circumvent the rule
establishing State exemption from suits. He cannot use that principle </span>of
law to profit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">at the expense and
prejudice of the State and </span>its citizens. The promotion of public welfare
and the protection of the inhabitants near <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">the public forest are property, rights and interest of the State.
Accordingly, "the rule establishing State exemption from suits may not be
circumvented by directing the action against the officers of the State instead
of against the State itself. In such cases the State's immunity may be validly
invoked against the action as long as it can be shown that the suit really
affects the property, rights, or interests of the State and not merely those of
the officer nominally made party defendant" (SINCO, Phil. Political Law,

is valid, still respondents-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> can validly
revoke his timber license. As pointed out earlier, paragraph 27 of the rules
and regulations included in the ordinary timber license states: "<u>The
terms and conditions of this license are subject to change at the discretion of
the Director of Forestry, and that this license may be made to expire at an
earlier date, when public interests so require</u>" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

rights, neither is it property or property rights (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tin, 54 O.G. 7576). In the case of Pedro vs. Provincial

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">As provided in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> provision, timber licenses are subject to the
authority of the Director of Forestry. The utilization and disposition of
forest resources is directly under the control and supervision of the Director
of Forestry. However, "while Section 1831 of the Revised Administrative
Code provides that forest </span>products shall be cut, gathered and removed
from any forest only upon license from the Director of Forestry, it is no less
true that as a subordinate officer, the Director of Forestry is subject to the
control of the Department Head or the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources (Sec. 79<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">[c</span>],
Rev. Adm. Code), who, therefore, may impose reasonable regulations in the
exercise of the powers of the subordinate officer" (Director of Forestry
vs. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, 104 SCRA 309, May 5, 1981). The power
of control of the Department Head over bureaus and offices includes the power
to modify, reverse or set aside acts of subordinate officials (Province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> vs. Secretary of Public Works and
Communications, 30 SCRA 134, Oct. 31, 1969; Montano vs. <span class="SpellE">Silvosa</span>,

Secretary of Agricul<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ture </span>and
Natural Resources has the authority to revoke, on valid grounds, timber
licenses issued by the Direc­tor of Forestry. There being supporting evidence,
the revocation of petitioner-appellant's timber license was a wise exercise of
the power of the respondent-­<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources) and therefore, valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, "this Court had rigorously adhered to the principle of
conserving forest resources, as corollary to which the alleged right to them of
