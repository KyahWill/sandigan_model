guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of parricide:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The information alleges:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 26th day <span style="">of </span>August, 1980, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said
accused, with intent to kill, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and use personal violence upon the
person of ATTY. JOSE VIDUYA y TAVARES, her husband, and with whom she was
united in lawful wedlock, by then and there stabbing him several times with a
bladed weapon, thereby inflicting upon the said Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span>
y Tavares mortal stab wounds which were the direct cause of his death
immediately thereafter." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 4)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented the following evidence:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Domingo, a lessee on the ground floor of the
victim's house, testified that on <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="8">August
 26, 1980</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12 o'clock</st1:time>
<st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, she was awakened by moaning
sounds, followed by a thud, emanating from the second floor where the victim,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span>, lived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mrs. Domingo, who had been a lessee in the same house for twenty five
(25) years and had known her <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to suffer from a
heart ailment, presumed that the latter was having a heart attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She immediately ran towards the apartment of
the victim's family driver, <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span>, which was only four (4) meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She shouted, "<span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>, your sir might have a heart attack, you
better go upstairs." Awakened by her call, <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>
proceeded to the victim's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN,
February 24, 1981, pp. 154-157)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cambel</span> declared that he was the family driver and was
renting an apartment owned by the victim which is just a few meters from his
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="8">August
 26, 1980</st1:date>, he was aroused sleep by the shouts of <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
Domingo who was telling him to go upstairs as his "sir" might be
having an attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ran upstairs to the
house of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span> and was let in by Lydia <span class="SpellE">Firmanes</span>, a cousin of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon entering, <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span>
saw the victim clutching, with both hands, the handle of the refrigerator
located just outside the door leading to the victim's room, leaning thereon for
support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately standing behind the
victim was the accused, his wife, holding a knife with both hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span>
approached them, she stooped down saying "<span class="SpellE">Diosko</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Diosko</span>," trying to conceal the knife from
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cambel</span>
ran towards the victim, lending him support so that the latter would not
fall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the victim was heavy,
that even with <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span> supporting him, he nevertheless
fell down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still holding the victim, <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span> inquired from him what happened but the latter was
too weak to speak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not getting any
answer from the victim, <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span> asked the accused why
she stabbed her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Initially, the
accused did not answer, but upon being questioned for the second time, she
hesitantly muttered. "<span class="SpellE">Magnanakaw</span>, <span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>." Since other persons had by then arrived, <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span> requested assistance to bring the victim to the
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim was brought to <st1:place><st2:sn>St.</st2:sn>
 <st2:middlename>Jude</st2:middlename> <st2:sn>Hospital</st2:sn></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
but was pronounced dead on arrival.<span style="">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">Bagallon</span>, an investigator of the Crimes against
Persons Section of the Manila Police, Force, Western Police District declared
that he <span style="">conducted an on-the-spot ocular
inspection of the victim's house and found, in the bedroom of the victim and
the accused, a single bed with a white blanket in disorder, soaked </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">a pool of blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He extended the
search to the ground floor </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the house and recovered two pieces </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">bladed knives at the east yard </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the victim's
residence which was used as parking space for heavy trucks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the knives had a
bended blade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the east wall, he found
a rectangular hole which used to hold an air-conditioning unit, and a wall
clock and table clock beside the rectangular hole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise noticed some pieces of wood
placed under a parked heavy truck on the east yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused informed him that those pieces of
wood used to cover the rectangular hole.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he advised the accused and the victim's son, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span>, to go with him to the police headquarters for a
formal investigation. (TSN., Oct. 28, 1980, pp. 18-30)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

executed on the aforesaid date and time, she reiterated her narration contained
in her first "<span class="SpellE">salaysay</span>" executed earlier
that morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, however, she
declared that one of the malefactors was a certain <span class="SpellE">Edito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pateño</span>, their former employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit "L", p. 12, Folder of
Exhibits) On August 30, 1990 at 2:20 in the morning, Mrs. Virginia <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span> again executed a "<span class="SpellE">salaysay</span>"
(Exhibit "M", p. 13, Folder of Exhibits).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, at about 10:00 o'clock in the morning
of the same date, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Viduya</span> executed her <span style="">extrajudicial confession wherein she
categorically admitted authorship of the killing of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, she claimed that she merely acted in
self?defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibits
"N", p. 17, Folder of Exhibits)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded, not guilty to the charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the defense, during the trial is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused and her husband were asleep in separate beds when she
was awakened by her husband's moans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
saw two men, one pointing a knife at her temple and the other stabbing her
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She identified <span class="SpellE">Edito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pateño</span> as the man who poked
a knife at her temple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pateño</span> was about to stab her so she parried the knife and
tried to wrest it away from him and in the process, the <span style="">blade </span>became bent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
ran after them shouting "<span class="SpellE">Magnanakaw</span>, <span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>" but they had already escaped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit "L", <span style="">p. 11, Folder of Exhibits) She recognized <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span>, their family
driver, as the man who stabbed her husband (TSN., March 17, 1981, p. 352).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cambel</span> even
threatened and slapped and nearly choked her to death at the first night of the
wake because he could not force her to sleep (TSN., June 10, 1981, pp.
427-428).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was misled and deceived by
Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Bagallon</span> into signing her extrajudicial
confession (TSN., June 10, 1981, p. 431) since he told her that she will not be
detained if she signs the document.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN., March 27, 1981, p. 372)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the lower court rendered its decision adjudging
the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt <span style="">of </span>the crime of parricide.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">The trial judge, in holding that the extrajudicial confession is
admissible, reasoned out that there is no prohibition for Assistant Fiscal
Domingo A. Mendoza to act as counsel for the accused as it is his primordial <span style="">duty not only to prosecute a case but also to
protect the rights of an accused and to see that no violence, force, coercion
or intimidation be used to </span><span style="">secure
</span><span style="">from a person under custodial
investigation his statement. (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 13)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 12(1) of Article
III of the 1987 Constitution favors the accused and is fully applicable </span>to
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also elementary that a
Fiscal or Prosecutor cannot be a lawyer for the accused at the same time.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his testimony, Assistant Fiscal Mendoza stated that his main
functions as Assistant Fiscal in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
are to prosecute cases and to<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>render
<span style="">duties as an inquest fiscal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a><span style=""> Whether or
not the subsequent trial of a confessant's case will be assigned to him as
prosecutor is immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot
pretend to act as defense counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An assistant fiscal, or a fiscal for that matter, cannot exercise
the function of defense counsel even during custodial investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow such a happenstance would render
illusory the protection given to<span style=""> </span>the
accused during custodial investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">What the </span>Constitution requires in
Article III Section 12 (1) is the presence of competent and independent
counsel, one<span style=""> who will effectively
undertake his clients defense without any intervening conflict </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the answer of the accused ("<span class="SpellE">Nandiyan</span>

<span class="SpellE">kailangan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">abogado</span>") is a palpable indication that she did not
fully understand her in-custody rights, hence it cannot be said that she
knowingly and intelligently waived those rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule espoused in <u>People</u> <u><span style="">v</span></u><span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Nicandro</u></span>, 141 SCRA 289
[1986]), bears repeating:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Like other constitutional rights, the right against
self-incrimination, including the right of a person under investigation to
remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right, may be
waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be valid, however, a waiver
of the right must not only be voluntary it must be made knowingly and
intelligently, which presupposes an <span style="">awareness
or understanding of what is being waived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It stands to reason that where the right has not been adequately
explained and there are serious doubts as to whether the person interrogated
knew and understood his relevant constitutional rights when he answered the
questions, it is idle to talk of waiver of rights."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This ruling has been reinforced and made clearer by the new
provision of the <span style="">Bill </span>of Rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">The extrajudicial confession having no probative value on the
grounds that it was executed without the presence of counsel and there having
been no intelligent waiver of the right to remain <span style="">sile</span>nt, this Court no <span style="">longer
deems it necessary to inquire into the alleged deceit employed by Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Bagallon</span> in extracting the above-mentioned confession from
the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The remaining issue left for determination is whether or not the
prosecution evidence, absent the extrajudicial confession, is sufficient to
sustain the lower court's conviction of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">A rule firmly entrenched <span style="">in
</span>our criminal justice system is that the prosecution must rely on the
strength of its evidence and not on the weakness of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Ramirez, 116 SCRA 48 [1982];
People v. Co, 163 SCRA 453 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>the case before us, the defense of
the accused is weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>trying <span style="">to </span>exculpate <span style="">herself, the
appellant tried to shift culpability to another person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attempt is not convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial court ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The claim of accused that it was <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cambel</span> who stabbed her husband for reasons that he
had been indifferent, never cared to bring the victim to the hospital, that he
was drunkard, a Casanova and failed to repair the headlamp of their car on
time-such motive is too incredible to believe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That he slapped and choked her when every body were (sic) asleep at the
first night of the wake at the <span class="SpellE">Funeraria</span> Paz and she
did not shout but merely cried are beyond the comprehension of human
instinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence to be believed must
not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible
in itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> v. BLT Bus Co., Inc., 34 SCRA 618
[1970]) It is a common knowledge and a recognized custom within us that no
relative or friend will sleep on the very first night of a wake - more so when
the case of death is a shocking one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Human perception can be warped by the impact of events and the testimony
colored by the unconscious workings of the mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No better test has yet been found to measure
the value of a witness' testimony than its conformity to the knowledge and common
experience of mankind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever is
repugnant to these belong to the miraculous and could not be of judicial
cognizance (People v. <span class="SpellE">Baquiran</span>, 20 SCRA 451
[1967])." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 14-15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But though the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> defense is
weak, the prosecution's evidence is not strong enough to adduce proof beyond
reasonable doubt that the accused is the <span style="">guilty
party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A thorough review of the prosecution's evidence discloses that
the only proof linking the accused to the killing of her husband is the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cambel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cambel</span> testified
that he saw the accused behind the <span style="">victim,
</span>holding a knife with both hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is <span style="">not </span>shown how
twelve stab wounds, most of them serious, could have been inflicted by a woman
under the circumstances of his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two knives were involved in the stabbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other than <span class="SpellE">Melanio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cambel's</span> testimony, there is no other evidence, direct or
circumstantial, pointing to the accused as the author of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General capitalizes on the inconsistencies in the
three affidavits which the accused executed prior to the taking of her
extrajudicial confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is of the
persuasion that her issuance of three statements, the truth of which she
affirmed in open court but the contents of which differ from each other, is
another circumstantial evidence of her culpability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, is of the view that the
conflicting affidavits executed by the accused merely weaken her defense and
cannot be considered as circumstantial evidence for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the trial court's complete reliance on only one of <span style="">three </span>(3) extrajudicial statements and
its total rejection of the two other statements without any independent
evidence or proof for such action, is not <span style="">explained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the paucity of the State's evidence, we are not
satisfied that the constitutional presumption of innocence accorded to the
accused-appellant has been <span style="">overthrown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>constitutional presumption of
innocence can be overcome only by proof beyond reasonable doubt, <span style="">which is the degree of proof that, after
investigation of the whole record, produces moral certainly in an unprejudiced
mind of the appellant's culpability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Dramayo</span>, 42 SCRA 59 [1971]) The
prosecution failed to produce such proof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court, therefore, has no other recourse but to acquit the accused-
appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is high time that our law enforcement agencies learn to live
with the new requirements of the Bill of Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A former Senator and distinguished
libertarian <span style="">w</span>as reportedly asked
about academic qualifications of <span style="">policemen
and he answered, "they have only one degree ­-- the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">third
degree." This perception, justified </span><span style="">or not, </span><span style="">is the </span><span style="">reason for </span><span style="">the present Bill of </span><span style="">Rights </span><span style="">provision </span><span style="">on
extrajudicial confessions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should
become a thing of the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Better
investigation procedures and more sophisticated techniques, not to mention
industry and persistence, must replace the former persuading and coercing of,
or total dependence on extrajudicial confessions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
