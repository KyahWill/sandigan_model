<p class="BODY">During the trial, the prosecution was not able to present any
eyewitness to the killings and the robbery.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, the judgment of conviction was based mainly on the sworn statements
of <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span>
which were not unqualified confessions of guilt but declarations against penal
interest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> in his confession said that
he stabbed <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> while the latter was asleep
because a man pointed a gun at him and ordered him to kill <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> was

(later identified as <span class="SpellE">Parcon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sabulao</span>

bound him with rope and rattan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
ordered <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> to help them in carrying <span class="SpellE">Eusebio's</span> body, which was weighted with a stone, and they

stabbing <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> and then his body was thrown into

throwing away the heads of the two victims at some distance from the

 <st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype></st1:place> where he fingered <span class="SpellE">Parcon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sabulao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Langgao</span> as the three persons who took part in the killing
of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> and his two sons and in the robbery com­mitted
in <span class="SpellE">Eusebio's</span> family residence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Julito</span> accompanied the police to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio's</span> residence where he pointed the place where the
heads of Columbus and <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> were disposed of.</p>

<p class="BODY">These circumstances show that the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> that they
had nothing to do with the robbery with homicide are arrantly false.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the appellants could lie so glaringly on those matters, then
it is not surprising that they would also lie that they were tortured by the
police, that they did not execute any confessions before the mayor and chief of
police and that they were not arraigned and did not plead guilty "<span class="SpellE">dahil</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">kami</span>
ay <span class="SpellE">inutusan</span> <span class="SpellE">lamang</span>''.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their confessions are replete with many details which they alone
could supply and which the mayor and chief of police would not be able to
concoct out of thin air.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, some probative value must be accorded to the ad­missions
in their confessions as to their participation in the robbery with
homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, their counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> did not believe their alibi and their
pretension that they had no complicity in the commis­sion of the crimes
charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court said that it could not believe that the mayor,
chief of police and municipal judge of El <span class="SpellE">Nido</span> had
diabolically framed up the appellants, there being no motive that would impel
them to commit such "an abominable act".</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that the confessions of <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> were given voluntarily because they
contained details which had nothing to do with the robbery with homicide and
exculpatory statements such as that <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> was
ordered to kill <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> and his sons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court cited the rule that an
exculpatory state- <span class="SpellE">ment</span> in a confession is an
indication of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> because it is not usually
found in an extorted confession (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
L-3240, April 21, 1952, 91 Phil. 910, unpublished).</p>

<p class="BODY">It also cited the holding that there may be instances, occasions
and circumstances which make it justifiably imperative for the trial judge to
believe or accept only a part of the confession and reject the rest (People vs.
<span class="SpellE">Solaña</span>, 116 Phil. 383, 390).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that with respect to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> the crime committed is murder (not robbery
with homicide), that only <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Orayan</span> should be held responsible for that crime and that <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> did not commit robbery against <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no direct evidence whatsoever as to any robbery committed against
<span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> when he was killed in his farmhouse where he
had temporarily lodged for <span style="">the
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution did not prove
what personal effects of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>, which were in his
farmhouse or on his person while asleep, were taken by the appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The things belonging to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>, which
were found in the pos­session of <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> (money,
for example) could have been taken from his residence at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Dipnay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
<span class="SpellE">Julito's</span> confession, the robbery took place in <span class="SpellE">Eusebio's</span> residence (Nos. 47 and 48, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
Y).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, while conceding "that there really
seems to be no evidence to show that appellant <span class="SpellE">Julito</span>"
directly participated in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>,
nevertheless, contends that he is liable as a co-principal because "he
conspired with" his brother <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The eight circumstances­ enumerated by the
Solicitor General in his brief, from which the conspiracy may allegedly be
inferred, do not exclude a reasonable doubt that <span class="SpellE">Julito</span>
had no complicity in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Former Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Barot</span>, appellants' counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><u><span style="">,</span></u><span style=""> </span>who conscientiously studied the record, including their hardly
legible confessions to the police (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. X, Y and W),
agreed with the trial court that <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> killed <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> and that his claim that he acted under duress was a
fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence that <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> participated in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery is aggravating because <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
was killed while asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nocturnity</span> is absorbed by treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dwelling is not aggra­vating because the
farmhouse was the dwelling of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> should be sentenced to
<u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> </span>for
the killing of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span> candidly admits that <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span>
committed robbery with double homicide with respect to the incident in <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rosete's</span></span><span style="">
residence in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Dipnay</span> or </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">San Fernando</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, he contends that treachery was not aggravating because there is
no conclusive evidence that the victims were asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the facts that the robbery with homicide (by
decapitation) was committed at night, that the victims were wearing T-shirts
and briefs, that their bodies were lying on mats, one on a <span class="SpellE"><u>papag</u></span>
or bamboo bed and the other on the floor, that there were no signs of a struggle
or resistance and that the killings were easily consummated (as indicated in
appellants' statements to the police) are conclusive indications that the
victims were asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, treachery is
aggravating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dwelling is also
aggravating.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
contends that <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> should not be regarded as a
co-principal in the robbery with homicide committed in <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rosete's</span> residence but only as an accessory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General argues that he is a
co-principal.</p>

<p class="BODY">While there is no proof that <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> took
part in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> in <u>his farmhouse</u>
in the evening of <st1:date month="4" day="4" year="1972">April 4, 1972</st1:date>,
there is no question that <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> was with his brother
<span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> and with <span class="SpellE">Parcon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Langgao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sabulao</span> when the
robbery with homicide was perpetrated <span style="">in
<span class="SpellE"><u>Eusebio's</u></span><u> residence</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His exact role in the perpetration of that
spe­cial complex crime is not shown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He was riding in a motorized <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, <u>Josie
Christ</u>, with his brother and the three men when they went to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio's</span> residence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He assisted his brother in taking possession of the objects taken from
the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was with his
co-accused when the heads of the two victims were placed in the kerosene can
and thrown into a place at some distance from the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left the scene of the crime with his
co-accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">He may not be a co-principal but certainly he was not a mere
accessory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should be held liable at
least as an <u>accomplice</u> in robbery with double homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was <span class="GramE">not a mere spectator
nor</span> just a recipient of the loot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was apparently a lookout or guard.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Julito's</span> <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>
testimony is that he was born on <st1:date month="8" day="28" year="1957">August
 28, 1957</st1:date> (17 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date month="8" day="21" year="1973">Aug. 21, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, he was fourteen years and eight months old when the crimes were
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His statement to the police
shows that he acted with discernment.</p>

<p class="BODY">As he is now more than twenty-four years old, he is no longer
entitled to a suspended sentence whether under article 80 of the Re­vised Penal
Code or under article 192 of the Child and Youth Welfare Code, Presidential
Decree No. 603, as amended by Presidential Decrees Nos. 1179 and 1210.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he is entitled to a two-degree
reduction of his penalty under article 68(1) of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> <span class="SpellE">Superiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Orayan</span> is convicted of murder for having killed <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and ordered to pay an indemnity of twelve
