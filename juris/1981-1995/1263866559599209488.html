<p class="BODY">Under Circular No. 40 dated <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1974</st1:date> of the Acting Postmaster General,
motorcycle allowance for letter carriers using motorcycles in the delivery of
mails was increased to P60.00 a month effective <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Authority was given to postmasters to allow the letter carriers
concerned to collect their allowance from postal collections at the increased
rate to be charged as budgetary expenses (Exhibit "J").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Implementing the aforesaid Circular No. 40,
the Chief of Finance and Management Division, Bureau of Posts, in a memorandum
to the Acting Postal Regional Director, Region I, San Fernando, La Union,
directed that payment of motorcycle allowance of letter carriers be allowed
from "the postal collections of the postmaster concerned where the letter
carrier is assigned effective the date when the letter carrier actually used
the motorcycle in the delivery of mails." This memorandum was circularized
by the Officer-in-Charge of Postal Region I per Circular No. 3 dated <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there specifically stated that
“payment of motorcycle allowance of letter carriers shall be made by the
postmaster under whose office said employees x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> are assigned which must be certified in the voucher or
payroll as the case may be.” (Exhibit "J-1").</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the memorandum of the Regional Director of Postal
Region I dated <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1976</st1:date>
(Exhibit "G"), Regional Auditing Examiner Rodolfo Ramirez y Rodriguez
conducted an audit examination of the accounts of the postmasters in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>La Union</st1:placename></st1:place>, among them the
postmaster of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Beach</st1:placetype></st1:place> and <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span>
Post Offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of his
examination, Mr. Ramirez discovered spurious vouchers (Exhibits "E",

covering payments of motorcycle gasoline allowance of letter carriers not
assigned to that particular post office, and similar spurious vouchers
(Exhibits "F", "F-1" to “F?6”) in the <span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span> Beach Post Office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The postmasters assigned in <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span> who made the payments of the vouchers were accused <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> J. Ramos and German J. <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examiner Ramirez submitted
a memorandum dated September 14, 1976 to the Regional Director on his
examination of the <span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span> Beach Post Office and
other post offices in La Union (Exhibit "H"), and a separate
memorandum dated October 14, 1976 on his examination of the <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span>
Post Office (Exhibit "I-1").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In both memoranda, the discovery of spurious claim vouchers representing
payments of motorcycle allowance of letter carriers not assigned to either <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Beach</st1:placetype></st1:place>

Office, Bureau of Posts, in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
which forthwith disallowed the forged claim vouchers paid by Postmasters <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Ramos and German <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>
and recalled the credit advances previously issued to them relating to the said
irregular vouchers (Exhibits "K" and "K-1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examiner Ramirez also sent a demand letter to
accused Postmaster <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Ramos for the restitution
of the shortage found in his accounts amounting to P13,320.00 (Exhibit “L”).</p>

<p class="BODY">At<span style=""> </span>the instance of the
prosecution, accused Ernesto Benavidez, an audit examiner of the Bureau of
Posts in Region I, was discharged from the Information in all the cases and
utilized as one of the People's witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 918, out of the twenty-five (25)
letter-carriers named in the information, only twenty (20) testified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all disowned their supposed signatures

allowance for the periods and received the amounts reflected therein or
authorized anybody to file any claim for them, or rendered service in the <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span>, La Union Post Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal witness for the prosecution against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Ramos, the sole appellant in this case, is the
discharged accused turned state witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ernesto Benavidez y Blanco, who testified as <span class="GramE">follows</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From 1970 to 1980, he was an employee of the
Bureau of Posts where he started as Accounting Clerk I, then as Senior Clerk
and later as Audit Examiner from <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="6">June
 16, 1976</st1:date> to July, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he was assigned in the Regional Office of the Bureau of Posts at <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La Union from 1973 to 1980, his immediate
superior was the Chief of the Administrative Division, Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Tugade</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied
having been under the direct supervision of accused <span class="SpellE">Constante</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
met for the first time <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>
in 1973 and, thereafter, they had been meeting in the Regional Office almost
everyday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was sometime in May, 1975
that <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> and a certain <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span>
Gabriel, a buyer in the Regional Office, invited him to a round of drinks at
the Symphony Restaurant, San Fernando, La Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of his need for money, he agreed to
deliver fake motorcycle allowance vouchers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said vouchers were to be prepared by <span class="SpellE">Blandino</span>
Gabriel and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Asporias</span> and to be delivered by
him to either the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Beach</st1:placetype></st1:place> or <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span>
Post Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceeds of the
vouchers would be divided in the following manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>10% to Gabriel; 30% to the Postmaster; 50% to
<span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>; and 10% to him (Benavidez).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1975</st1:date>, he met Gabriel at <span class="SpellE">Galinato's</span>
office and with <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> proceeded to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Beach</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he was given fake vouchers by <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> in the
name of Crispin <span class="SpellE">Fangon</span>, signed by <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, postal money order checks payable
to <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> were issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then introduced as <span class="SpellE">Galinato's</span>
trusted man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another delivery of fake
vouchers <span class="GramE">were</span> made by <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>
on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1975</st1:date> to <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> which was followed on <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Benavidez was instructed later by <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> to
deliver gasoline allowance vouchers to either <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Beach</st1:placetype></st1:place>
or <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span> Post Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voucher was in the name of Santiago
Asuncion, signed by <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> who paid the amount to
Benavidez in postal money order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> by Benavidez upon the order of <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>
when he returned to the regional office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two more notes with similar instructions were given to him on different
occasions (Exhibits "N" and "N-1").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vouchers given to him with the notes were
Exhibits "E", "E-1" to "E-3", "E-5" to
"E-14", "E-16" to "E-19", "E-22" and
"E-23", and Exhibits "F", "F-1" to "F-6",
which were all signed by Gabriel, <span class="SpellE">Asporias</span> and <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> above the printed phrase "Signature of
Creditor." He brought the vouchers (Exhibits "E",
"E-1" to "E?3", "E-5" to "E-14",
"E-16" to "E-19", "E-22" and "E-23") to
<span class="SpellE">Bauang</span> Postmaster <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span>
Ramos who signed them and gave him the corresponding amounts of the vouchers,
some in cash and some in postal money orders, less Postmaster Ramos’ 30% share
in each voucher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the
proceeds, amounting to 70% of the face value of the vouchers <span class="GramE">was</span>
turned over by him (Benavidez) to <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> who gave
him (Benavidez) his 10% share and 10% to Gabriel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the other vouchers (Exhibits
"F", "F-1" to "F-6"), he delivered them to
Postmaster <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> at the <span class="SpellE">Nalinac</span>
Beach Post Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>
signed the vouchers and paid him their value, some in plain cash and the others
in postal money orders (Exhibits "P", "P-1" to
"P-8") less the 30% share of <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> in
each voucher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of the postal money
orders (Exhibits "P", "P-1" to "P-3",
"P-7" and "P-8") were issued in his name (Benavidez) as
payee, while Exhibits "P-4" to "P-6" in <span class="SpellE">Galinato's</span>
name as the payee, all of these postal money orders were signed by <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> as "Issuing Employee." All the persons
whose names appear as "Remitter" were fictitious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On his return to <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, he delivered the cash and the postal money
orders to <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> who signed those issued in his (<span class="SpellE">Galinato's</span>) name (Exhibits "P-4" to
"P-6").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was instructed by <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> to cash all the postal money order checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> then gave
him his 10% share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benavidez further
claimed that sometime in May, 1986, accused <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>
and Ramos went to the Regional Office looking for <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>
but failed to meet him because <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> had been
designated Acting Postmaster of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Learning this, Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>
each prepared a letter (Exhibits "O" and "O-1") and asked
him to deliver to <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> which he did.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense presented petitioner <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Ramos to testify in his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version is as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in November, 1975, Benavidez
presented to him a voucher of Benito <span class="SpellE">Mangawang</span> for
P960.00 and a note from Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Ochavez</span>, the Special
Disbursing Officer of Region I, urging him to pay the voucher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He paid it to Benavidez who told him that <span class="SpellE">Mangawang</span> was a letter carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He met Benavidez again in December,
1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, Benavidez presented to
him some more vouchers for payment, followed by still other vouchers the last
of which was either in June or July, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These vouchers were Exhibits “E” to "E-23." They were already
signed by the creditors when presented to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the payees were not presented, were unknown to him and he knew
them to be not assigned in his office, he paid the vouchers to Benavidez in
good faith on the strength of the letter of <span class="SpellE">Ochavez</span>
and two (2) letters from <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> (one of them is Exhibit "9-Ramos")
handed to him by Benavidez which instructed him to pay the vouchers and enter
them in his record of collections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
letter of <span class="SpellE">Ochavez</span> and the other letter of <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> were taken by District Postal Inspector <span class="SpellE">Natalio</span> Robles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further bases of his action were the credit advices (Exhibits “8-A” to
“8-H-Ramos”) he received from the Central Office of the Bureau of Posts which
did not disallow any of the previous paid vouchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 3 or 4 vouchers were paid in money
orders which he entered in his record of collections while the rest were paid
in cash duly entered in his record of payments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not deduct any amount or receive any share from these vouchers he
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From November, 1975 to June or
July, 1976, his accounts were periodically audited but not one of those
vouchers was disallowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But after the
August, 1976 audit of his accounts by Auditor Rodolfo Ramirez, the said
vouchers were disallowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then sent
telegrams to all the creditors/payees in the vouchers asking them to return the
payments to him (Exhibits "4" to “4-N-Ramos”).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He disowned Exhibit "O”, the letter
dated <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1976</st1:date>, ascribed
to him by Benavidez as not his letter, pointing out that the signature therein
is not his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made several signatures
before the Court to show that none matched the signature in aforesaid letter
(TSN, February 5, 1981, pp. 43-76).</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF
ERNESTO BENAVIDEZ, AN ACCUSED TURNED STATE WITNESS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN DECLARING THE EXISTENCE OF A CONSPIRACY
BETWEEN HEREIN PETITIONER AND THE OTHER ACCUSED.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN NOT HAVING RULED THAT PETITIONER HAS
ACTED IN GOOD FAITH AND WITHOUT ANY CRIMINAL INTENT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">IV<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO DECLARE THAT PETITIONER MERELY
OBEYED A LAWFUL ORDER ISSUED BY A SUPERIOR OFFICER.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that a perusal of the information filed
against the accused would readily show that Ernesto Benavidez played a very
major and substantial role in the afore­said cases, among which are the
following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) it was Ernesto Benavidez
himself who personally caused the preparations of the alleged spurious vouchers
and (b) it was Ernesto Benavidez himself who, in all instances personally collected
and received from the postmasters <span class="GramE">concerned</span> all of the
amounts represented by the alleged spurious vouchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, despite the objection of his
co-accused that Benavidez was the <span class="GramE">most guilty</span> and
would, therefore, not qualify as state witness under Rule 119, Section 9(d),
the latter was discharged as such, on the ground that the prosecution cannot
prove the offenses charged without him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The discharge of an accused in order that he may be utilized as a
state witness is expressly left to the sound discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, section 9 of Rule 119, as amended,
provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 9.</span> Discharge of accused to be
state witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When two or more
persons are jointly charged with the commission of any offense, upon motion of
the prosecution before resting its case, the court may direct one or more of
the accused to be discharged with their consent so that they may be witnesses
for the state when after requiring the prosecution to present evidence and the
sworn state­ment of each proposed state witness at a hearing in support of the
discharge, the court is satisfied that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) There is absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused
whose discharge is requested;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) There is no other direct evidence available for the proper
prosecution of the offense committed, except the testimony of said accused;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) The testimony of said accused can be substantially corroborated
in its material points;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(d) Said accused does not appear to be the <span class="GramE">most
guilty</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(e) Said accused has not at any time been convicted of any offense
involving moral turpitude.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Evidence adduced in support of the discharge shall automatically
form part of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the court
denies the motion for discharge of the accused as state witness, his sworn
statement shall be inadmissible in evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court has the exclusive
responsibility to see that the conditions prescribed by the rule exist (People
v. Ibanez, etc., et al., 92 Phil. 936 [1953]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For the law seeks to regulate the manner of enforcement of the regulations
in the sound discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The grant of discretion in cases of this kind under this provision was
not a grant of arbitrary discretion to the trial courts, but such is to be
exercised with due regard to the correct administration of justice (People v.
De <span class="SpellE">Atras</span>, 28 SCRA 389 [1969]).</p>

<p class="BODY">It has, however, been ruled that while it is the duty of the
trial judge to exercise a sound discretion in conformity with the provisions of
the statute, if he fails in the performance of his duty, or errs in the
exercise of his discretion in this regard, such error does not relieve from
criminal responsibility the guilty participants who are not discharged to be
used as witnesses, any more than a similar error in the weighing of the
evidence submitted at the trial which results in the acquittal of one of
several co-accused, who was in truth and in fact a guilty participant in the
crime charged against them, will afford a claim of exemption from criminal
liability by the other accused who were properly convicted (United States v. <span class="SpellE">Abanzado</span>, 37 Phil. 666 [1918]).</p>

<p class="BODY">While the discharge of Benavidez as state witness under the <span class="GramE">circumstances,</span> was not in accordance with Section 9(d), Rule
119, nonetheless, in line with settled rulings and precedents, his testimony
has to be admitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in accepting the
testimony of a co-accused-turned-state witness, this Court is not unmindful of
the principle that in such a case, the testimony of the witness should be
received with great caution and should be carefully scrutinized (People v. <span class="SpellE">Gongora</span>, 8 SCRA 473 [1963]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner called attention to the fact that the oral testimony
of Benavidez is so replete with inconsistencies and with allegations that are
contrary to human nature and experience that they should not have been given
credence by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it was
pointed out that Benavidez executed three sworn statements dated December 2,
1976; September 8, 1978; and October 28, 1980, the latter reiterated almost <u>verbatim</u>
in the oral testimony given to the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>; all of
which are contradictory with one another; and admitted by the witness himself
to be false except the last one given to satisfy the investigator at the
particular time who promised to give him immunity from suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it was noted that Benavidez
produced several typewritten notes purportedly signed by accused <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>, who ordered him to deliver the vouchers to Ramos
and <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>, a practice considered absurd and
improbable for if indeed there had been a prior arrangement between <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> Benavidez and postmasters Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>, there would not have been a need for the
presentation of said typewritten notes.</p>

<p class="BODY">There appears to be no dispute that had the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>
relied solely or the testimony of Benavidez to establish the guilt of
appellant, it might have failed to prove the latter's guilt beyond reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it will be noted that the testimony of Benavidez was <span class="SpellE">corrorobated</span> by the admissions of appellant <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> Ramos himself, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that he paid the questioned vouchers when
presented to him by Benavidez although they were already signed by the supposed
creditors who were not presented to him; (b) that aforesaid creditors were
unknown to him and more importantly; (c) that he knew the supposed payees were
not assigned to his office, obviously in violation of Circular No. 40, series of
1974 of the Bureau of Posts and Implementing Regional Circular No. 3 of Postal
Region I providing that payment of such allowance "shall be made by the
Postmaster under whose office said employees x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> are assigned which must be certified in the voucher or
payroll...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The certification shall
include x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the kind,
make and serial number of the motorcycle." <span class="GramE">(Exhibit
"J-1", <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 93-94).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos' only excuse is that he paid the
vouchers in good faith and on the strength of the letter of <span class="SpellE">Ochavez</span>
and two (2) letters from <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> handed to him by Benavidez, which instructed him
to pay the vouchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
provision of Regional Circular No. 3 is explicit and unmistakable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His alleged lack of knowledge thereof is <span class="GramE">inexcusable,</span> if not improbable considering that the said
circular is directly connected with his duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can he avail of the defense that none of his previous
paid vouchers were disallowed in audit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from the fact that the questioned vouchers were spurious and
cannot be legalized by the Central Office, the records show that the credit
advices were based on the reports of payment submitted by Ramos without the
corresponding vouchers attached, so that the Central Office would not be in a
position to determine whether or not the payees are letter carriers assigned to
the <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span> Post Office of Ramos (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 97-98).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances obtaining in the case at bar,
corroboration of the testimony of Benavidez by the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>
evidence tending to connect and/or implicate Ramos with the offense, is
evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More than that, as found by the
<span class="SpellE">Sandigan­bayan</span>, they lend credence to the testimony
of Benavidez as to the existence of conspiracy among the accused (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 95).</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It has been ruled that the findings of the trial court on the
existence of conspiracy should not be disturbed where such findings are not
only logical but also because they are based on evidence appearing in the
record (People v. <span class="SpellE">Arhis</span>, 144 SCRA 691 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, jurisprudence supports the contention that it is not
necessary that conspiracy be proved by direct evidence as the same can be
inferred from acts of the accused (People v. Pineda, 157 SCRA 73 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, conspiracy exists where the evidence on record shows that
the questioned documents were prepared and processed by the government
officials involved in connection with the performance of their official
functions and duties and the anomalous transactions could not have been made
possible without the connivance of the persons concerned (<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 160 SCRA 683 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">As testified by Benavidez, conspiracy was first established at
their first meeting at the Symphony Restaurant where <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>
convinced Benavidez to join them in the criminal scheme, their subsequent
meetings, the preparation of the fake vouchers and their presentation to the
two postmasters <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> and Ramos, herein petitioner,
culminating in the payment of said fake vouchers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The involvement of Ramos in this <span class="GramE">conspiracy,</span>
is shown by his payment of the questioned vouchers to payees unknown to him and
not assigned to his post office, in violation of Circular No. 40, series of
1974 and Regional Circular No. 3 of Postal Region I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vouchers were presented by Benavidez and
honored by Ramos despite their obvious spurious nature, lending credence to the
testimony of Benavidez that they were <span class="GramE">effected</span> in
pursuance of a previous arrangement among the accused:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> and Ramos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further confirming aforesaid agreement was the letter of Ramos
(Exhibit "O") to <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> urging <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span> to send him more vouchers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos disowned the signature on the letter
and wrote for comparison three (3) specimens, none of which were similar to the
questioned signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, however, found that the questioned signature
is similar to Ramos' signatures on the vouchers he admitted he had signed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the testimony of Benavidez is duly corroborated by
physical evidence such as the vouchers, the instructing notes, the postal money
orders, as well as the incriminating letters, all of which persuasively show
the criminal conspiracy among the four postal officials.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In general, evil intent must unite with an unlawful act for there
to be a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ignorance or <span class="GramE">mistake as to particular facts, honest and real, will</span> as a
general rule, exempt the doer from criminal responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception, however, is neglect in the
discharge of duty or indifference to consequences, which is equivalent to
criminal intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The element of
malicious intent is supplied by the element of negligence and imprudence
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacana</span>, 47 Phil. 55 [1924]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the negligence if not
criminal intent of appellant in paying the vouchers in question, is beyond
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can petitioner be declared as having merely obeyed a
lawful order issued by a superior officer; there being a clear violation of
Circular No. 40, series of 1974 of the Bureau of Posts, while <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>, on whose order Ramos supposedly paid the
questioned vouchers, was not even his immediate supervisor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing considerations, no cogent reason could
be found to reverse the findings and conclusion of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the
