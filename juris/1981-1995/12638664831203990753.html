 29, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, the CTA
upheld the Commissioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It held that
the expenses incurred by the petitioner for handling its funds or income

"carrying on any trade or business," hence, not deductible as
business or administrative expenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

income derived from the operations of the hospital and the nursing <span class="GramE">school are</span> exempt from income tax while the rest of
petitioner's income are subject thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Its taxable or non?operating income consists of rentals, interests
and dividends received from its properties and investments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the computation of its taxable income for
the years 1952 to 1955, petitioner allowed <u>all</u> its taxable income to
share in the allocation of administrative expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent disallowed, however, the <u>interests</u>
and <u>dividends</u> from sharing in the allocation of administrative expenses
on the ground that the expenses incurred in the administration or management of
petitioner's investments are not allowable business expense inasmuch as they
were not incurred in â€˜carrying on any trade or business' within the
contemplation of Section 30 (a) (1) of the Revenue Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>assessed deficiency income taxes

<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>petitioner
failed to establish by competent proof that its receipt of interests and
dividends constituted the carrying on of a 'trade or business' so as to warrant
the deductibility of the expense incurred in their realization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No evidence whatsoever was presented by
petitioner to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">show </span><u>how</u> it
handled its investment, the <u>manner</u> it bought, sold and reinvested its
securities, how it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

statistical services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there
any showing of the <u>extent</u> of its activities in stocks or bonds, and
participation, if any, <span class="GramE">direct</span> or indirect, in the
management of the corporations where it made investments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In effect, there is total absence of any
indication of a business-like management or operation of its interests and
dividends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Roebling</span>
vs. Comm. of Int. Rev., 37 BTA 82).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, petitioner merely relied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">on </span>the assumption that '<u>if</u> it is to
handle its investment portfolio profitably, it has either to engage the
services of an investment banker or administer it from within but the latter
necessarily involves studying the securities market, the tax aspects of the
investments, hiring accountants, collectors, clerical help, etc. without
showing that it was actually performing these varied activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner could have easily required any of
its responsible officials to testify on this regard but it failed to do
so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances and
coupled with the fact that the interests and dividends here in question are
merely incidental income to petitioner's main activity, which is the operation
of its hospital and nursing schools, the conclusion becomes inevitable that
petitioner's activities never go beyond that of a passive investor, which under
existing jurisprudence do not come within the purview of carrying on any 'trade
or business.'" <span class="GramE">(pp. 47-48, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Court of Tax Appeals
found that the interests and dividends received by the petitioner "were
merely incidental income to petitioner's main activity, which is the operation

petitioner's activities never went <span class="GramE">beyond</span> that of a

That factual finding is binding on this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And, as the principle </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">allocating
</span>expenses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is grounded on the
premise that the taxable income was derived from carrying on a trade or
business, as distinguished from mere receipt of interests and dividends from
one's investments, the Court of Tax Appeals correctly ruled that said income
should not </span>share in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
allocation of administrative expenses (p. 49, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Incorporation, was established for purposes "which are benevolent,
charitable and religious, and not for financial gain" (p. 12, Petitioner's
Brief).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not carrying on a trade or
</span>business for the word "business" in its ordinary and common
use means "human efforts which have for their end living or reward; it is
not commonly used as descriptive of charitable, religious, educational or
social agencies" or "any particular occupation or employment
habitually engaged in especially for livelihood or gain" or
"activities where profit is the purpose or livelihood is the motive."
