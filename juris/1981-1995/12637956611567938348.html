fifty nine (1,059) square meters, more or less.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

registered under Act 496 since 1916, with the <span class="SpellE">Kapantawan</span> River as the natural boundary to the West but 
subsequently by accretion thru the accumulation of alluvial deposits west of Lot 
1068-A the parcel of land described in par. 2 of this complaint was 
formed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The late Juan Estevez and his heirs after his demise took 
immediate possession thereafter and improved the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 
residential house was constructed thereon with cement footings, which was 
however destroyed by the Typhoon TRIX in October 1952.<span>&nbsp; </span>Up to the 
present the cement footings are still there and a toilet still exists therein 
used by the lessee of the plaintiff on Lot 1068-A;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> presently pretends certain rights over 
a portion of the second parcel of land and is threatening to destroy the toilet 
of the plaintiff therein constructed.<span>&nbsp; </span>This defendant further 
intends to construct a building of permanent nature over the old site of the 
building of the <span class="SpellE">plaintiff</span> <span>estate destroyed by 
the typhoon <span class="SpellE">trix</span>;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>"5.<span>&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiff is informed and so believes 
that the defendant Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> acquired by

1068-A and on a part of the second parcel of land.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>To this

Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> with uncalled for audacity sought to 
compel the plaintiff to remove the said

<blockquote>"6.<span>&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiff is likewise informed and so 
believes that defendant Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> applied with 
the defendant Director of Lands for the purchase <span>of </span>lease of the 
second parcel of land under the mistaken belief that said land forms part of the 
public domain, disposable under the public land law.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That the second parcel of land is the private property of the 
plaintiff estate and the heirs by right of accretion.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The 
defendant Director of Lands or anyone acting in his behalf may not dispose of 
the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>No action so far has been had on the application of the 
defendant Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>;<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"7<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>That</span> prior to the filing 
of this action, defendants tried to make a survey of the second parcel of land 
but plaintiff suspended and protested any such survey.<span>&nbsp; </span>Defendant 
Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> under false representations with the 
Office of the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, recently secured a building permit to construct a 
building on the second parcel of land;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>"8<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>That</span> by reason of the 
hostile acts of the defendant Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> and the 
apparent desire of said defendant to ripen whatever pretensions he has over the 
second parcel of land into a valid right by applying for its use and occupation 
with the defendant Director of Lands a cloud has been created over the said 
parcel of land, which need to be removed at once.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the event 
that after the <span>service </span>of process, the defendant Director of Lands 
decide to claim the second parcel of land as part of the public domain, then 
plaintiff maintains that the said property is a private land by right of 
accretion;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>"9.<span>&nbsp; </span>That even admitting <span class="SpellE"><em>arguendo</em></span> only that the said strip of land described 
as parcel (a) of this complaint forms part of the <span>public </span>land 
disposable under the public land (which contention is hardly allowable) yet by 
reason of priority of possession, improvements, and claim, the plaintiff is 
entitled to its adjudi<span>cation as against </span><span>the defendant 
Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>"10.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the acts of defendant have been done with 
the utmost bad faith.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has full knowledge of the rights of the 
plaintiff over the property now disputed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff has been 
forced to go to Court in order to protect the rights of the plaintiff estate 
resulting in the expense of P1,000.00 for attorney's fees before this Court 
alone, plus<span>&nbsp; </span>additional expenses on 
appeal;<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"11.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That by the unjust acts of usurpation committed 
and threatened to be done by the defendant <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, 
plaintiff is entitled to actual and moral damages in the sum of P2,000.00; 
partly for use of land by <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>;" (Record on Appeal,

<p class="2Q">The defendant, The Director of Lands, through the Solicitor General,

in adjudicating the disputed parcel of public lands exist only in the 
imagination of plaintiff who is not even certain that a public land application

ground for the issuance of injunction, much less an <em>ex-parte</em> 
injunction.</p>
<p class="3Q">"By way of affirmative defense <span>to this </span>Honorable Court 
alleges:</p>
<p class="3Q">"That the petition does not show that the defendant is doing,

done some acts <span>in </span>violation of plaintiff's rights, tending to 
render the judgment ineffective and therefore fall short of the legal requisites 
to entitle the petitioner to the injunction issued." (<em>Ibid</em>., pp. 
22-23)</p>
<p class="2Q">After trial, the lower court dismissed the complaint with costs 
against the plaintiff.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 31-41)</p>
<p class="2Q">On <st1:date year="1961" day="14" month="3">March 14,

which can be summarized into two:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<ol><li><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span></span>The Court of Appeals grievously 
erred in declaring that there was accretion and consequently in not declaring 
the same as public land subject to the disposition of the Director of Lands; 
and<br><br></li><li>The Court of Appeals grievously erred in not granting petitioner's petition 
for relief from judgment."</li></ol>
<p class="BODY"><span>After a diligent study and examination of the records of the 
</span><span>case, </span><span class="GramE"><span>We</span></span><span> find no 
reason to reverse the findings of facts or conclusions arrived at by the lower 
courts.<span>&nbsp; </span>In ruling that there was indeed accretion, the appellate 
court declares clearly that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"The records show indubitably the existence of a river west of the 
titled property of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (Annexes "A" and 
"B").<span>&nbsp; </span>Annex "A" to the motion for new trial is the plan of 
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1068 showing that the property of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has as its natural boundary to the west the 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kapantawan</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Annex "B" to the 
Motion for New Trial is the cadastral plan of <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> 
Port confirming the existence of said natural boundary to the west as <span class="SpellE">Kapantawan</span> River.<span>&nbsp; </span>This fact which was 
established during the previous trial of the case on the testimony of Dr. 
Estevez was made more indubitable during the new trial by testimonies of 
witnesses, Jorge A. <span class="SpellE">Logroño</span>, Soledad <span class="SpellE">Maristela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> O. 
Pineda.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lagroño</span> was a government 
official who plotted and relocated on the ground the development plan <span>of 
</span><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maristela</span> 
and Pineda are adjoining property owners who testified categorically to the 
existence of the natural boundary to the west of <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> property as the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kapantawan</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>." (pp. 44-45, 
record)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The lower courts reached such conclusion not whimsically but 
after painstakingly considering the attending circumstances and the entire 
evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>Worth mentioning also is the fact that the same trial 
judge who made the factual finding that <span class="SpellE">Kapantawan</span> 
River did not exist in the area, granted a motion for new trial to receive newly 
discovered evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court, in its amended decision, 
emphasized:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"At the new trial, the plaintiff presented oral and documentary 
evidence tending to <span class="GramE">established</span> that boundary of Lot 
No. 109 to the West was actually a river.<span>&nbsp; </span>After careful 
consideration of said evidence, the Court is convinced that formerly the real 
boundary of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 109 to the West was a river."In view of 
the foregoing finding, it is now clear that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 109 was 
formed by the <span>alluvial </span><span>accumulation of deposit through the 
action of the current of the river.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore <span>Article 457 
</span>of the Civil Code of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
applies.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said article reads:<o:p></o:p></span> 
<blockquote>
<p class="2Q">"ART. 457<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>To</span> the owners of 
land adjoining the banks of rivers <span>belong the </span>accretion which 
<span>they gradually receive </span>from the effects of the current of the 
waters."</p></blockquote>"As between the plaintiff and the 
<span>de</span>fendant, Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, the former 
has the <span>right </span>to Lot No. 109."</blockquote>
<blockquote>(pp. 83-84, Record on Appeal)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">It is argued by petitioner that ocular inspections must be given 
probative value.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ocular inspection was indeed made by the trial 
judge to establish the condition of the area a generation before the ocular 
inspection was conducted.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said ocular inspection cannot be given 
too much probative value because there might be physical changes through the 
passage of the years the cause of which cannot easily be determined by said 
ocular inspection.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the evidence submitted by petitioners 
themselves show that the source of the water in the area in question had been 
cut off from the sea even before the Japanese invasion of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The evidence for private respondent shows that subsequent to the year 
1916, gradual accumulation of the deposits covered by the current of the 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kapantawan</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> had already taken place.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Also witness for the petitioner Mr. Juan <span class="SpellE">Firaza</span>, Acting Provincial Land Officer of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> testified as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"Q -<span> </span>You have no personal knowledge as to whether 
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 109 in this case existed because of the drying up of 
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tibu</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> or because it was filled up by 
the adjacent owner or because it was due to the accumulation of sediment, you do 
not know that?</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A -<span>&nbsp; </span>No, 
<span>sir."</span></span><span> </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, May 16, 1960, p. 
78). </span>(p. 137, record)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the other hand, there is enough evidence that the land in 
question was formed by accretion; thus it belongs to the riparian owner, 
pursuant to Art. <span class="GramE">457 of the Civil Code of the 
</span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span>Philippines</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the Director 
of Lands has no jurisdiction over it and any conveyance made by him of any 
private land is null and void.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We </span><span>now </span><span>come to the second 
assignment of error.<span>&nbsp; </span>This <span>was touched </span>upon 
extensively in the ruling of the <span>trial court </span></span><span>and in 
</span><span>the ruling </span><span>of the respondent Appellate <span>Court to 
the effect </span>that several notices (re the submission of the case for 
decision) had been duly sent by registered </span><span>mail </span><span>to the 
attorneys involved.<span>&nbsp; </span>We fully agree with <span>said 
finding.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Note further that on </span><span>appeal, the respondent 
Court of <span>Appeals, ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<blockquote>"The alleged excusable negligence for <span>failure </span>to 
<span>claim </span>the mail addressed to <span>coun</span><span>sel </span>for 
the defendant because of change of <span>address </span>without notification of 
such change <span>to the </span>parties and to the Court is not a valid ground 
or an excuse for failure to appear for the hearing set forth in said motion, 
con<span>sidering </span>the certification of the Acting Mail Operation Chief, 
Registry Division that no <span>less </span>than three (3) notices were sent to 
the addressee therein failed to claim the mail.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" </span>(Decision of 
respondent Court of Appeals, <span>Annex </span>"C" of Petition of Diogenes 
<span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, p. 11) (p. 140, records)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>In support of their contention, petitioners cite the 
<span>principles </span><span class="GramE">laid</span> </span>down in <span>the 
case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Vecino</em></span><em> v. Court of 
Appeals</em><span>, </span>L-38612, </span><st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="3"><span>March 29, 1977</span></st1:date><span> (p. 140, Record).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Such contention was aptly refuted by respondents in their memorandum, to 
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"The factual setting of the <span class="SpellE">Vecino</span> case is 
entirely different from the facts obtaining in this case.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said 
case does <span>not involve a situation which obtains in </span>this case, where 
a <span>counsel </span>transferred from his office address of record without 
notifying the court and parties thereof, as he is required to do under the Rules 
of Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is using his very negligence and admitted violation 
of the Rules of Court as a shield to avoid consequences unfavorable to his 
case.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, there was no fraud, accident, mistake or 
excusable negligence, upon which a petition for relief from judgment can only be 
granted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"More importantly, there is no showing that petitioner 
<span>Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon's</span> rights with </span>respect to 
the determination of the merits of the case were harmed or adversely 
affected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Extensive evidence had been presented by petitioners to 
support their respective theories as to the cause how <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 
109 was formed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, petitioner Diogenes <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> did not state in his motion for relief from judgment 
what evidence he will present which, if admitted, will probably change the 
decision of the trial court, as he is required to do in the Rules of 
Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>His petition, therefore, is <em>pro forma</em> and the only 
purpose to be achieved by the allowance thereof is the delay of the disposition 
of the case."</blockquote>
<blockquote>(pp. 140-141, records).</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>With respect to the denial of the petition for relief filed 
by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> insofar as the decision of the 
trial court was initially held to be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, this issue was no longer pressed by the parties 
inasmuch as said petitioner was subsequently allowed to appeal from the decision 
itself.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See petitioner's brief, p. 
44).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Besides, there was no question about the timeliness of 
the appeal from said decision by petitioner Director of 
Lands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
