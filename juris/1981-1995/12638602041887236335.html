OF DENIAL" repudiating the donation of the <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>
property to Josefina because it was allegedly procured through fraud and
trickery.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that in
April 1983, she still could sign her name, and that she had no intention of
donating the property to Josefina who had not done her any favor and in fact
abandoned her during her illness (pp. 100 and 113, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
G.R. No. 79917).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same occasion, November 19, 1983, she <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1983</st1:date>,
the "REVOCATION OF DONATION" was registered on the back of Carmen's

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1983</st1:date>,
Josefina filed a complaint in the Regional Trial Court of Manila against
Carmen's estate and the Register of Deeds of Manila to annul the Deed of
Revocation of Donation (Civil Case No. 83-21629).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that the deed of revocation, made
only ten (10) days before Carmen's death, was false and fictitious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked the court to appoint an
administrator <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ad</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>litem</u></span>

G.R. No. 79917). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Upon filing the
complaint, she caused to be recorded a Notice of <span class="SpellE">Lis</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendens</span> on the title of the property (p. 98, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 79917).</p>

<p class="BODY">Without appointing a special administrator for Carmen's estate,
the court caused summons to be served on the estate. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The summons was received by <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Muyot</span> (Annex C, p. 60, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 79917).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1984</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Cebreros</span> registered the sale of the <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> property to them and obtained TCT No. 158305 in
their names (p. 90, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 79917).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1984</st1:date>,
Josefina's complaint was amended to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> <span class="SpellE">Muyot</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Cebrero</span> spouses as
additional defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition to
the original causes of action, the amended complaint sought the nullification
of <span class="SpellE">Muyot's</span> General Power of Attorney and the sale of
the <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> property to the <span class="SpellE">Cebrero</span>
spouses (Annex G, p. 68, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 79917).</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Laviña</span> filed an Answer (later an
"Amended Answer with Compulsory Counterclaim") for the Estate and <span class="SpellE">Muyot</span> (Annexes H and I, pp. 91 and 105, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
G.R. No. 79917).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, Josefina filed a motion to disqualify him on the
ground <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>his authority as
counsel for Carmen was extinguished upon her death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also assailed the service of summons to
the decedent's Estate through <span class="SpellE">Muyot</span> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reiterated her motion for the appointment of
a special administrator for the Estate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Laviña</span> opposed the motions (Annexes K

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1986</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Vicencio</span> denied Josefina's motion to disqualify
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Laviña</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also denied the motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
appoint a special administrator for the Estate "since the deceased left a
Will naming an <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> (executrix), and the
latter has accepted the trust." He sustained his court's jurisdiction over
the Estate based on the service of summons upon <span class="SpellE">Muyot</span>
(Annex P, p. 179, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 79917).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1987</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebrero</span> filed a motion to cancel the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> on the <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span> property (Annex B, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
G.R. No. 78295).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before Judge <span class="SpellE">Vicencio</span> could act on it, Josefina filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
on February 6, 1987 in the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 11260) assailing
Judge <span class="SpellE">Vicencio's</span> order of September 23, 1986 (Annex
P, p. 179, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 79919) and praying for a
writ of preliminary injunction to stop him from further proceeding in Civil
Case No. 83-21629 (Annex V, p. 236, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No.
79917).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals issued a
restraining order on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1987</st1:date>,
ordering the lower court to "desist from proceeding with Civil Case No.
83-21629 <u>until further orders</u>." <span class="GramE">(Annex W, p. 260,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 79917.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="3">March 16,
 1987</st1:date>, in spite of the restraining order, Judge <span class="SpellE">Vicencio</span>
issued an order <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span> (Annex
N, p. 170, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 78295) because he believed
the Appellate Court's restraining order of <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1987</st1:date> expired on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1987</st1:date>, i.e., after 20 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">On motions of Josefina (Annex O, p. 153, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
G.R. No. 79917 and Annex P, p. 178, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No.
78295), the Court of Appeals, on May 4, 1987, set aside Judge <span class="SpellE">Vicencio's</span> order and required him, as well as his branch
clerk of court and Attorney <span class="SpellE">Laviña</span> to show cause why
they should not be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">punished for
contempt of court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
held that the 20-day limitation on the life of a restraining order did not apply
to it but only to lower court "judges," for Section 5 of BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 224 provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Interim Rules which states that the same shall apply to ‘all inferior courts

refers to all courts except the Supreme Court, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>

224 was incorporated in the Interim Rules, with the significant change of the
word 'judge' to 'court,' so as to make it clear and unequivocal that the

may not appear "as counsel for the estate of Carmen P. Gabriel because his
authority as her counsel was extinguished upon Carmen's death” (Art. 1919,
