				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Originally for automatic review before us prior to the abolition
of the death penalty under the 1987 Constitution, the present consolidated
cases for murder are now on appeal after the accused-appellants manifested
their intention to exercise their right to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two separate informations charging the accused-appellants with
the crime of murder were filed before the former Court of First Instance of
Misamis Oriental, 15th Judicial District, Branch V, Cagayan de Oro City for the
killing of the spouses Gaudencio Jamero and Dionisia Tadios Jamero.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 333-M(78), the information reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned, accuses Pedro Galendez, Eulalio Galendez,
Narciso Acabo, Felix Tadios, Carlos Tadios, Fabian Sajot and Emelio Llemit, of
the crime of Murder, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'That on or about the 4th day of February, 1978 at more or
less 11:00 o'clock in the evening, at Kibungol, Hindangon, Gingoog City,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping
one another, with deliberate intent to kill and with evident premeditation,
treachery and by taking advantage of superior strength, by employing means or
method to insure its execution and without risk to themselves, armed with
deadly weapons, to wit:  two
sharp-pointed bolos, one sharp-pointed knife, a scythe, a stone and a coffee
stick (sic), with which the accused were conveniently provided, did then and
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack, stab, wound and hit
one DIONISIA TADIOS JAMERO, thereby wounding the victim on her face, nose,
eyes, jaw, frontal bones and other parts of her body, which injuries caused her
instantaneous death thereafter.  The
following aggravating circumstances were present in the commission of the
crime, namely:  (1) that it was
committed in the dwelling of the offended party; (2) treachery; (3) cruelty;
(4) evident premeditation; (5) superior strength; (6) nighttime; and (7) by a
band.'"</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to and in violation of Article 248 in relation to Article
14, paragraphs 3, 6, 13, 15 and 16, all of the Revised Penal Code."
(Rollo, p. 3)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 334-M(78), the same accused were charged
with murder for the death of Gaudencio Jamero allegedly committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 4th day of February, 1978 at more or
less 11:00 o'clock in the evening, at Kibungol, Hindangon, Gingoog City,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping

there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack, stab, wound and hit
one Gaudencio Jamero, thereby wounding the victim on his face, left and right
foot, stomach, and other parts of his body, which injuries caused his
instantaneous death thereafter.  The
following aggravating circumstances were present in the commission of the
crime, namely:  (1) that it was
committed in the dwelling of the offended party; (2) treachery; (3) cruelty;
(4) evident premeditation; (5) superior strength; (6) nighttime; and (7) by a
band." (Rollo, p. 8)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment, all the above-named accused entered pleas of
not guilty.  Joint trial proceedings
ensued upon the agreement of the prosecution and the defense considering that
the crimes as charged were committed on the same occasion and required the same
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, three of the accused, namely, Emelio Llemit, Fabian
Sajot and Carlos Tadios were acquitted on the ground of insufficiency of
evidence while the accused-appellants were found guilty beyond reasonable doubt
of double murder.  The dispositive
portion of the trial court's decision rendered on December 20, <span style="">1979 </span>states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused
Eulalio Galendez, Pedro Galendez, Narciso Acabo and Felix Tadios guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of murder in both Criminal Cases Nos. 333-M and
334-M and, therefore, sentences each of them to suffer the supreme penalty of
Death in each case, to indemnify, jointly and severally, the Heirs of the
offended parties in both cases in the amount of Twelve Thousand Pesos
(P12,000.00) and to pay the costs.  The
accused Carlos Tadios, Fabian Sajot and Emelio Llemit are acquitted of the
charges in both cases for insufficiency of evidence, and the warden or whoever
is in custody of these three accused is/are directed to discharge them from
confinement immediately unless they are facing other charges.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (CFI Decision, p. 65, Rollo, p. 73)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are presented by the Solicitor General in
his brief as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On February 4, 1978, about 11:00 P.M., appellants together
with Carlos Tadios, Fabian Sajot and Emilio (should be Emelio) Llemit went to
the house of spouses Gaudencio <span style="">and
Dionisia Jamero located at Kibungol, Hindangon, Gingoog City.  Their purpose, according to appellants, was
to have the aching shoulder of appellant Pedro Galendez treated.  Gaudencio Jamero tapped it the day before,
and Pedro Galendez felt that his right arm would fall from its socket (p. 7,
tsn, Oct. </span>15, 1979; p. 8, tsn, Oct. 22, 1979; p. 4, tsn, Oct. 25,
1979).  Gaudencio Jamero was claimed to
be known as a sorcerer whose notoriety spread throughout the locality (Exh.
"M"; p. 8, tsn, Oct. 15, 1979; p. 10, tsn, Oct. 26, 1979).  But Emilio Llemit stated that the purpose of
appellants for going to the Jamero house was to avenge the death of Eutiquio
Baino, a relative of Pedro and Eulalio Galendez, who died a victim (sic) of
Jamero's sorcery (pp. 10-12, tsn, Oct. 26, 1979).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pedro Galendez was armed with a long, sharp-pointed bolo (Exh.
"J"), Eulalio Galendez with a scythe (Exh. "O"), and
Narciso <span style="">Acabo was bringing a torch (pp.
6, 8, tsn, April 16, 1979).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">When Pedro Galendez,
Eulalio Galendez and Narciso Acabo climbed the stairs in the Jamero house,
Fabian Sajot, Carlos Tadios and Emilio Llemit stayed behind at a distance of
about 30 meters (pp. 11-12, tsn, Oct. 26, 1979).  The dogs of the Jameros were then barking (pp. 5, 51, tsn, April
16, 1979).  Felix Tadios stood watch at
the foot of the stairs (Exh. "Q").  Narciso Acabo called out for Gaudencio Jamero and gave his name when
asked to identify.  As soon as Gaudencio
opened the door, Pedro Galendez stabbed him with a long bolo on his stomach;
Gaudencio staggered towards the wall (Exh. "J"; pp. 5-7, 12, 51, tsn,
April 16, 1979).  Lourdes, 19-year old
daughter of Gaudencio Jamero, tried to help her father; but Eulalio Galendez,
who was already inside with Narciso Acabo, held her hands</span> (pp. 9, 54,
id.).  Flavio, 15 year old brother <span style="">of Lourdes, tried to help his sister but
Eulalio boxed him on the left eyebrow.  Flavio fell, but he instantly stood up and jumped out of the window,
fleeing to the forest.  (pp. 10-11,
id).  Lourdes also jumped out of the
window after she was freed from Eulalio (pp. 54-55, id).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">The three who were outside
the house, namely, Emilio Llemit, Carlos Tadios and Fabian Sajot heard Gaudencio
Jamero shout.  Realizing that something
was wrong, they ran away (pp.<sub> </sub>13-14, tsn, Oct. 26, 1979).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Meantime, Dionisia Jamero,
wife of Gaudencio, was awakened by the commotion and, sensing what was
happening, fled toward the </span>stairs.  She was however met downstairs by Felix Tadios who struck her head and
face with the use of a stick cut from a coffee tree (Exh. "Q", cf.
pp. 54-55, tsn, April 16, 1979).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">On February 5, 1978,
appellants together with Llemit, Sajot and Carlos Tadios surrendered themselves
to Sgt. Wilfredo Mueco of the PC Detachment stationed at Balason, Gingoog City
(pp. 31-33, tsn, Dec. 11, 1978).  Pedro
Galendez also surrendered a bolo, Exhibit "J" (pp. 34-35, id).  Then Sgt. Mueco and some companions went to
the house of the Jameros and found the dead body of Gaudencio (pp. 37-38,
id).  They searched for Gaudencio's
wife, but they could not find her (p. 38, id).  The next morning, February 6, another group found the dead body of
Dionisia Jamero under a second growth forest, 450 meters from the Jamero house
(p. 12, tsn, Dec. 12, 1978).  She was
promptly buried following her husband (p. 39, tsn, Dec. 11, 1978).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">In the afternoon of
February 6, 1978, Dr. Vicente Jadol, City Health Officer of Gingoog City,
exhumed the dead bodies of Gaudencio and Dionisia Jamero and conducted a
post-mortem examination (pp. 4-6, tsn, Dec. 11, 1978).  Gaudencio Jamero died of internal hemorrhage
due to multiple hacking and stab wounds on different parts of his body.  Dr. Jadol's findings are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>All seven surrenderees were taken to the City Hall where the police
investigated them.  As a result, they
all signed and swore to their statements namely:  Exhibit "M", for Pedro Galendez, Exhibit "L",
for Eulalio Galendez, Exhibit "P", for Narciso Acabo, Exhibit "Q",
for Felix Tadios, Exhibit "R":, for Carlos Tadios, Exhibit
"S", for Fabian Sajot and Exhibit "T", for Emilio Llemit
(pp. 6-12, rec. of Crim. Case No. 334-M)".  (Brief for the Appellee, pp. 3-10; See Rollo, p. 159)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense version as contained in the accused-appellants' brief
is:</p>

<blockquote>"On February 4, 1978, at about 11:00 P.M., appellant together
with Carlos Tadios, Fabian Sajot and Emilio (should be Emelio) Llemit went to
the house of the spouses Gaudencio and Dionisia Jamero.  According to the testimony of Emilio Llemit,
appellant Pedro Galendez was alleged to have forced the <span style="">3 </span>to accompany them as he along with his companions were (sic)
going to kill Gaudencio Jamero, a person who in their locality was thought to
possess voodoo power (TSN, Emilio Llemit's testimony, October 26, 1979, p. 10)
and who moreover was thought by appellant Pedro Galendez to have caused the
death of Eutiquio Baino, a relative of appellant Pedro Galendez (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 12) The 3 being threatened with death by appellant Galendez were forced to
accompany appellants (<u>Ibid</u>).  This alleged motive of appellants in going to see Gaudencio Jamero was
however disputed by appellants.  The
latter's motive for going to the Jamero house was to have the aching shoulder
of appellant Pedro Galendez treated; it seemed that Gaudencio Jamero had tapped
it the day before, appellant Pedro Galendez felt that it was "going to
fall off." (TSN, Testimony of Pedro Galendez, Oct. 15, 1979, p. 7; TSN,
Testimony of Eulalio Galendez, Oct. 22, 1979, p. 7; TSN, Testimony of Narciso
Acabo, Oct. 25, 1979, p. 4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The three stayed thirty or more meters away from the Jamero house
(TSN, Testimony of Emilio Llemit, Oct. 26, 1979, p. 13) but appellants went
inside the house (Ibid, p. 14).  Llemit
testified that he heard Gaudencio Jamero shout, and realizing that something
was wrong, ran to the forest together with Sajot and Carlos Tadios (<u>Ibid</u>.).<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>As to what happened inside the Jamero house, appellant Pedro
Galendez testified that Gaudencio Jamero opened the door and upon learning that
appellant Pedro Galendez wanted his shoulder treated, said ‘whenever people get
sick, they place the blame on me (Jamero).’ (TSN, Testimony of Pedro Galendez,
Oct. 15, 1979, p. 11).  Jamero then got
very angry, retreated and reached for his bolo.  (<u>Ibid</u>. p. 12) Appellant Galendez then pulled out his bolo
and stabbed him (<u>Ibid.</u>) several times (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 14).  By this time, appellants Narciso Acabo and
Eulalio Galendez, as well as Dionisia and the Jamero children ran away (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 12).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Flavio Jamero, Gaudencio Jamero's son, however alleged, that his
father upon hearing appellant Acabo calling him, opened the door and was then
stabbed by appellant Pedro Galendez with a large bolo (TSN, Testimony of Flavio
Jamero, April 16, 1979, pp. 5-6).  His
father staggered to the wall; his sister Lourdes tried to help her father, but
her hands were held by appellant Eulalio Galendez (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 9).  Flavio tried to come to the aid of his
sister, but he alleged that appellant Eulalio Galendez hit him on the left side
of his lower eyebrow (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 10).  Flavio Jamero then jumped out of the window and saw that two persons who
(sic) he could not identify were beating his mother Dionisia (<u>Ibid</u>.) who
by this time had also fled from the house.  Flavio returned to the house the following morning and saw that his
father was already dead (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 14).  He then went to report the death to the Philippine Constabulary together
with his cousin, Juan Todle (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 15) Also on February 5, 1978,
Flavio told a neighbor Jose Namoc that Dionisia Jamero had died.  Namoc, together with some 22 of his
companions searched for the body of Dionisia and found it on February 6, 1979,
450 meters away from the Jamero house (TSN, Testimony of Jose Namoc, Dec. 12,
1978, p. 12) with a wound between her two eyes above the bridge of the nose (<u>Ibid</u>.).<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Sgt. Wilfredo Mueco assigned to the Philippine Constabulary
Detachment at Bal­ason, Gingoog City, testified that appellants together with
Llemit, Tadios and Sajot surrendered themselves to him on February 5, 1978
(TSN, Testimony of Wilfredo Mueco, Dec. 11, 1978, p. 31), for the reason that
they ‘killed somebody’ whom they named as Gaudencio Jamero (<u>Ibid</u>., p.
32).  Appellant Pedro Galendez also was
said to have surrendered a bolo (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 35).  After which, Sgt. Mueco together with some
companions went to the house of Gaudencio Jamero and found his body (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 38).</blockquote>

<blockquote>All seven surrenderees were taken to the City Hall, where they were
subjected to questioning and gave extra-judicial confessions.  It is in respect of these extra­-judicial
confessions upon which the trial court based its decision finding appellants
guilty of the separate crimes of murder of Gaudencio and Dionisia Jamero, a
reliance which will be shown to be prejudicial error.  (Appellant's Brief, pp. 2-4; See Rollo, p. 147)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lone assignment of error made by the accused-appellants that:</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONSIDERING
THE EXTRAJUDICIAL CONFESSIONS OF THE APPELLANTS AS ADMISSIBLE AGAINST THEM AND
BASING ITS DECISION OF FINDING THEM GUILTY THEREON" (Appellants' Brief, p.
1)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">rests on their allegation that the said
extrajudicial confessions were involuntarily given inasmuch as force,
intimidation and violence attended the taking of the sworn statements from the
accused-appellants in connection with their respective participation in the
crimes of murder under consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a painstaking review of the records of this case, taking
into account the letters forwarded to us by the accused-appellants begging for
our mercy, we are not persuaded to tilt the scales of justice in their favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far as the death of the victim Gaudencio Jamero is concerned,
the prosecution presented the children of the deceased spouses who positively
identified the accused-appellants as the assailants of their father.  On direct examination, Flavio Jamero
categorically declared as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no flaws in the aforequoted testimonies that would
discredit the witnesses considering the relationship that existed between them
and the deceased since we have consistently held that the mere relationship of
a witness to a party does not impair his credibility.  (see Ebajan v. Court of Appeals, 170 SCRA 178 [1989] citing
People v. Demetrio, 124 SCRA 914 [1983]) Moreover, in the case at bar, Dr. Vicente
Jadol, the medical officer who conducted the post-mortem examinations on the
bodies of the deceased Jamero spouses provided collaborating testimony,
thereby, rendering the testimonies of the eyewitnesses, Flavio and Lourdes,
credible.  Dr. Jadol described the
severity of the wounds sustained by the Jamero spouses and the instrument that
could have caused the said wounds (TSN, December 11, 1978, pp. 4-20)</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, we reiterate our ruling in the case of <u>People</u> <u>v</u>.
<u>Gil</u> <u>Uy</u>, <u>et.</u> <u>al</u>. (G.R. No. 84275, February 14, 1992)
that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x x </span>mere
relationship to the victim need not automatically tarnish the testimony of the

the victim does not render their clear and positive testimony less worthy of
full faith and credit.  x x x (At pp.
13-14)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We further held in the same case that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x x collaborating
testimony of the doctor who conducted the autopsy on the victim renders the
testimony of the eyewitnesses credible (At p. 14 citing People v. Encipido, 146
SCRA 478 [1986])."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the death of Gaudencio's wife, Dionisia, the
records teem with circumstantial evidence pointing to the accused-appellants as
the ones responsible therefor.  The
following circumstances are not disputed:  (1) Both children of the deceased spouses related in Court that when
they were able to free themselves from their father's attackers, both of them
immediately ran for their lives.  Flavio
Jamero jumped out of the window and after having landed on the ground, saw two
persons beating his mother.  Lourdes
Jamero, on the other hand, jumped out of the door where she saw her mother
lying face down on the ground near the stairs of their house (TSN, April 16,
1976, pp. 10-11; 54-55); (2) Three of the accused-appellants, namely Eulalio
Galendez, Narciso Acabo and Pedro Galendez admitted in open court that they
went to the house of the Jamero spouses on the evening of February 4, 1978, the
date and time of the fatal killing of both spouses; that their purpose in going
there was to have the aching shoulder of Pedro Galendez treated; and that the
said visit ended with the killing of Gaudencio Jamero as he was stabbed by Pedro
Galendez after an altercation between Gaudencio and Pedro ensued; (TSN, October
22, 1979, pp. 6-17; TSN, October 25, 1979, pp. 3-11; TSN, December 15, 1979,
pp. 6-15); (3) the defense of alibi given by the accused-appellant Felix Tadios
is unavailing considering that the distance between his house (where he
allegedly slept from nine o'clock in the evening of February 4, 1978 until four
o'clock the following morning) and the Jamero's residence is only two
kilometers and there was no showing that it was physically impossible for
accused-appellant Tadios to be at the scene of the crime at the time in
question; (4) Dr. Vicente Jadol asserted in his testimony that after having
conducted a post-mortem examination of the bodies of the deceased spouses on
February 6, 1978, he concluded that the Jamero spouses had been dead then for
36 to 48 hours (TSN, December 11, 1978, p. 28), thus, placing the time of death
at the time the accused-appellants could have been at the Jamero residence; and
(5) Emelio Llemit revealed in open court that the real purpose of the
accused-appellants in going to the house of the Jameros was to kill Gaudencio
because the latter was a "barangan" (witch) and that he, together
with Fabian Sajot and Carlos Tadios, was forced by the accused-appellants to
accompany the latter to the house of the Jameros in order to avenge the death
of one Eutiquio Baiño who allegedly died of Gaudencio's sorcery.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that the requirements under Rule 133, Section 4
of the Revised Rules of Evidence for circumstantial evidence to sustain a
conviction in the death of the wife are present in this case.  As we have held in the case of <u>People</u>
<u>v</u>. <u>Jara</u>, (144 SCRA 516 [1986]):</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x x </span>In
determining the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to support a conviction,
each case is to be determined on its own peculiar circumstances and all of the
facts and circumstances are to be considered together as a whole, and when so
considered, may be sufficient to support a conviction, although one or more of
the facts taken separately would not be sufficient for this purpose (23 CJS, p.
555).  <span style="">x x x" </span>(At p. 539)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Otherwise stated, before there can be conviction on the basis of
circumstantial evidence, the circumstances proved must constitute an unbroken
chain which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion pinpointing the
accused, to the exclusion of the all others, as the perpetrator of the crime
(see People v. Ganohon, 196 SCRA 431 [1991], citing People v. Ritter, 194 SCRA
690 [1991] and People v. Subano, 73 Phil. 692 [1942]; see also People v.
Tiozon, 198 SCRA 368 [1991]).  The
circumstances in this case are such that no doubt exists as to the finding that
the accused-appellants are also the ones responsible for Dionisia Jamero's
death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the presence of conspiracy is borne out by the
records considering that as found by the trial court all the accused-appellants
went to the house of Gaudencio Jamero for one definite purpose - to avenge the
death of Eutiquio Baiño and that the numerous wounds inflicted on the victims indicated
a plurality of assailants, all the accused-appellants are liable as
co-conspirators.  Hence, the act of one
is the act of all.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-entrenched rule that conspiracy need not be
established by direct evidence but may be proven through a series of acts done
in pursuance of a common unlawful purpose (People v. Alfredo Moreno, Jr. y
Andaya, et al., G.R. No. 94755, April 10, 1992 citing People v. Alvarez, 169
SCRA 730 [1989]; People v. Dante Donato, et. al., G.R. No. 94530, March 6, 1992
citing People v. Bicog, 187 SCRA 556 [1990]; People v. Quijano, et al. 197 SCRA
761 [1991]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, we need not dwell on the assigned error
raised by the accused-appellants in this appeal.  The extra-judicial confessions which clearly admitted their full
participation in the two crimes with full details are not essential to find
them guilty.  We simply note that the
accused-appellant's claim of maltreatment at the time of the taking of their
extrajudicial confessions are unsubstantiated by the evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 1, 1991 appellant Pedro D. Galendez, writing from his
dormitory in the New Bilibid Prison, urged the release of his co-appellants and
insisted that he was the sole criminal in the crimes.  The records prove otherwise.  Conspiracy is clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find no reversible error in the trial court's
findings of fact to which we accord full respect and credence in consonance
with the well-entrenched rule that the findings of the trial court should not
be disturbed on appeal, unless some facts or circumstances may have been
overlooked that may otherwise affect the result of the case considering that
the trial court has the privilege of observing the demeanor of the witnesses
while on the witness stand thereby allowing it to discern if the witnesses are
telling the truth or not.  (People v.
Vicente Rebulado, et al., G.R. No. L-42987, March 4, 1992 citing Amarante Heirs
v. Court of Appeals, et al., 155 SCRA 46 [1987]; People v. Gil Uy, et al., <u>supra</u>
citing People v. Kyamko, 192 SCRA 374 [1990]; People v. Lorenzo, 200 SCRA 207
[1991].</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, we find no error in the trial court's finding that
the aggravating circumstances as alleged in the informations of these
consolidated cases are present and well-supported by the established facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the penalty of death imposed by the trial court,
we reduce the same to <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> in view of the mandate
of the 1987 Constitution (Article III, section 19(1), 1987 Constitution).  The indemnity to the heirs of each of the
deceased spouses is raised to P50,000.00 pursuant to present
jurisprudence.  (People v. Dante Donato,
et al., <u>supra</u> citing People v. Sison, 189 SCRA 643 [1990]).</p>
