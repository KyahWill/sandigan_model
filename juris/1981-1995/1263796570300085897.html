issuance of said order of May 21, 1958, were lost and/or destroyed during World
War II and were still pending reconstitution; hence, the Reyes Court had no
authority to order the issuance of a certificate of title.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Realty and <span class="SpellE">Macondray</span> alleged in their

1958, was actually performing a purely ministerial duty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

purchase price which the corporation paid to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, QCDFC failed to prosecute its case,
and the fourth-party complaint was dismissed for lack of interest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">IAC </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>Said resolution of July 25, 1983, to Our view, was effectively an
acknowledgment by the Division that promulgated it that the earlier Decision
dated December 29, 1983 rendered in a Special Civil Action case for <i>certiorari</i>,
CA-G.R. No. SP-13530, was not appropriate and beyond the authority of the Ninth
Division of the Court of Appeals to promulgate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The said Resolution was actually a statement that the Ninth Division of
the Court of Appeals had over-stepped its bounds by reviewing in <i>certiorari</i>
proceedings a decision in a purely civil case that should have passed through
the processes of an ordinary appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
are not aware of any legal doctrine that permits an appellate court to treat a
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> upon purely questions of law, such as
that filed by petitioners herein, as an ordinary appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither can we find any legal basis or
justification for the elimination by the appellate court of the essential
requisites then prescribed for the validity of an appeal, such as the
submission of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>formal notice <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of </span>appeal, an appeal bond and approved
record on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without any of these
mandatory requisites, the appeal could not have been deemed perfected and ought
to have been dismissed outright.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court does not agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are two modes by which cases decided by the then Courts of
First Instance in their original jurisdiction may be reviewed:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) an ordinary appeal either to the Supreme
Court or to the Court of Appeals, or (2) an appeal on <i>certiorari</i> to the
Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the latter category
belong cases in which only errors or questions of law are involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each of these modes have different procedural
requirements.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">As stated earlier, Realty
originally filed Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with this Court docketed as
G.R. No. L-56471 questioning the decision of the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Vera Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, and asking that it be allowed to appeal
directly to this Court as it was raising only questions of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this Court referred the case to the
Court of Appeals "in aid of its appellate jurisdiction for </span>p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">roper determination on the merits o</span>f<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the <u>appeal</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It may thus be observed that even this Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">treated </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">petition </span>first filed as an appeal, and not as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">special civil action for </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

14.0pt">After all, </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">petition
for review by <i>certiorari</i> is also a form of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Resuello</span>,
L-30165, August 22, 1969, 69 SCRA 35)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">This

13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">45 </span>which, unlike ordinary appeals,
does not require a notice of appeal, an appeal bond and a record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus it was error for the IAC to hold that the Decision of the <st1:street><st1:address>Vera
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> "cannot be passed upon anymore in the
Court of Appeals decision because appeal and not <i>certiorari</i> was the
proper remedy." Precisely, petitioners brought the case to this Court on
appeal, albeit by way of <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Carpo</span> cites authorities
holding that <i>certiorari</i> is not a substitute for appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those cases are not in point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They refer to the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>
under Rule 65, and not to appeal by way of <i>certiorari </i>under Rule 45.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the IAC Special Civil Cases Division erred in

</span>A perusal of said Resolution shows that it merely made clarification

it "erased or cancelled" the validity of the Decision of the Ninth
Division.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even the IAC Special Third Civil Cases Division impliedly
admitted the validity of the Decision of the Ninth Division when it granted <span class="SpellE">Carpo's</span> motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would have been incongruous to grant a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">motion to reconsider a decision, reverse and
set it aside, if in the first place it did not have </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">any </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

necessary only to declare its invalidity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In the third assigned
error, Petitioners contend that the <st1:street><st1:address>Vera Court</st1:address></st1:street>,
and the IAC Special Third Civil Cases Division, erred in upholding the validity
of the title in the name of <span class="SpellE">Carpo</span> and declaring null

of Realty and of QCDFC.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The basis of the complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">Carpo</span>,
which was the same basis for the rulings of the Vera Court and the IAC Special

of registration in favor of <span class="SpellE">Mayuga</span>, <span class="SpellE">predeccessor</span>-in-interest of Realty, as it was not sitting as

still pending reconstitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Act No. 496, Land Registration Act, (1902) as amended by Act
No. 2347 (1914); jurisdiction over all applications for registration of title

reconstitution of records in the Supreme Court, now including the Court of
Appeals, from Sec. 54 to Sec. 74; for the reconstitution of records in the
