				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Gonzales y
Baron was charged with violation of Sec. 15. Art. Ill of RA 6425, otherwise
known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended, before the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Branch 146. The facts as found by
the trial court are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="6" month="8">6 August 1991</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">three o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon, the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Enforcement Unit of the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Police Station received confidential information
from a certain "<span class="SpellE">Lito</span>" that herein
accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Gonzales (hereinafter
referred to as Gonzales) was selling "<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>"
at <st1:street><st1:address>Ponte St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Tejeros</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila. Immediately, Pfc. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span>,
the operation officer of the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, organized a team composed of Policewoman Elizabeth
Mendoza, Patrolman Romeo Santos and Pfc. Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Niedo</span>,
to entrap the accused. <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city> was
assigned to act as poseur-buyer and was furnished with two (2) one hundred peso
bills with serial numbers VJ 630420 and JT 330435 and marked with the initials
of the unit NDDEU above the serial number on the right side of the bills.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six o’clock</st1:time> in
the evening of the same day (<st1:date year="1991" day="6" month="8">6 August
 1991</st1:date>), the team together with “<span class="SpellE">Lito</span>”, the
informant, proceeded to <st1:street><st1:address>Ponte St.</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Tejeros</span> in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to survey the area. From the service car, the informant pointed to the alleged
pusher, herein Gonzales, who was standing in front of his house at <st1:street><st1:address>4183
  Ponte St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Tejeros</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Niedo</span> posted themselves across the street, about
twenty (20) meters away from Gonzales. Mendoza who was in civilian clothes then
approached Gonzales and asked the latter if he knew a person by the name “<span class="SpellE">Lito</span>”. Gonzales acknowledged to knowing “<span class="SpellE">Lito</span>” and asked <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
her reason for asking. Mendoza replied that she wanted to buy “P2.00 of <span class="SpellE">bato</span>”, a street “lingo” which means two (2) decks of <span class="SpellE">shabu</span> or methamphetamine hydrochloride for P200.00 or
P100.00 per deck, and she gave the two (2) marked one hundred peso bills to
Gonzales in payment for the “<span class="SpellE">bato</span>” which she was
purchasing. Gonzales thereupon gave <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
a white crystalline substance contained in a transparent plastic bag. The
exchange was seen by <span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span> and the other members
of the team from a distance of about twenty (20) meters away. However, they
could not clearly identify the object of the exchange.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having concluded the purchase, <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
scratched her right ear, a pre-arranged signal for her companions to move in.
Upon seeing the signal, the other members of the team moved in and arrested
Gonzales. Gonzales was frisked and the two (2) marked one hundred peso bills
and another plastic bag containing a white crystalline substance was found in
his possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gonzales was brought to the police station for investigation. The
white crystalline substance placed in a transparent plastic bag found in the
possession of Gonzales and the similar substance purchased by Mendoza from him
were referred for examination to the Forensic Chemistry Section of the PNP
Crime Laboratory Service. The substance having a total weight of .92 grams was
identified as methamphetamine hydrochloride commonly known as "<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>", a regulated drug. <a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Consequently, Gonzales was charged before the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> with a violation of the Dangerous
Drugs Act, committed, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 6th day of August, 1991, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Metro Manila, Philippines
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without
being authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously deliver and sell Methamphetamine Hydrochloride (<span class="SpellE">Shabu</span>),
which is a regulated drug, in consideration of P200.00." <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Upon arraignment, Gonzales entered a plea
of not guilty. <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
He denied having sold "<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>" to the police
officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented a different version of the incident,
alleging that the members of the buy-bust team raided Gonzales’ residence
without a warrant, and that their search of Gonzales' person and residence did
not yield any regulated drug or marked money. The witnesses for the defense
testified that the buy-bust team took the money of Gina Mariano, the live-in
partner of Gonzales and a witness for the defense, amounting to P17,000.00
placed inside a cabinet found on the ground floor living area of Gonzales’
residence. They (defense witnesses) further claimed that they were illegally
detained by the police authorities.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1992" day="8" month="1">8 January 1992</st1:date>,
the trial court found Gonzales guilty beyond reasonable doubt of delivering and
selling methamphetamine hydrochloride (<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>) and was
sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of
P20,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by Gonzales but the same
was denied on <st1:date year="1992" day="31" month="1">31 January 1992</st1:date>,
<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gonzales assails the decision of the trial court on the ground
that the evidence failed to establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is
Gonzales' contention that the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution
are not credible because they are contradictory; that there was actually no
buy-bust operation conducted by the team of <span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span>
and that the evidence against him was planted; that his arrest was illegal; and
that the constitutional presumption of his innocence prevails over the
presumption that official duty of the arresting police officers was regularly
performed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After carefully going over the records of the case, we find no
merit in Gonzales' claim that the testimonies of the witnesses for the
prosecution are not credible. The trial court's findings on the matter of
credibility of the witnesses are entitled to the highest degree of respect and
will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any showing that it
overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight
and substance which would have affected the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that there are contradictions and inconsistencies in
the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses. However, these inconsistencies
involve minor details which are not sufficient to overcome the evidence against
Gonzales and do not affect the veracity of the testimony of said witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span>
and Mendoza are inconsistent on some points. Thus -</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span> testified that their unit
received the information that Gonzales was selling "<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>"
at Ponte St., <span class="SpellE">Tejeros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
at around six o'clock in the evening of 6 August 1991; that only Santos, <span class="SpellE">Neido</span> and Mendoza went to survey the area while he was left
at police station and he merely followed them afterwards; that while Mendoza
was negotiating with Gonzales for the purchase of "<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>",
the other members of the team positioned themselves at about twenty (20) meters
away from where Gonzales and Mendoza were standing; that after the negotiation,
Mendoza scratched her head to signal her companions to move in; and that the
marked money was recovered from Gonzales’ pocket.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Mendoza testified that they received the
information of <span class="SpellE">shabu</span> pushing at Ponte St., <span class="SpellE">Tejeros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> at three o'clock
in the afternoon of 6 August 1991; that <span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span> was
present during the surveillance; that the other members of the team observed
the negotiation between her and Gonzales at about five (5) to ten (10) meters
away; that she scratched her right ear to signal her companions to move in on
Gonzales after the negotiation; and that the marked money was recovered from
Gonzales' right hand.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite these inconsistencies, on the whole, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span> corroborates that of Mendoza as to the material
points that information of <span class="SpellE">shabu</span> pushing at Ponte
St., <span class="SpellE">Tejeros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> was
received by the Narcotics and Dangerous Enforcement Unit of the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Police Station in the afternoon of 6 August 1991;
that a buy-bust operation was immediately organized composed of <span class="SpellE">Viacrusis</span>, Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Neido</span> and
Ramos; that two (2) one hundred peso bills were marked with the initials of
their unit to be used in the operation; that a surveillance of the area was
conducted by the team; that Mendoza acted as poseur-buyer and she entered into
a negotiation with Gonzales to purchase "<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>"
while the other members of the team witnessed the negotiation at a distance;
that Mendoza gave the pre-arranged signal to her companions to move in after
the negotiation by scratching her ear; and that Gonzales was caught in
possession of the marked one hundred peso bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">The imputed inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses on minor details, in our view, reinforce rather than weaken their
credibility for the reaction of different persons when confronted with a
shocking or unusual incident can vary. Testimonial discrepancies could be
caused by the natural fickleness of memory, which tend to strengthen, rather
than weaken, credibility as they erase any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The witnesses testifying on the same event do not have to be consistent in
every detail as differences in recollections or viewpoints or impressions are
inevitable. Total recall or perfect harmony is not required. As long as the
witnesses concur on material points, slight differences in their remembrance of
the details do not reflect on the essential veracity of their testimony.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Mendoza's failure to officially record in the police blotter or logbook
the information they received on 6 August 1991 that <span class="SpellE">shabu</span>
was being sold at Ponte St., <span class="SpellE">Tejeros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> and the other details of the buy-bust operation,
such as the names of the poseur-buyer and the back-up officers, serial numbers
of the money marked for use of the operation, does not automatically render the
testimonies of the members of the buy-bust team as untrustworthy. Entries in
the police blotter are merely <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence of the facts
stated therein and they are not conclusive.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Gonzales’ defense consisting of a denial of the act of selling a
regulated drug to <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city> and
alleging in the process that he was framed-up by the police officers, is weak
and insufficient to overthrow the positive testimonies of the police officers
who conducted the buy-bust operation. No ill-motive on the part of the police
officers was presented to disprove the veracity of their testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a presumption applied in cases involving violations of
the Dangerous Drugs Act of regularity in the performance of duty by police
officers conducting buy-bust operations. When police officers have no motive
for testifying falsely against the accused, courts are inclined to upholding
the presumption of regularity in the performance of duty by police officers,
although the presumption by itself cannot prevail over the constitutional
presumption of innocence accorded the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
But the defense that accused was framed-up by the police officers requires
stronger proof than bare assertion because of this presumption of regularity in
the performance of their official duties by police officers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The arrest of Gonzales without a warrant by the police officers
who conducted the buy-bust operation is lawful. Having caught the accused <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>flagrante</u></span> as a result of the buy-bust
operation, the police officers were not only authorized but were duty bound to
apprehend the accused, even without a warrant of arrest. The immediate search
of Gonzales as a consequence of such valid arrest was also legal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
