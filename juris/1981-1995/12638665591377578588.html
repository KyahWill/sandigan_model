				<H3>F. DAVID ENTERPRISES, REPRESENTED BY OWNER/PROPRIETOR, FRANCISCO DAVID AND NORMA DAVID, PETITIONERS, VS. INSULAR BANK OF ASIA AND AMERICA (IBAA) NOW PHILIPPINE COMMERCIAL INTERNATIONAL BANK, THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH XLI (41), SAN FERNANDO, PAMPANGA AND/OR THE COURT OF APPEALS, FORMERLY IAC, FORMER SPECIAL NINTH DIVISION, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For alleged non-payment of obligations secured by a real estate
mortgage executed by Francisco and Norma David in its favor on <st1:date year="1980" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1980</st1:date>, IBAA instituted <span style="">extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The auction sale </span>was <span style="">held on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="8"><span style="">August 11, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> and the mortgaged property was </span>sold
to IBAA as the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
certificate of sale was registered on <st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="8">August
 13, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After one year, no
redemption having been effected by the mortgagors, ownership of the land was
consolidated in IBAA and a new certificate of title was issued in its name on <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="12">December
 30, 1984</st1:date>, IBAA filed a petition for a<span style=""> </span>writ of possession over the said lot in what was subsequently
docketed as LRC No. 145 in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
Branch 41.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was granted on <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1985</st1:date>, and the writ prayed
for was issued on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1985</st1:date>,
the David spouses filed a motion to recall the writ and dismiss LRC No. 145,
calling the attention of the trial court to two other pending cases involving
the subject property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first was
Civil Case No. 6169 in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
Branch <span style="">44, which was a petition to
prohibit the foreclosure sale </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">the ground that the real transaction between
the parties </span>was not <span style="">a </span>real
estate mortgage but a trust receipt agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The second was Civil Case No. 6565 in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, Branch 45, where the mortgagors were seeking the
cancellation of <span class="SpellE">IBAA's</span> transfer certificate of title
on the ground of the nullity of the foreclosure sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this latter case, the trial court had issued
<span style="">a </span>preliminary injunction order
against IBAA dealing with or entering into the possession of the subject lot
although the writ itself had not yet been granted because the petitioner's bond
was still awaiting approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">Informed of these cases, Judge Felipe <span class="SpellE">Kalalo</span>
of Branch 41<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>recalled the writ of possession and
dismissed LRC No. 145 on March 6, 1985.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This prompted IBAA to file a motion for reconsideration on March 21,
1985, where it argued that since the petitioner's bond had not yet been
approved in Civil Case No. 6565, the injunction order issued therein should be
regarded only as a temporary <span style="">restraining
order which under BP No. 224 should be deemed to have expired after twenty days
from issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="4"><span style="">April 2,
 1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, on the ground
that the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> had earlier recognized the validity
of the injunction order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, two important developments transpired in Civil Case
No. 6565 that affected LRC No. 145.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first was the approval of the indemnity bond and the issuance of the writ of
preliminary injunction by Judge Pedro <span class="SpellE">Laggui</span> on <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second was the dismissal of the <span style="">complaint itself on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="11"><span style="">November
 20, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, on the
ground that the foreclosure sale had been validly held because the order issued
in Civil Case No. 6169 to restrain the said sale had been served tardily on the
provincial sheriff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1986</st1:date>,
IBAA filed a second motion for reconsideration in LRC No. 145, arguing that in
view of the dismissal of <span style="">Civil </span>Case
No. 6565 and the consequent lifting of the writ of preliminary injunction,
there was no more reason for not issuing the writ of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion <span style="">was also denied, the trial court holding <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that it had no more jurisdiction over the case
because its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="4"><span style="">April 2, </span><span style="">1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, not
having been seasonably appealed, had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing daunted, IBAA filed a manifestation and motion on <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1986</st1:date>, reiterating its earlier
arguments and adding that its second motion for reconsideration should at least
be treated as anew petition for <span style="">a </span>writ
of possession that under the circumstances should now be <span style="">granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>This was likewise denied, the court ruling in its resolution
dated April 4, 1986, that a second motion for reconsideration was not allowed,
and much less a third, under the interim Rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="5"><span style="">May 8</span>, 1986</st1:date>, IBAA filed a
petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> and <i><u>mandamus</u></i> with
preliminary mandatory injunction with the Court of Appeals questioning Judge <span class="SpellE">Kalalo's</span> refusal to issue the writ of possession and its
order of <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1986</st1:date>,
denying its second <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> <span style="">motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a decision dated </span><st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="11"><span style="">November
 28, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
respondent court reversed the trial court and ordered it to issue the writ of
possession.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of the decision was sent by registered mail to <span style="">the </span>petitioner's counsel at his address
of record at Suite 349 Isabel Building, <span class="SpellE">España</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
but remained unclaimed despite registry notices sent to him on <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1986</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1986</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1986</st1:date>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1987</st1:date>,
IBAA filed with the trial court a motion for the issuance of the writ of
possession directed by the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies of the motion and the decision of the
respondent court were received by the petitioner’s counsel at his address of
record on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="2">February
 3, 1986</st1:date>, the petitioner filed a motion dated <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1987</st1:date>, asking for the resetting of the
hearing on the IBAA motion scheduled for <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion was denied, and on <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1987</st1:date>, the writ of possession was issued, <span style="">copy </span>of which was received by the petitioner on <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insisting that it had not yet been served with an official copy
of the decision of the respondent court, the petitioner requested from the
clerk of the Court of Appeals a certified copy thereof, which it received on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on this date that the
petitioner's counsel formally notified the respondent court of his new address
at his residence in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1987</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed a motion <span style="">for </span>reconsideration,
which was denied on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner was notified of the denial on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then came to this Court and was, on
motion, over the private respondent's opposition, granted a 25-day extension to
file the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was
finally filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="7">July <span style="">3, </span>1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the material dates shows that the motion for
reconsideration of the decision of the respondent court was filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner’s counsel
was deemed served with </span>a <span style="">copy of
the challenged decision on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="12"><span style="">December 8, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, five days after the first registry notice
sent to him on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="12"><span style="">December 3, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
applicable rule is Rule 13, Section 8 of the Rules of Court reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>SEC.<span style=""> </span>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Completeness of service</u> ?
Personal service is complete upon actual delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Service by ordinary mail is complete upon the
expiration of five (5) days after mailing, unless the court otherwise
provides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Service by registered mail is
complete upon actual receipt by the addressee; but if he fails <span style="">to </span>claim his mail from the post office
within five (5) days from the date of first notice of the postmaster, service
shall take effect at the expiration of such time.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The notice was sent to the address of record of the petitioner's
counsel, Atty. Reynaldo L. <span class="SpellE">Libanan</span>, which at that
time was still Suite 349 Isabel Building, <span class="SpellE">España</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His excuse for the delay in informing the
Court of Appeals of his new address is not satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims he was in mourning after his wife's
death sometime in September 1986 and preferred to transfer his office to his <span style="">residence where, besides saving on expenses,
he could also give moral support to his grieving children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he styles his law office as "R. L. <span class="SpellE">Libanan</span> and Associates," there would have been
associates to </span>attend <span style="">to </span>the
simple task of <span style="">notifying the respondent
court of his change of address, let alone collecting the mail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Court notes that although the
claims to have transferred his office to his residence sometime in October
1986, he nevertheless still received, on January 26, 1987, a copy of the motion
for </span>a <span style="">writ of possession, with a
copy of the decision attached, at his old address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is admitted in his Motion for
Postponement dated </span><st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="1"><span style="">January 29, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite all this, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Libanan</span> declared in
his Manifestation dated </span><st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="3"><span style="">March 28, 1987</span></st1:date><span style=""> that he "had not received a copy of the
said decision until </span><st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="2"><span style="">FEBRUARY, 26, 1987</span></st1:date><span style=""> upon request" and thus ensnared himself
in an obvious prevarication.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Deceptiveness ill becomes a member of the bar and officer </span>of <span style="">the court, more so if it is intended to
effect a miscarriage </span>of <span style="">justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are incontrovertible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the respondent court was promulgated on <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conformably to Rule 13, Section 8, of the
Rules of Court, service thereof on the petitioner at his address of record was
deemed completed on <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner had 15 days, or until <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1986</st1:date>, within which to
file a motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion <span style="">was </span>actually filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1987</st1:date>, or 79 days
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision had then long become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and could no longer be disturbed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this justification alone, the present petition can be denied
outright.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues, however, that it is IBAA that was tardy
because the decision of the trial court dated <st1:date year="1985" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1985</st1:date>, was no longer <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
when it was elevated to the respondent <span style="">court
after </span>three motions for reconsideration thereof were all denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the respondent court had no jurisdiction
to entertain the appeal, it is its own decision of <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1986</st1:date>, that is totally null and void
and can be challenged <span style="">any </span>time.</p>

<p class="BODY">This seems a neat way of turning the tables but it comes rather
late in the day, considering the circumstances of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noted that not a word on <span style="">jurisdiction </span>was said by the petitioner
in the Court of Appeals, where the decision of the trial court was extensively
discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only after it was reversed
did it occur to the petitioner to question the competence of the respondent
court and, at that, not even immediately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question was not raised in its motion for reconsideration of <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue was hardly touched in its petition
with this Court dated <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not mentioned at all in its reply
dated <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in its memorandum dated <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1988</st1:date>, that it was
finally roused into challenging the jurisdiction it had neglected for so long
to impugn.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly held that where a party voluntarily submits to
the jurisdiction of the court and thereafter loses on the merits, he may not thereafter
be heard to say that the court had no jurisdiction after all.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
"The party is barred from such conduct not because the judgment or order
of the court is valid and conclusive as an adjudication but for the reason that
such a practice <span style="">cannot be tolerated -
obviously for reasons of public </span><span style="">policy."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But the more important consideration is that, as the respondent
court correctly observed, the issuance of a writ of possession in a land
registration case is a mere post-judgment incident that is governed by special
rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that the buyer in a foreclosure sale becomes the
absolute owner of the property purchased if it is not redeemed during the
period of one year after the registration of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, he is entitled to the possession of
the said property and can demand it at any time following the consolidation of
ownership in his name and the issuance to him of a new transfer certificate of
title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The buyer can in fact demand
possession of the land even during the redemption period except that he has to
post a bond in accordance with Section 7 of Act No. 3133 as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such bond is required after the redemption
period if the property is not redeemed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Possession of the land then becomes an absolute right of the purchaser
as confirmed owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon proper
application and proof of title, the issuance of the writ of possession becomes
a ministerial duty of the court.</p>

<blockquote>There is no law in this jurisdiction whereby the purchaser at a
sheriff's sale of real property is obliged to bring a separate and independent
suit for possession after the one-year period for redemption <span style="">has </span>expired and after he has obtained
the sheriff's final certificate of sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is neither legal ground nor reason of public policy precluding the
court from ordering the sheriff in this case to yield possession of the
property purchased at public auction where it appears that the judgment debtor
is the one in possession thereof and no rights of third persons are involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This same ruling was made in Rivera vs. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, 61 Phil. 201 (1935)
(judicial foreclosure of mortgage) and Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Nable</span>,
G.R. No. L-4979, <st1:date year="1952" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1952</st1:date>
(execution sale).<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>therefore affirm
and adopt the following ruling of the respondent court:</p>

<blockquote>We are of the considered opinion that the finality of the order of
respondent court dated <st1:date year="1985" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1985</st1:date>
recalling the writ of possession previously issued and dismissing the case did
not divest the lower court of jurisdiction to entertain in subsequent petition
for writ of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly argued
by petitioner, the land registration (LRC Case No. 145), which brought the
property within the ambit of the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system, has
long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decree ordering the registration of the
property under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system in that proceeding
took place several years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action
for a writ of possession filed in the same land registration case is a <u>mere
post-judgment incident</u> that is not subject to the rules of ordinary
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For how can <span style="">a </span>post-judgment incident <span style="">in </span>a land registration case be subject
to the rules of ordinary appeal when the main special proceedings have already
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and cannot be appealed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>If the purchaser at a sheriff's sale of real property is not
obliged to bring a<span style=""> </span>separate and
independent suit for possession after the expiration of the one-year redemption
period and after the issuance by the sheriff of the final certificate of sale,
we find no cogent reason why the lower court should be divested of its
jurisdiction to entertain <span style="">a </span>subsequent
petition for writ of possession <span style="">after
the original writ was recalled and the period to appeal said order has expired,
especially so that the legal bar (alleged injunction) has already been
dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that the
respondent court's order dated March 6, 1985 recalling the writ of possession
it previously issued an ordering the dismissal of the petition (LRC Case </span>No.
<span style="">145) should be construed, </span>to <span style="">say the least, as a dismissal without
prejudice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, respondent court
basically anchored its order of dismissal </span>on <span style="">two grounds, namely:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the petition was
pre-mature, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the existence of an
alleged injunction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>By virtue of the decision dated <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1985</st1:date> rendered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Laggui</span>
in Civil Case No. 6565 previously quoted, the above-enumerated grounds for the
order of dismissal of respondent judge ceased to exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no longer any legal bar for the
issuance of a subsequent writ of possession which petitioner <span style="">is </span>rightfully entitled to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Legal technicalities should be brushed aside
to pave the way for the dispensation of substantial justice.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, we agree that the second motion for reconsideration
filed by IBAA should have been considered a new application for a writ of
possession although it was not correctly captioned <span style="">as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the text and
purpose and not the designation of a pleading that should control</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> lest a mere technicality deprive a party of
a substantial right because of a fastidious obsession with formality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary rule would forever deprive IBAA of
the means to possess and enjoy the property it had </span>acquired in <span style="">the foreclosure sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The new application for a writ of possession should have been
granted, especially since the reason for the withdrawal of the earlier writ had

<blockquote>The right of the petitioner to the possession of the property is
clearly unassailable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is </span>founded on its right of
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the purchaser of the
properties <span style="">in </span>the foreclosure
sale, and to which the respective titles thereto have already been issued,
petitioner's right over the property has become absolute, vesting upon him the
right of possession over an enjoyment of the property which the Court must aid
in effecting its delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After such
delivery, the purchaser becomes the absolute owner of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we said in Tan <span class="SpellE">Soo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Huat</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Ongwico</span>, the deed of conveyance entitled the purchaser to
have and to hold the purchased property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This means, that the purchaser is entitled to go immediately upon the
real property, and this it is the Sheriff's inescapable duty to place him in
such possession.</blockquote>
