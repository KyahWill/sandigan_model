				<H3>REYNALDO R. BAYOT, PETITIONER, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN (SECOND DIVISION) AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
Petitioner Reynaldo R. Bayot is one of the several persons accused in 
more than one hundred (100) counts of Estafa thru Falsification of 
Public Documents before the Sandiganbayan.  The said charges stemmed 
from his alleged involvement, as a government auditor of the Commission 
on Audit assigned to the Ministry of Education and Culture, together 
with some officers/employees of the said Ministry, the Bureau of 
Treasury and the Teachers' Camp in Baguio City, in the preparation and 
encashment of fictitious TCAA checks for non-existent obligations of the
 Teachers' Camp resulting in damage to the government of several million
 pesos.  The first thirty-two (32) cases were filed on July 25, 1976.
<p>
In the meantime, petitioner ran for the post of municipal mayor of 
Amadeo, Cavite in the local elections held in January 1980.  He was 
elected.
</p><p>
On May 30, 1980, the Sandiganbayan promulgated a decision convicting 
herein petitioner and some of his co-accused in all but one of the 
thirty-two (32) cases filed against them.  Whereupon, appeals were taken
 to this Court and the cases are now pending review in G. R. Nos. 
L-54645-76.
</p><p>
However; on March 16, 1982, Batas Pambansa Blg. 195 was passed amending,
 among others, Section 13 of Republic Act No. 3019.  The said section, 
as amended, reads -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 13.  <em>Suspension of and Loss of Benefits</em>.  Any 
incumbent public officer against whom any criminal prosecution under a 
valid information under this Act or under Title 7, Book II of the 
Revised Penal Code or for and offense involving fraud upon government or
 public funds or property whether as a simple or as a complex offense 
and in whatever stage of execution and mode of participation, is pending
 in court, shall be suspended from office.  Should he be convicted by 
final judgment he shall lose all retirement or gratuity benefits under 
any law, but if acquitted, he shall be entitled to reinstatement and to 
the salaries and benefits which he failed to receive during suspension, 
unless in the meantime administrative proceedings had been filed against
 him."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thereafter, in other cases pending before the respondent court in which 
herein petitioner is one of the accused, the prosecution filed a motion 
to suspend all the accused-public officers <em>pendente lite</em> from their respective offices or any other public office which they may be occupying pending trial of their cases.
</p><p>
On July 22, 1982, respondent court issued an order directing the 
suspension of all the accused including herein petitioner "from their 
public positions or from any other public office that they may be 
holding x x x " (p. 26, Rollo).
</p><p>
Herein petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration alleging that "to 
apply the provision of Batas Pambansa Blg. 195 to the herein accused 
would be violative of the constitutional guarantee of protection against
 an <em>ex post facto law</em>" (p. 28, Rollo).  The motion was denied 
by respondent court in a resolution dated September 6, 1982.  Hence, 
this petition for certiorari.
</p><p>
It is the submission of petitioner that respondent court acted without 
jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction amounting to lack of 
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in suspending petitioner 
from office as Mayor of Amadeo, Cavite, <em>pendente lite</em> because -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.      Republic Act 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and 
Corrupt Practices Act, as amended by Batas Pambansa Blg. 195, is a penal
 statute in which case the provision of said Act must be strictly 
construed in favor of the accused and against the State;
  </p>
  <p>
    2.      A close perusal of Batas Pambansa Blg. 195, as well as the 
proceedings therein of the Batas Pambansa is absent of the legislative 
intent to have said Batas Pambansa Blg. 195 applied retroactively;
  </p>
  <p>
    3.      In the supposition that Batas Pambansa Blg. 195 is to be 
applied retroactively, its application would violate the Constitutional 
provision against enactment of <em>ex post facto law</em>; and,
  </p>
  <p>
    4.      Petitioner cannot be suspended to the position of which he 
was duly elected by the people of Amadeo, Cavite, based on an act which 
has nothing to do with his present position.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We find no merit in petitioner's contention that Section 13 of Republic 
Act 3019, as amended by Batas Pambansa Blg. 195, which includes the 
crime of Estafa thru Falsification of Public Document as among the 
crimes subjecting the public officer charged therewith with suspension 
from office pending action in court, is a penal provision which violates
 the constitutional prohibition against the enactment of <em>ex post facto law</em>.
   Paragraph 3 of Article 24 of the Revised Penal Code clearly states 
that suspension from the employment or public office during the trial or
 in order to institute proceedings shall not be considered as penalty.  
It is not a penalty because it is not imposed as a result of judicial 
proceedings.  In fact, if acquitted, the official concerned shall be 
entitled to reinstatement and to the salaries and benefits which he 
failed to receive during suspension.  Those mentioned in paragraph Nos. 
1, 3 and 4 of said Article 24 are merely preventive measures before 
final judgment.  Not being a penal provision, therefore, the suspension 
from office, pending trial of the public officer charged with crimes 
mentioned in the amendatory provision committed before its effectivity 
does not violate the constitutional provision on <em>ex post facto law</em>.
  Further, the claim of petitioner that he cannot be suspended because 
he is presently occupying a position different from that under which he 
is charged is untenable.  The amendatory provision clearly states that 
any incumbent public officer against whom any criminal prosecution under
 a valid information under Republic Act 3019 or for any offense 
involving fraud upon the government or public funds or property whether 
as a simple or as a complex offense and in whatever stage of execution 
and mode of participation, is pending in court, shall be suspended from 
office.  Thus, by the use of the word "office" the same applies to any 
office which the officer charged may be holding, and not only the 
particular office under which he was charged.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, instant petition for certiorari is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
