				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Lualhati</span> was charged
with Rape by his common-law wife's 11-year-old daughter, Josephine <span class="SpellE">Dimaunahan</span>, in a complaint (Exhibit D, p. 1, Records) filed
in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the
preliminary investigation, the case was forwarded to the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, where the Provincial Fiscal filed on <st1:date year="1979" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1979</st1:date> the following
information against the appellant:</p>

<blockquote><i>"That in or about the month of June 1978, at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Masalucot</span> 2, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the said accused, by means of <span class="SpellE">roce</span>
(sic) and intimidation, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of one Josephine M. <span class="SpellE">Dimaunahan</span>, a minor, 11 years of age, against her will.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"That in the commission of the above-described crime, the
following aggravating circumstances were present: relationship, the accused
being the step-father of the offended party, and dwelling.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>"Contrary to law."</i></span><i> <span class="GramE">(Annex A, p. 6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As summarized in the People's brief, (p. 92, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
the facts are:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Complainant Josephine <span class="SpellE">Dimaunahan</span>
was born on </i><st1:date year="1967" day="7" month="1"><i>January 7, 1967</i></st1:date><i>
(p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Sept. 10, 1980).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>About eight (8) years before the June, 1978
incident in question, her mother separated from her father and started to live
with appellant Vicente <span class="SpellE">Lualhati</span> without the benefit
of marriage (pp. 36-40, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Jan. 7, 1981; pp. 5-6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Nov. 19, 1981; pp. 7-12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Dec. 10, 1981; pp. 3-4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Jan. 14, 1982).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She likewise lived with appellant who
supported her, took care of her studies and treated her like his own daughter
(p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Sept. 10, 1980; pp. 13-14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Dec. 10, 1981; pp. 4-5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Jan. 14, 1982).<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Sometime in June, 1978, while complainant's mother was at
work, appellant and complainant were alone in the house in <span class="SpellE">Masalukot</span>
II, <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> appellant had sexual intercourse with complainant (pp.
9-15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </i><st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="9"><i>Sept. 10, 1980</i></st1:date><i>; pp. 8-14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
</i><st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="10"><i>Oct. 8, 1980</i></st1:date><i>;
pp. 11-16, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </i><st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="10"><i>Oct. 21, 1981</i></st1:date><i>; pp. 4-5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
</i><st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="11"><i>Nov. 3, 1982</i></st1:date><i>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appeared that even prior to June, 1978, appellant
had already several sexual relations with complainant (pp. 8-9, 20-23, 26, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </i><st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="1"><i>Jan. 7,
 1981</i></st1:date><i>; p. 20, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </i><st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="10"><i>Oct. 20, 1981</i></st1:date><i>)."</i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="11">November
 13, 1979</st1:date>, the accused pleaded not guilty (p. 120 Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1980</st1:date>,
the accused, through counsel, filed a motion to dismiss (p. 168, Records) on
the ground that the complaint charged more than one offense, namely:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>That on or about the month of June, 1978, <u>and</u> <u>for</u>
<u>sometime</u> <u>prior</u> <u>and</u> <u>subsequent</u> <u>thereto</u>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the accused Vicente <span class="SpellE">Lualhati</span> <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and
feloniously have carnal knowledge of the complainant Josephine M. <span class="SpellE">Dimaunahan</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Emphasis supplied.) <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> D, p. 1, Records).<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal’s</span> Opposition
(p. 195, Records) alleging that the accused was being tried on the Information
which charged only one offense committed “in or about the month of June 1978,”
the trial judge denied the motion to dismiss (p. 197, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>,
the accused filed another Motion to Dismiss (p. 44, Records), alleging that he
had been pardoned by the offended party, her mother and grandmother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the Motion to Dismiss was the
joint affidavit of desistance signed by the offended party, her mother and
grandmother on December 11, 1978 (p. 45, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1978, the offended party executed and filed an
affidavit alleging that her father abandoned her at the age of two (2) years
and three (3) months, without providing for her support and studies, and that
the same were provided by her mother and grandmother who, on the same date,
executed a joint affidavit to the same effect (p.46, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 6, 1979, the Prosecuting Fiscal filed an Addendum to
the Opposition to the Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> (p. 63,
Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleged therein that the
express pardon given the accused was invalid for the offended party did not
have “a will of her own”, being merely eleven (11) years old when the crime was
committed; that Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Dimaunahan</span>, father of the
offended party, executed and affidavit objecting to the pardon given to the
accused; and that, as the father, he still possessed the “patria <span class="SpellE">protesta</span>” over the offended party in spite of his having <span class="GramE">abandoned</span> her.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an Order dated March 7, 1979, the trial court denied the motion
to dismiss on account of the insistence of the victim’s father to prosecute the
accused, absent judicial pronouncement depriving him of parental authority over
the offended party, a child below twelve (12) years old (p. 73, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 9, 1979, a Motion to <span class="GramE">Quash</span>
(p. 117, Records) was filed by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was denied on November 15, 1979 by the trial court (p. 126,
Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo,</u> convicted the accused
of rape, and imposed upon him the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> (p. 549, Records).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal in which the appellant alleges that the trial
court erred:</p>

<blockquote><i>1. in not holding
void the complaint of the offended party charging the accused with more than
one offense;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>2. in giving due
course to the information filed by the prosecuting fiscal against the accused,
there being no valid complaint against him;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>3. in not giving
effect to the pardon given to the accused by the offended party, her mother and
grandmother; and <o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>4. in giving the
father of the offended party authority to prosecute the accused,
notwithstanding the fact that he had abandoned her while a child two years old
and had not provided for her support and studies” (p. 79, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Those assignments of error raise only two issues, namely: (1)
whether there was a valid complaint against the appellant; and (2) whether the
pardon given to him by the offended party, her mother, and grandmother
extinguished his criminal liability, in spite of the objection of the victim's
father.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, the appellant contends that the complaint is
void because it charges at least three (3) crimes of rape, namely: (1) that
which was committed "on or about the month of June, 1978;" (2) that
which was committed "sometime prior to said period;" and (3) that
which was committed "subsequent thereto." <span class="GramE">(p. 168,
Records.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument has no merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Attached to Josephine's complaint was her sworn statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E, p. 2, Records), taken before S/Sgt. Domingo V. <span class="SpellE">Averon</span>, Jr. of the 21st CIS Detachment at Camp Guillermo, <span class="SpellE">Nakar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City on August 8,
1978, wherein, she categorically affirmed that Vicente abused her before the
start of classes in June, 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
affidavit, which may be considered part of the complaint required by law, cures
any ambiguity in the complaint regarding the number of offenses committed by
the accused (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Babasa</span>, 97 SCRA 672).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Discrepancies between the accusation and the
complaint as to time of occurrence of the carnal copulations in rape do not
affect any essential right of the accused, where the acts occurred within the
period of time alleged in both writings and the difference noted in other
respects was of a formal, rather than a substantial, character. (Delos Santos
vs. People, 69 Phil. 321.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Section 10, Rule 110 of the 1964 Rules of Court
provided:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>Sec. 10.</i></span><i> <span class="GramE"><u>Time</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>commission</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>offense</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- It is not necessary to state in the
complaint or information the precise time at which the offense was committed
except when time is a material ingredient of the offense, but the act may be
alleged to have been committed at any time as near to the actual date at which
the offense was committed as the information or complaint will permit."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the efficacy of the pardon given to the appellant
by his victim, her mother, and grandmother, Article 344 of the Revised Penal
Code provides:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Art. <span class="GramE">344. <u>Prosecution</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>crimes</u> <u>of</u> <u>adultery</u>, <span class="SpellE"><u>concubinage</u></span><u>,</u>
<u>seduction</u>, <u>abduction</u>, <u>rape</u> <u>and</u> <u>acts</u> <u>of</u>
<u>lasciviousness</u>.</span> - x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"The offenses of seduction, abduction, <u>rape</u>, or acts
of lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the
offended party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor, in any case, if
the offender has been expressly pardoned by the above-named persons, as the
case may be.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"In cases of seduction, abduction, acts of lasciviousness
and <u>rape</u>, the marriage of the offender with the offended party shall
extinguish the criminal action or remit the penalty already imposed upon
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provisions of this paragraph
shall also be applicable to the co-principals, accomplices and accessories
after the fact of the above-mentioned crimes."</i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. Miranda (57 Phil. 274), this Court interpreted
paragraph 3 of Article 344 as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Paragraph 3 of the legal provision above-quoted prohibits
a prosecution for seduction, abduction, <u>rape</u>, or acts of lasciviousness,
except upon a complaint made by the offended party or her parents,
grandparents, or guardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been expressly
pardoned by the above-named persons, as the case may be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>It does not prohibit the continuance of a
prosecution if the offended party pardons the offender after the cause <span class="GramE">has been</span> instituted, nor does it order the dismissal of said
cause</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only act that according
to Article 344 extinguishes the penal action and the penalty that may have been
<span class="GramE">imposed,</span> is the marriage between the offender and the
offended party.” (Emphasis supplied.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the Miranda case involved the crime of seduction, the
ruling therein is applicable to rape inasmuch as the prosecution of both offenses
is covered by Article 344.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rationale
of the law on the prosecution of private crimes is simple: The law deems it the
wiser policy to let the aggrieved woman and her family decide whether to expose
to public view or to heated controversies in court the vices, faults and
disgraceful acts occurring in the family (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Babasa</span>,
97 SCRA 672).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, when, as in the
case at bar, the pardon is given <u>after</u> the filing of the complaint in
court, it comes too late to hide the shameful occurrence from public notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the accused herein pleaded not guilty when arraigned, he
admitted having carnal knowledge of Josephine many times, even prior to June
1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His allegation that he was
"tempted" by her would not mitigate, much less exculpate, him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In statutory rape it is not necessary to
prove that the victim was intimidated or that force was used against her
(People vs. Jones, 137 SCRA 166).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the trial court finding Vicente
<span class="SpellE">Lualhati</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of rape and
imposing upon him the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
is affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to present
judicial policy, the appellant is ordered to pay the offended party moral
damages in the increased sum of P25<span class="GramE">,000</span>, and the
costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
