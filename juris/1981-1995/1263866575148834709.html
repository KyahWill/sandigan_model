wood ("dos <span class="SpellE"><span style="">por</span></span><span style=""> dos").<span style="">&nbsp;

times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After beating the boy, Julio <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span> went outside and told <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>
not to talk or else <span style="">he </span>will also

Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> admitted to him that he (<span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>) killed Antonia <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, however, found the accused <span style="">Julio </span><span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span>
guilty of the crimes charged and sentenced him to suffer the penalties
hereinbefore stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this a<span style="">ppeal, </span>the
accused Julio <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span> assails the correctness of the
court's decision, contending mainly that the said <span style="">court </span>erred in convicting him of the crimes of Murder and
Parricide and in disregarding the testimony of witnesses supporting his claim
that Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> is the real culprit.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the issue of whether Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>
or the accused Julio <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span> is responsible for the
deaths of Antonia <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Igmedio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ambat</span>, Jr. involves the credibility <span style="">of </span>witnesses and we have repeatedly
upheld the well established rule that the highest degree of respect is accorded
to the findings of the trial court, the latter being in the position to observe
the demeanor and manner of testifying of the witnesses, unless there is a
showing that the trial court had overlooked certain facts of substance and <span style="">weight </span>that, if considered, might
affect the result of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And where
there <span style="">is </span>irreconcilable conflict
in the testimonies for the prosecution and for the defense, as in the instant
case, the appellate court will not disturb the findings of fact of the trial
court when the evidence of the prevailing party is adequate to sustain the
judgment appealed from.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have made a thorough and careful study of the record <span style="">of </span>these cases, and we find no cogent
reason to disturb the findings and conclusion of the trial court that the
accused Julio <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span> is guilty of the crimes
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found that the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses "are not <span style="">only congruous </span>and consistent but credible <span style="">and </span>straight forward" whereas
the defendant's alibi "was so weak that it can not impair and much less
shall prevail over the positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses who iden­tified
him as the very person who killed the deceased in the evening of 20 October
1985."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not also shown that the witnesses for the prosecution had
improper motives to testify falsely against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution witness Luciana <span class="SpellE">Calatrava</span> is a very close relative of the appellant, being
the <span style="">sister of </span>the appellant's
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would not have testified
against the accused if her testimony were not true.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court was correct in rejecting the alibi of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well settled that alibi
cannot prevail over the positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses and
their clear identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the
crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because alibi is a
defense that is inherently weak as it can be easily fabricated<span style=""> or </span>concocted.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, to establish an alibi, the accused must show that it was impossible
for him to have been at the scene of the cri<span style="">m</span>e at the time of its commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the instant cases, the accused declared that his house was only a
kilometer away from the house where his grandmother, <span style="">Antonia </span><span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span>, lived,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
so that it was not impossible for him to be at the house of his grandmother
when the crimes were committed.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not also commit error in rejecting the
appellant’s claim that Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> is the real
culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons advanced by him to
support his submission are not based upon convincing evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the appellant claims that Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> admitted to one Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> that he killed Antonia <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span>
because the old woman always scolded him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the veracity of this statement is dubious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>,
the admission of guilt was made to him on <st1:date year="1985" day="24" month="10">24 October 1985</st1:date>, while Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>
was detained at the <span class="SpellE">Kiamba</span> police station.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
If this admission of <span style="">guilt was in </span>fact
made, it would have been natural for the said Pat. <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>
to put his statement in writing in view of his sworn duty to uphold the law,
and the fact that Julio <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span> is his friend.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
But, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> failed to put down the alleged
statement in writing and he did not offer any plausible explanation why he did
not do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> declared that he did not know a policeman named <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, this alleged admission of guilt to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> appears to be an after-thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the motion for the reinvestigation of the
cases, filed by appellant's counsel on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="1">15
 January 1986</st1:date>, no mention was made of an admission to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground relied upon by the appellant's
counsel in said motion was that Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span> had
allegedly signed a written confession <span style="">in
</span>the presence of <span style="">Pat. </span>Romeo
<span class="SpellE">Atuel</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Daligdig</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant insists that Ruben <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>
is the person responsible for the deaths of Antonia <span class="SpellE">Tenebro</span>
