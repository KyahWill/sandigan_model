				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEES, VS. FEDERICO ESPINA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.<BR><BR>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Accused-appellant was charged with the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention in an Information filed by Provincial Fiscal Josephine K. Bayona reading as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 4th day of December 1982, in the Municipality of Pastrana, Province of Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court the said Federico Espina <i>alias</i> 'Dicoy' with deliberate intent, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously kidnap and carry away by force and intimidation Violeta Ponsil, a minor 18 years old against her will and consent for the purpose of permanently separating said Violeta Ponsil from her parents Lolita Ponsil and Conrado Ponsil, detaining said Violeta Ponsil until the present." (p. 71, <i>Rollo</i>)</blockquote>By virtue of a warrant of arrest, appellant was arrested on December 31, 1982. Upon arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to the crime charged. After trial, the judge rendered a decision,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">**</sup> its dispositive portion reading as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the accused guilty of the crime of kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention as charged in the Information with no mitigating or aggravating circumstances 2nd hereby sentences said accused to <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> and to pay the costs.<br><br>"It appearing that the accused has been detained since December 31, 1982 when he was arrested by the police authorities of Pastrana, Leyte, he should be credited with full time of his preventive imprisonment if the record shows that he has signed an agreement to abide by the same rules and regulations imposed upon convicted prisoners; otherwise, he should be credited with only four-fifths (4/5) of such prevention custody.<br><br>"SO ORDERED." (pp. 26-27, <i>Rollo</i>)</blockquote>On appeal, accused assigns the following errors:<br><blockquote><ol type="I"><li> The trial court erred in not finding that prosecution failed to establish the <i>corpus delicti</i>;<br><br></li><li> The trial court erred in not finding that the prosecution failed to establish the guilt of accused-appellant beyond reasonable doubt;<br><br></li><li> The trial court erred in not acquitting accused-appellant.</li></ol></blockquote>Evidence for the prosecution shows that at about 8:00 o'clock in the evening of December 4, 1982, appellant suddenly barged into the house of Conrado Ponsil with gun in hand, pointed at the spouses Conrado Ponsil and their 3 children Alejandro, Violeta and Jalyn. Seeing Violeta, he immediately dragged her towards the door and warned her parents not to follow them; otherwise, they would be shot. As the two eventually disappeared into the darkness outside nobody, out of fear, dared to follow appellant and Violeta who was crying and who could not resist appellant.<br><br>On the next day, Conrado Ponsil reported the incident to the barangay captain but he was ignored by the latter. Conrado waited for another day before reporting the incident to his compadre, Pat. Benjamin Montanejos, who noted the incident on the police blotter (Exh. A). Conrado was advised to go home and to wait for his daughter's return as she might ask for his forgiveness. Thereafter, Conrado had occasion to see appellant in the <i>barangay,</i> but he did not ask him regarding the whereabouts of his daughter. Neither did he go to appellant's residence. On the other hand, Montanejos received information that Violeta was taken to the house of a certain Lilia Niones and later to Castilla, Palo, Leyte. However, he did not take steps to verify the information.<br><br>Meanwhile on December 6, 1982, while Lolita was in the <i>poblacion,</i> she learned from Milagros Bernardino and Tranquilina Caiyas that Violeta was in the house of Lilia Niones. Nevertheless, she also did not take steps to verify the information although the house of Niones was only a half-kilometer away from her house. Neither did she ask for police assistance to verify such information. When his daughter Violeta failed to appear, Conrado Ponsil filed a case of kidnapping against appellant in the municipal court of Pastrana on December 28, 1982. Upon the arrest of appellant, he told Pat. Montanejos and Pat. Modesto that Violeta Ponsil already went home when asked about Violeta's whereabouts. Appellant was immediately detained at the municipal jail after his arrest and later transferred to the provincial jail in Tacloban City. Spouses Conrado and Lolita Ponsil knew about appellant's incarceration, but inexplicably they did not bother to ask him regarding Violeta's whereabouts.<br><br>On May 12, 1983, an information for kidnapping and serious illegal detention was filed against appellant in the regional trial court. At the trial, the evidence for the prosecution tended to establish the fact that accused is related to the mother of Violeta Ponsil; that he was a frequent visitor in the house of Violeta; that Conrado Ponsil was not aware that accused was courting his daughter Violeta; that at the time of the alleged kidnapping, accused was drunk; that the parents did not request the help of the police authorities or anyone to recover their daughter because they were afraid and that they were waiting all this time for their daughter to be returned to them.<br><br>On the other hand, appellant denies that he went to the house of spouses Conrado and Lolita Ponsil on the evening of December 4, 1982. Defense alleges that appellant who is a farmer was requested by Conrado and Lolita Ponsil to help clean the latter's ricefields. Violeta (Lolita's daughter) was among his companions there since she prepared food for her mother.<br><br>While working in the ricefields, appellant became attracted to Violeta, started courting her and eventually proposed that they be sweethearts. To such proposal, Violeta asked that she be given time to think it over. Appellant decided not to court Violeta in her residence because he had noticed that Violeta's parents were looking upon him with disfavor whenever he was conversing with Violeta.<br><br>During the month of December, 1982, appellant supervised the harvesting of palay in the ricefields of Delfin Espina and stayed in Delfin's camarin. On Saturday, December 4, 1982 he stayed in the camarin the whole day because no one else would be left behind. However, at about 8:00 that morning he received a letter from Violeta which was handcarried by his six-year old niece, Visitacion Niones. Since he was illiterate, he asked his cousin, Lilia Espina, to read it for him the following day. In that letter, Violeta accepted appellant's proposal of love and suggested that they elope in the evening of December 4, 1982 because her parents were very strict. Notwithstanding Violeta's willingness to elope, appellant dared not meet Violeta anymore, for fear of her parents.<br><br>On December 31, 1982, while appellant was slaughtering the carabao of his employer Delfin Espina in preparation for the New Year, he was arrested by Patrolmen Montanejos and Modesto on the charge of kidnapping Violeta Ponsil. Since then he has been detained (tsn, pp. 2-27. Oct. 13. 1983).<br><br>Rebuttal witnesses for the proceeding Gracita G. Modesto testified that she is familiar with the penmanship of Violeta Ponsil, who was her student in Grade II for the school year 1972-73, that the letter marked as Exh 1 is not in the handwriting of Violeta Ponsil who could hardly write her name.<br><br>Visitacion Niones <i>alias</i> "Betty" six years old testified that she knows the appellant but she did not answer when asked if she knows Violeta Ponsil. She also could not remember when asked whether she delivered a letter to "Dicoy" or appellant from Violeta.<br><br>Worth mentioning is the fact that the testimonies of all prosecution and defense witnesses were heard by Judge Maximo M. Japzon but the decision was penned by Judge Fortunato B. Cuna who heard only the testimonies of rebuttal witnesses for the prosecution presented for the sole purpose of denying the literacy of Violeta. Be it noted also that the Office of the Solicitor General in its Manifestation and Motion in lieu of Appellee's brief, recommends the acquittal of the accused.<br><br>Hence, the need for a painstaking review on appeal of the testimonies of the witnesses particularly those of the alleged eyewitnesses Conrado and Lolita Ponsil.<br><br>Judge Cuna should have carefully considered every angle including the enlightening observations of his predecessor who had every opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses in order to arrive at the truth.<br><br>In the case at bar, no serious evaluation was accorded the indifference of spouses Conrado and Lolita Ponsil and Pat. Montanejos in looking for Violeta Ponsil in the light of the claim that she was kidnapped by appellant. On cross-examination, Conrado Ponsil testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">"Q </td><td width="95%">You did not go to the house or the residence of Federico Espina?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td> I did not.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td>From the time you waited until Federico Espina was arrested, you could see him in Bo.

(tsn, pp. 8-9, Sept. 7, 1983) (pp. 8-9, Brief for Appellee). Lolita's testimony has raised more doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.

(tsn, p. 33-37, 40-41, Sept. 29, 1983) (pp. 9-12. Brief for Appellee) The testimony of Pat. Benjamin Montanejos reveals that he himself seriously doubted the kidnapping story; hence, his lack of interest in looking for Violeta. On direct examination, he testified as follows:</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Q </td><td><div align="justify">Will you open the police blotter for the entry in December 1982 (Witness opening the police blotter for December 1982, in which is found on page 167 a portion of the entry.

(tsn, pp. 16-18, Sept. 29, 1983) (pp. 12-14, Brief for Appellee)</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>Certainly, such indifference of the witnesses as shown by their aforequoted testimonies is contrary to human experience. Conrado and Lolita Ponsil, the parents of the alleged kidnapped victim Violeta, who were supposed to be most interested in finding their daughter should have lost no time in causing the arrest of appellant and in asking him as to the whereabouts of Violeta. Yet, the testimonies show that the alleged kidnapping was reported to the police only two (2) days later for no apparent reason; that no effort was made to check the places where Violeta was reportedly taken; that appellant, while he was incarcerated, was not asked as to the whereabouts of Violeta. If spouses Conrado and Lolita Ponsil were so certain in their testimonies that appellant took away their daughter at gunpoint from their house on December 4, 1982, why was appellant arrested only more than 3 weeks after the alleged kidnapping had been noted in the police blotter?<br><br>We now take into consideration Exh. "1" (and "1-A")*** which is a letter supposedly written by Violeta to the appellant, supporting the view that Violeta was not forcibly taken from her house. Said letter is consistent with the statement of appellant that he proposed to live with Violeta, to wit:<br><blockquote>"To you Dicoy,<br><br>I have this letter for you since we do not have a chance to talk because I am always watched by my mother. That's why I have just written you as you will know my decision on when I shall go with you. Get me on Saturday evening because we have a Novena Feast in the day, Mother and all will be drunk, be sure Dicoy so that I will be at peace. Never mind the fact that we are relatives, anyway we are not the only ones in such situation Dicoy — because I love. Get me on Saturday night I shall wait for you that night.<br><br>That's all. One who loves you.<br><br>Violeta. Dicoy,<br>I love you."</blockquote>Premises considered, the prosecution has failed to establish beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of appellant. Accordingly heis acquitted of the crime charged and is ordered released immediately.
