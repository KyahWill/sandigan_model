				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> <span style="">seeks </span>to annul the orders of the
respondent lower court dismissing the appeal interposed by the Director of
Lands in a land registration case on the ground of nonperfection thereof for
failure to file a record on appeal; and consequently to have the court a quo

<p class="BODY">The lower court, in a decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> dated
July 21, 1981, ordered the issuance of a decree of registration of title over a
27-hectare land in Siniloan, Laguna in favor of the applicants, spouses
Francisco K. Redor<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

copy of the decision was received by the Solicitor General for the <span style="">oppositor Director of Lands on September 29,
1981 and thereafter, </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">he filed a notice of
appeal dated October 12, 1981.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1">The applicants filed a motion to
dismiss the appeal for </span><span style="">being </span><b style="">pro forma</b><span style=""> </span><span style="">inasmuch as </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">oppositor</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Director of Lands did </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">not introduce any evidence during the trial.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1">In compliance with an order of the
court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"> the Director of </span>Lands filed an opposition to said
motion to dismiss the appeal.  He
contended that the ruling cited by the applicants to the effect that a party
who did not introduce evidence during the trial has no right to appeal the
decision, was applicable only to an ordinary civil case.  <span style="">He </span>averred
that it was not necessary for him to adduce evidence in support of his
opposition because the burden of proof to establish their title was on the <span style="">appli</span><span class="CharacterStyle1">cants
and should they fail to do so, the land would remain part </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">public </span><span style="">domain.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On January </span>14, <span style="">1982, the lower court </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">denied the motion to dismiss the appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The applicants then moved to set aside the order of January 14,
1982 asserting <span style="">that </span>their right <span style="">to </span>due process was violated <span style="">by such denial order as it was made without
trial on the merits </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">of their motion to
dismiss.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The incident was therefore heard by the court.  The applicants explained therein that they
failed to appear at the hearing of the motion to dismiss the appeal because
their counsel <span style="">(appli</span>cant Redor
himself) was then out of the country.  The court found the explanation to be well-taken but, inasmuch as the
motion to set aside the order denying the motion to dismiss did not raise <span style="">any new matters, it denied said motion on
June 18, </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">1982.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Four years later, or on June 26, 1986, the Solicitor General
received a copy of the applicants' motion for execution of the July 21, 1981
decision on the ground that the appeal of the Director of Lands had not been
perfected pursuant to Section 23 of the Interim Rules of Court which states
that "(i)n cases where appeal is taken, the perfection of the appeal shall
be upon the <span class="CharacterStyle1">expiration of the last day to appeal by
any party."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While noting that the notice of appeal was filed within the
30-day reglementary period and that no appeal bond was necessary <span style="">as the Director of Lands was exempted from
posting the same, the </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">lower court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"> in its order of August 15, 1986, nonetheless dismissed
the appeal on the ground that it was "never perfected" because the
Director of Lands failed to file the record on appeal required by Rule 41 of
the Rules of Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General filed a motion for the reconsideration of
said order arguing that no record on appeal is required under Section 39 of
Batas Pambansa Blg. 129; that although the reorgan­ization of the courts was
implemented only on July 17, 1983 by the appointment of judges through
Executive Order No. 864, said Section 39 took effect upon the approval of B.P.
Blg. 129 on August 14, 1981 because Section 48 thereof provides for its
immediate effectivity; and that, since Section 39 does not re<span class="CharacterStyle1">quire a record on appeal, the Director of Lands perfected
the appeal when he filed his notice of appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General's motion for reconsideration having been
denied for lack of merit on September 26, 1986, he interposed the instant
petition for the Director of Lands.  The
petit<span class="CharacterStyle1">ioner contends that:  (a) the lower court acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or
with grave abuse of discretion in </span><span style="">dismissing
his appeal despite the timely filing </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">October 12, 1981 of
the notice of appeal because under Section 39 of B.P. Blg. 129, a record of
appeal is no longer required, and (b) since his appeal had been perfected, the
lower court unlawfully neglected to perform its clear duty to give due course
to the appeal when it issued the orders of August 15, 1986 and September 26,
1986 dismissing the appeal.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle1">In their comment on the petition,
private respondents argue </span>that no appeal was perfected by the petitioner
either under B.P. <span style="">Blg. 129 or
Presidential Decree No. 1529.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> While they admit that </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">Section 39 of B.P. 129 is controlling in this case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"> private </span><span style="">respondents
contend that the notice of appeal was filed beyond the 15-day period provided
for by said section because the notice was filed </span><span style="">only </span><span style="">on October 21, 1981
or twenty-two (22) days after the Solicitor General had received a copy of the
decision on September 12, 1981.  On the
other hand, private respondents argue should P.D. No. 1529 be made applicable
in this case, still the Solicitor General failed to file a record on appeal
even if the notice of appeal was filed within the 30-day period stated in </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">Section 30 of P.D. No. 1529.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his reply to said comment, the petitioner avers that the n<span class="CharacterStyle1">otice of appeal was actually sent by registered mail on
October </span>13, 1981 as evidenced by a copy of the registry receipt showing
that the letter addressed to the clerk of court of the then Court <span style="">of First Instance in Sta. Cruz, Laguna (Item
No. 2275) was mailed </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">at the Ermita Pilot
Post Office.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"> Hence, the petitioner argues, </span><span style="">the notice was filed within the reglementary
period of fifteen (15) days set by Section 39 of B. P. Blg. 129 inasmuch as a
copy of the decision was received by the Office of the Solicitor General on
September 29, 1981.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Traversing the factual issue of the timeliness of the filing <span class="CharacterStyle1">of the notice of appeal, private respondents filed a
rejoinder to </span><span style="">the petitioner's
reply to which a copy of the letter of the </span><span class="CharacterStyle1">Postmaster
of Sta. Cruz, Laguna is attached.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span class="CharacterStyle1"> Said letter states </span><span style="">that registered letter No. 2275 sent by the Office of the Solicitor
General in Manila was received by the post office in Sta. Cruz, Laguna on
October 20, 1981 and delivered to the clerk of court of the then Court of First
Instance in Sta. Cruz on October 21, 1981.  Also attached to the rejoinder is another letter sent by the branch
clerk of court of Branch 27 of the Regional Trial Court in Sta. Cruz to the
private respondents' counsel informing him that the docket of the court does
not reflect the manner in which the notice of appeal was filed and neither can
an envelop indicating when it was mailed, be found.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court takes judicial notice of the fact that for reasons of
economy and expediency, the Solicitor General avails himself of the postal
service in sending notices and pleadings to places outside the Metro Manila
area.  More so in this case where there
is proof that the notice of appeal was sent by registered mail on October 13,
1981.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question that needs the attention of the Court is wheth­er an
appeal has been perfected by petitioner by the mere filing of a notice of
appeal.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue has been discussed in <b>Alday vs. Camilon</b><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the Court held that the provisions of B.P. Blg. 129 on appeals have
retroactive effect.  Thus, although
under Section 44 of said law its provisions "shall be carried out in
accordance with an Executive Order to be issued by the President" and for
which Executive Order No. 864 abolishing all courts and declaring the <span style="">completion of the reorganization of the
judiciary was issued only on January 17, 1983, the effectivity of the
procedural provisions of B.P. Blg. 129 took effect upon its approval on August
14, 1981.  Consequently, a record on
appeal was no longer required to perfect his appeal when the petitioner herein
filed the notice of appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the decision subject of the appeal involves a land
registration case does not affect the petitioner's claim for the law's
beneficial effects.  The requirements
for the perfec­tion of an appeal in an ordinary case apply in the same manner
and with equal force and effect to appeals from a decision in a <span style="">land registration case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the perfection of an appeal is to be reckoned not from the
filing of the notice of appeal but from the payment of­ docket fees,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner may be deemed to have perfected his appeal by the mere filing of the
notice of appeal on October 12, 1981 or on the 13th day of the 15-day
reglementary period because under Section 16 of Rule 141 of the Rules of Court,
he is exempt<span style="">ed from paying the </span><span style="">legal </span><span style="">fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the orders of August 15, 1986 and September 26,
1986 are hereby reversed and set aside.  The lower court is ordered to give due course to the appeal and to
elevate the entire records of LRC Case No. N-107 to the Court of Appeals <span style="">for </span>deter<span style="">mination and disposition of petitioner's appeal on the merits.  This decision is immediately executory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
