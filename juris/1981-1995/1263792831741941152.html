prohibition is the validity of the acts of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government (hereafter, simply PCGG) in authorizing and directing the sale to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Management Corporation of
sequestered shares of stock in accordance with a contract which petitioners
contend had already been rescinded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is petitioners' thesis that those acts were done without or in excess of the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> authority or with grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">res</i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>involved consists of 16,237,339
shares of stock of <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Corporation (Common Class
A), of which the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">registered owners</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>are the petitioners, Palm Avenue
Realty Development Corporation and Palm Avenue Holdings Co., Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The shares had been pledged by the
petitioners with three (3) institutions as security for loans obtained from the
latter, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Philippine Commercial
and International Bank (PCIB), Philippine Commercial Capital (PCC), and
Equitable Bank.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG sequestered these shares on or about <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It did so, apparently on the strength of
evidence that the ostensible owners, herein petitioner corporations, were owned
and controlled by a known "crony" of former President Marcos,
Benjamin <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Kokoy</span></i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span><span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
At that time, the loans were all past due and auction sale of the pledged stock
was imminent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Management Corporation
(hereafter, simply BENGUET) wished to acquire these shares of stock from the
petitioners, intending to distribute them chiefly to the employees of <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> Corporation and its subsidiaries pursuant to a plan
named Employees' Stock Ownership and Incentive Plan, or ESOIP. BENGUET opened
negotiations with the petitioners for the purchase of the stock.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It found the petitioners to be willing sellers,
but only of so much of the stock as was needed to be sold to pay the past due
loans secured, as aforesaid, by the pledge of all said stock.</p>

<p class="BODY">The negotiations culminated in the execution by the parties of a
Contract to Purchase and Sell dated <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="9">September
 1, 1986</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Its principal stipulations were the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. BENGUET would buy as much of the petitioners' stock as was
needed to pay the latter's loans,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
estimated to be 9.5 million shares.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The price was fixed at P29.00 per share, expected to be
realized at a "cross sale" thru Papa Securities at the <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
or <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Stock Exchange.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Additionally, (a) the written approval of the PCGG had to be
obtained; (2) the purchasers were to procure the release of all stock from the <span class="SpellE">pledgee</span> banks; and (3) if this was not done within 60 days,
BENGUET had the option either to withdraw from the contract, by notice in
writing, or pay interest as provided in the agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Approval by the PCGG was not immediately given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a communication dated September 23, 1986
it opined that the price was too low, P43.00 per share being in its view the
more adequate, and set down other conditions at variance with the stipulations
in the contract of purchase and sale.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> Both
parties found the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> terms quite unacceptable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eventually, however, due mainly to the efforts and representations
of BENGUET, PCGG gave its approval.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By
letter dated <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1986</st1:date>,
signed by Commissioner Ramon Diaz, PCGG advised BENGUET that at its meeting on
that same day it had approved the Contract to Purchase and Sell dated <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1986</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners protested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In their view, the contract had already been rescinded, and they had
been freed from their commitments <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, because
(1) the contract had been earlier disapproved by the PCGG, (2) and it had
moreover been abandoned by BENGUET, which had opted to negotiate directly with
the PCGG for the acquisition of the shares in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also alleged that they had since made
their own arrangements with the <span class="SpellE">pledgee</span> banks for the
release of the pledged stock upon payment of the obligations thereby
secured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, they deemed it
grossly unfair for the stock to be sold at P29.00 per share when the market
price had already risen to P56.00 to P58.00 a share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners made known their objections
to all parties concerned, including the broker, Papa Securities; the stock
exchanges; the creditors-<span class="SpellE">pledgees</span>; the Securities and
Exchange Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3</span></span></a> BENGUET
disagreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It pointed out that the
action of the PCGG reflected in its letter of September 23, 1986 was not final;
in fact the PCGG had, at <span class="SpellE">BENGUET's</span> instance, later
reconsidered that action and given its approval on October 14, 1986 to the
Contract to Purchase and Sell of September 1, 1986, well within the 60-day
deadline fixed by the parties; and the contract could not be unilaterally cancelled
or modified, e.g., as to the price stipulated for the shares of stock, the rise
or fall of the stock prices in the stock market being at the risk of the
parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1986</st1:date>,
the PCGG and BENGUET, drew up and signed a Memorandum of Agreement specifying
the terms and conditions under which the Contract to Purchase and Sell of <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1986</st1:date> would be
implemented.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

bulk of which would be paid to PCIB, PCC and Equitable Bank to extinguish their
credits and bring about the release of all said 16,237,339 pledged shares).</p>

<p class="BODY">2. 3 million out of the 9.5 million shares would be sold to the
employees of BENGUET and its subsidiaries in accordance with the Employees'
Ownership &amp; Incentive Plan already referred to, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

rest of the purchased stock, numbering 6.5 million shares, would be warehoused,
or held in trust for PCGG by BENGUET, to be sold when and as directed by the
former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When sold, the proceeds of the
sale of these 6.5 million shares would be delivered to the PCGG minus their
acquisition cost (to BENGUET) of P29.00 per share (or P188,500,000.00).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">However, the restraining order failed to prevent the consummation

<p class="BODY">Be this as it may, seven (7) days after they brought suit in the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> RTC, the petitioners filed with this Court on

the special block sale of the 9.5 million shares and the release of all the

and directed the carrying out of the Contract to Purchase and Sell of September
1, 1986 despite their objections, and despite the fact that the stock could have
been sold for a much higher price.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that as <span class="SpellE">sequestrator</span>,
the PCGG was obliged to preserve the stock that it had seized, and prevent its
loss, disappearance, depreciation or deterioration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can there be any question that it was in the interest of
all concerned -- including the Government, in the event that the stock be
judicially declared to be "ill-gotten wealth" and awarded to it; or
the ostensible owners, in the event that they succeed in vindicating their title
to the property -- to prevent if at all possible the auction sale of the shares
of stock in satisfaction of the obligations to secure which they had been
pledged, given the universally accepted reality that such auction sales seldom
fetch a fair or adequate price.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a> This is
what the PCGG tried to do in this case, with no little success.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paradoxically, by authorizing the sale of 9.5 million shares of
the stock in question at a price of P29.00 per share, much lower than the
prevailing market price at the time -- then ranging from P56 to P58 per share, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">supra</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

the future sale of some other portion of the stock -- for the benefit of the
party which may eventually be adjudged by competent authority to be the owner
of the stock in question, whether it be the Government or the petitioners, or
some other person -- and at the same time, respect a perfected and existing
contract and make possible the attainment by BENGUET of the benefits provided

the stock in trust, as <span class="SpellE">sequestrator</span> and conservator

to the seller’ ownership was, to repeat, only a block of 3 million shares out
of the 16,237,339 sequestered shares. Title to the rest was not at all
affected, and possession thereof remained in the PCGG for disposition in
accordance with law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>6.5 million shares
could be sold at any time deemed most appropriate, and under conditions deemed
most favorable, by the PCGG, the proceeds also to come within its legal custody
and also to be disposed of in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may well be that some other scheme better than that involved
in this case might have been conceived and entered into with some other
party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not at all certain,
considering the no small outlay required, and the fact that not too many
persons could be expected to be interested in acquiring such a big block of
stock The stark reality is that the PCGG did not have time to sit and wait, or
shop around, for such a better arrangement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners had not themselves come up with anything more concrete
than claims of access to some funding, or of efforts to come to some accord
with their creditors which, however, needed approval of the PCGG in any case,
as petitioners themselves acknowledge.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> On the
other hand the threat of the auction sale of the pledged stock because the
obligations thereby secured were long past due and unpaid, was actual and
imminent, and could not be ignored.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Interest on these obligations was and had been piling up at the rate of
P185,000.00 a day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a> Moreover,
the PCGG could not close its eyes to the actuality of the perfected Contract to
Purchase and Sell executed on September 1, 1986 by and between the petitioners
and BENGUET, and to the fact that the petitioners' claim -- that they had the
right to rescind as they had actually rescinded the contract in view of the
failure of BENGUET to obtain the approval thereof by the PCGG within 60 days --
is confuted by the <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> circumstance that the
PCGG did in truth give that approval within 60 days, and the added circumstance
that paragraph 2 of the contract, invoked by the petitioners, does not really
provide for rescission at all, but merely grants to BENGUET the option either
of withdrawing from the contract by notice in writing, or bearing "the
interest expense for the loans secured by the shares of stock ** beginning on
the sixty-first (61st) day from the date of ** (the) Agreement."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was no doubt in the light of these undeniable actualities, and
in an attempt to discharge its responsibility to preserve the sequestered stock
and put an end to its continuing and inexorable depreciation, that the PCGG
performed the acts now subject of attack in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon these facts and considerations, it
cannot be said that the PCGG acted beyond the scope of the power conferred upon
it by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it would appear that
its acts were motivated and guided by the law creating it and prescribing its
powers, functions, duties and responsibilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither can it be said that it acted with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It evidently considered and
assessed the facts, the conflicting positions of the parties concerned, and the
options open to it, before taking the course of action that it did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The possibility that it has erred cannot, to
be sure, be completely eliminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
above stated, it is entirely possible that a better bargain might have been
struck with someone else.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What cannot be
denied is that the arrangement actually adopted and implemented has resulted in
the satisfactory reconciliation of the conflicting factors in the case and the
preservation of the stock for the benefit of the party that may finally be
adjudged by competent court to be the owner thereof, and to a certain extent,
to the advantage of numerous employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners have failed to demonstrate that respondent PCGG
has acted without or in excess of the authority granted to it by law, or with
grave abuse of discretion, or that it had exercised judicial or quasi-judicial
functions in this case, correctible by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

by the petitioners of the instant special civil action for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

prohibition in this Court despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
their action in the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Regional Trial Court, is a
species of forum-shopping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both actions
unquestionably involve the same transactions, the same essential facts and
circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners' claim of
absence of identity simply because the PCGG had not been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
in the RTC suit, and the suit did not involve certain acts which transpired
after its commencement, is specious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the RTC action, as in the action before this Court, the validity of the
contract to purchase and sell of September 1, 1986, i.e., whether or not it had
been efficaciously rescinded, and the propriety of implementing the same (by
paying the <span class="SpellE">pledgee</span> banks the amount of their loans,
obtaining the release of the pledged shares, etc.) were the basic issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, too, the relief was the same:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the prevention of such implementation and/or
the restoration of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">status quo ante</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>When the acts sought to be restrained
took place anyway despite the issuance by the Trial Court of a temporary
restraining order, the RTC suit did not become <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">functus</span></i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">

effective vehicle for <span class="SpellE">obtention</span> of relief; and
petitioners' remedy in the premises was plain and patent: the filing of an
amended and supplemental pleading in the RTC suit, so as to include the PCGG as
defendant and seek nullification of the acts sought to be enjoined but
nonetheless done.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remedy was
certainly not the institution of another action in another forum based on
essentially the same facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The adoption
of this latter recourse renders the petitioners amenable to disciplinary action
and both their actions, in this Court as well as in the Court <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a
