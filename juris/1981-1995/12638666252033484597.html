6715.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The labor arbiter did not act on the
motion and forwarded the records to the respondent NLRC before which the case

<p class="BODY">Petitioner cites Section 12 of Republic Act No. 6715 which reads
as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"SEC. 12.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 223
of the same Code is amended to read as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"ART. 223.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Appeal</u>.

unless appealed to the Commission by any or both parties within ten (10)

award in the judgment appealed from. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing provision of the law, petitioner
alleges that because of the failure of private respondent to post a bond the
decision has become final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that a motion for reconsideration cannot be
filed with the respondent labor arbiter as the latter merely failed to resolve
the motion for execution and sent the records of the case to respondent
NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further contends that
he cannot seek a reconsideration from respondent NLRC as it has no jurisdiction
over the appeal private respondent having failed to perfect its appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner asserts that it is the ministerial
duty of the respondent NLRC to remand the records and for the respondent labor
arbiter to execute his decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proper step that the petitioner should have taken was to file
a motion to dismiss appeal and to remand the records with the respondent NLRC
alleging therein that the decision had become final and executory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not true that respondent NLRC has no
jurisdiction to act on this case at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has the authority to dismiss the appeal if it is shown that the
appeal has not been duly perfected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is only when the respondent NLRC denies such motion and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the denial appears to be unlawful that this petition for <i><u>mandamus</u></i>
should be filed in this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">3, </span>Rule
65 of the Rules of Court, it is provided:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

tribunal, corporation, board, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of
an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station, or unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of
a right or office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person
aggrieved<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>thereby may file a verified
petition in the proper court alleging the facts with certainty and praying that
judgment be rendered commanding the defendant, immediately or at some other
specified time, to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the
petitioner, and to pay the damages<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>sustained by the petitioner by reason of the<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>wrongful acts of the defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In this case it has not
been shown that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">either </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the respondent labor arbiter or respondent
NLRC has unlawfully neglected the performance of an act which the law
specifically enjoins them as a duty to perform or has otherwise unlawfully
excluded petitioner from a right he is entitled to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of the respondent labor arbiter,
he has not denied the motion for execution filed by the </span>petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He merely did not act on the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">had
petitioner urged the immediate resolution of his motion far execution </span>by

11.0pt">of the respondent NLRC, it was not even given the opportunity to pass
upon the question raised by petitioner as to whether or not it has jurisdiction
over the appeal, so the records of the case can be remanded to the respondent
labor arbiter for execution of the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Obviously, petitioner had
a plain, speedy and adequate remedy to seek relief from public respondents but
he failed to avail himself of the same before coming to this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To say the least, the petition is premature
