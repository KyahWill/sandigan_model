that a Presidential Decree<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
was issued by way of response to the ravages of world-wide inflation, causing
extreme difficulty to laborers and wage-earners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All employers are hereby required to pay all
their employees receiving a basic salary of not more than P1,000 a month,
regardless of the nature of their employment, a 13th-month pay not later than
December 24 of every year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Employers already paying their employees a
13th-month pay or its equivalent are not covered by this Decree Sec. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Decree shall take effect

Relying on the above Decree, private respondent Marcopper Employees Labor Union
filed a complaint before the National Labor Relations Commission for the
payment of the 13th-month salary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Marcopper Mining Corporation opposed on the ground that in view
of its then existing collective bargaining agreement adopted on October 8, 1977
which granted the employees belonging to private respondent mid­year and
year-end bonuses, it was exempt from the ope­ration of such Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its opposition prevailed with a regional
director, who, on March 29, 1979, dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, then Deputy Minister of Labor,
respondent Amado G. Inciong, on July 25, 1979, reversed such order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He explicitly stated that the bonuses under
the collective bargaining agreement are "by their very nature of a different
character from the 13th month pay ordained by the Decree." He went on to
say:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Foremost to consider and in
point is, Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing PD No. 851 which
deals on prohibition against reduction or elimination of the benefits provided
by the Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said section provides as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Nothing herein shall be
construed to authorize any employer to eliminate, or diminish in any way,
supplements, or other employee benefits or favorable practice being enjoyed by
the employee at the time of the promulgation of this issuance.' Both the
mid-year and year-end bonuses are benefits being enjoyed by complainants at the
time of the promulgation of PD 851, hence, covered by the foregoing
prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, said benefits were
negotiated and re-incorporated in subsequent collective bargaining agreement
which gives them a character separate and distinct from the 13th month
pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason of the collective
bargaining agreement, complainants acquired a vested right over such benefits
on a mutual and contractual understanding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any subsequent grant of benefit, extended by law, will not operate to
disturb the existing agreement and to construe otherwise will result to the
prejudice of the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If we must
consider deeper the grant of the bonuses, we will find that it is a voluntary
gesture on the part of the respondent irrespective of the amount of salary of
the employees and does not form part of their pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise conditional in that the same
could be availed of only when profit in business has been realized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once profit is declared, then bonuses must be
automatically granted in the amount to be determined by the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the grant of 13th month
pay to employees is mandatory, irrespective of loss or profit by the
company."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was alleged that there was a grave abuse of discretion as under the term of the
Decree, in relation to a section cited,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner is excluded from its coverage and that there was lack of
jurisdiction of respondent Inciong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the answer of public respondents submitted by Solicitor General Estelito
Mendoza,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the above contentions were characterized as devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference was made to the inability of
petitioner to demonstrate that it clearly falls under the exempting clause of
the above Decree, citing not only the section of the implementing rules and
regulations relied upon by petitioner, but a later section <span style="">which </span>reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Nothing herein shall be construed to
authorize any employer to eliminate or diminish in any way, supplements, or
other employee benefits or favorable practice being enjoyed by the employee at
the time of promulgation of this issuance."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The answer discussed the matter further thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In the case at bar, the payment of the mid-year and Christmas
bonuses in those years when petitioner's operation is profitable is a matter of
contractual obligation on the part of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the CBA clearly
states that petitioner 'shall grant mid-year and end-year bonuses to employees
following years in which it had profitable operations.’ The only thing that is
left to the discretion of petitioner is the amount of such mid-year and
end-year bonuses; but there is no question that petitioner has to grant such
bonuses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since said bonuses granted <span style="">in</span> fulfillment of petitioner's
contractual obligations under the CBA are employee benefits enjoyed by
petitioner's employees at the time PD 851 took effect and since the payment of
such bonuses is obligatory on the part of petitioner, the petitioner does not
come under the exempting clause of PD 851 and it has to pay its employees the
13th month pay required under said Decree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, all employee monetary benefits provided in the CBA are
in addition to, and may not be taken as substitute for, the employee benefits
granted by law, otherwise there would be no reason for the execution of the
CBA."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a conclusion is unavoidable in the light of the mandatory language
of the Presidential Decree, the conditional character of the contractual
obligation under the collective bargaining agreement, and on the construction
that should be fastened on statutes or decrees intended to promote social and
economic rights.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The Decree is specific and mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Employers, without exception, are required to
pay their employees receiving a basic salary of not more than P1,000 a month
irrespective of the nature of employment, a 13th-month pay not later than
December 24 of every year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the
plain and specific command.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is an
obligation imposed by law and must be obeyed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where the employers, however, actually grant such for the 13th-month
pay, they could be exempted from the operation of the Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To fall within the exempting clause, it must
be shown that there is such actual payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no such showing here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, reliance of petitioner corporation is on a clause in the
existing bargaining contract which in its opinion amounts to the fulfillment of
its duty under the Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The memorandum
of Solicitor General Mendoza makes clear why such a submission is
unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the case at bar, the payment of
mid-year and Christmas bonuses in the years when petitioner's operation is
profitable is a matter of contractual obligation on the part of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only thing that is left
to the discretion of petitioner is the amount of such mid-year and end-year
bonuses; but there is no question that petitioner has to grant such bonuses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since said bonuses granted in fulfill­ment of
petitioner's contractual obligations under the CBA are employee benefits
enjoyed by petitioner's employees at the time PD No. 851 took effect and since
the payment of such bonuses is obligatory on the part of the petitioner, then
the petitioner does not come under the exempting clause of PD No. 851 and it
has to pay its employees the 13th month pay required under said Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if the company earns no
profit in a particular year, then it is not obligated, under the CBA, to grant
bonuses to its employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it grants
bonuses notwithstanding the fact that it is not in profitable operation, the
grant thereof is a purely voluntary gesture on the part of the company, and the
company is then entitled to credit the same as the 13th month salary under the
Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, all employee
monetary benefits provided in the CBA are in addition to, and may not be taken
as substitute for, the employee benefits granted by law, otherwise there would
be no reason for the execution of the CBA."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The Solicitor General then went on to state that a bonus under the collective
bargaining agreement and the 13th-month pay are of different category.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while the former is an obligation created
by contract, the other is created by law; while the former is contractual in
character, only if there are profits, the latter is absolute and mandatory on
the part of the employer; while the former benefits only those earning P1,000
or less a month, the latter applies to all rank and file workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear, therefore, that a 13th-month pay
is in the nature of wages while the bonuses provided for are mere supplements
or fringe benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further the
memorandum continues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The 13th
month pay is, by its nature and purpose, part of wages, considering the express
recitals in PD No. 851 that 'it is necessary to protect the level of real wages
from the ravage of world-wide inflation' and 'there has been no increase in the
legal minimum wage rates since 1970' * * * CBA bonuses and benefits are not
part of wages but merely supplements or fringe benefits."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
On the authority of Atok-Big Wedge Association v. Atok-Big Wedge Co.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
it is contended, and correctly, by the Solicitor General that clearly "the
bonuses and other benefits granted to the employees by the petitioner under the
current CBA are 'supplements' and do not form part of wages."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->There is no vagueness in the Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the most, there could be ambiguity by the
use of the word "equivalent" in Section 2 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were <span style="">a </span>13th-month pay, then obviously petitioner is entitled to be
exempted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it is understandable why
it made much of Section 3 of the implementing rules and regulations, referring,
as already noted, to a Christmas bonus as well as a mid-year bonus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would be, though, as was pointed out by
the Solicitor General, to ignore an even clearer provision in the implementing
rules, namely Section 10 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Nothing herein shall
be construed to authorize any employer to eliminate or diminish in any way,
supplements, or other employee benefits or favorable practice being enjoyed by
the employee at the time of promulgation of this issuance."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The purpose that animated the Decree is thus rendered even clearer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was issued in the expectation that
"whatever employee benefits or favorable practice being enjoyed by the
employee" when it was promulgated should not be eliminated or
diminished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were otherwise, it
would lose its character as a measure intended to cope with the problems that
the low salaried employees face in view of the inflationary state of the
economy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The situation, instead of
improving, has grown worse the past six years, the Decree being issued in
1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be, therefore, to defeat
the purpose of the Decree if the contention urged by petitioner would be
sustained.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion reached by
the Court receives an even more compelling justification from the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1935 Constitution
enshrined the concepts of social justice<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

Even then, there w<span style="">as a realization of
their importance in vitalizing a regime of liberty not just as immunity from
governmental restraint but as the assumption by the State of an obligation to
assure a life of dignity for all, especially the poor and the needy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The expanded social justice</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and protection to labor provisions</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of the present Constitution lend added
emphasis to the concern for social and economic rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The memorandum of the Solicitor General
quoted this excerpt from La Mallorca v. Workmen's Compensation Commission:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "A decisive consideration, much more compelling
in character</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">precludes acceptance of the view now pressed
by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and time again, we
have stressed that statutes intended to benefit labor should be accorded the
most hospitable scope to attain their dominant purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby fidelity is manifested to the
constitutional policy embodied in the principle of social justice and the
mandate of protection to labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
cannot be made to yield a meaning that would emasculate their terms or allow evasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To do so could even give rise to serious
constitutional questions, for the legislative body would then be deemed to have
enacted measures which, rather than translate into reality such worthy
constitutional objective, would frustrate it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an approach certainly cannot find any favor with courts, if the
oft-repeated doctrine that no interpretation is allowable that would bring
doubts as to the validity of any statutory provision for repugnancy to the
funda­mental law were to be, as it should be, respected."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>That was so under the 1935
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an approach is even
more valid now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in
the first case after the applicability of the 1973 Constitution where social
and economic rights were involved, this Court in Alfanta v. <span style="">Noe,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
through Justice Antonio, stated:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"In the environment of a new social order We can do <span style="">no </span>less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, under the new Constitution, property
ownership has been impressed with a social function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This implies that the owner has the
obligation to use his property not only to benefit himself but society as
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it provides under Section 6
of Article II thereof, that in the promotion of social justice, the State
'shall regulate the acquisition, ownership, use, enjoyment, and dispo­sition of
private property, and equitably diffuse property ownership and profits.' The
Constitution also ensures that the worker shall have a just and living wage
which should assure for himself and his family <span style="">an </span>existence worthy of human dignity and give him opportunities
for a better life."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a sentiment finds expression in subsequent opinions.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second point raised
in the petition is the allegation that respondent Deputy Minister was without
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention on its
face clearly lacks support in law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
far back as Philippine American Management &amp; Financing Co., Inc. v.

decided in 1972, this Court left no doubt as to the labor tribunal, then the
Court of Industrial Relations, being vested with competence to pass upon a
declaratory relief petition for the interpretation of a collective bargaining
agree­ment, not a Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no justi­fication for a departure from the principle which was
announced in the light of a careful study of previous decisions and precisely
enunciated to settle all doubts on the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
The allegation that this is a money claim falsifies reality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is involved here and what persuaded this
Court to give due course to this petition is that a serious question of the
appli­cability of Presidential Decree No. 851 was raised in the light of the
stipulation in the collective bargain­ing contract between petitioner and
respondent union as to the mid-year and Christmas bonus.</p>
