<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner bank moved
to reconsider the decision of the lower court.  On December 28, 1984, the respondent judge denied the said motion for
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 24, 1985, petitioner filed its notice of appeal with
the respondent court.  The latter denied
the petitioner's appeal on February 20, 1985 and ordered the issuance of the
writ of execution for the enforcement of the summary judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 26, 1985, the petitioner filed with the then
Intermediate Appellate Court (IAC), now Court of Appeals (CA), a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> (A.C.-G.R. 05529) to set aside the orders of
respondent trial judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 26, 1985, the appellate court dismissed the petition for
lack of merit.  The case was thereafter
elevated to this court thru a petition for review (G.R. 70482), which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">We </span>denied in a resolution dated May 8,
1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank issued M.B.
Resolution No. 364 dated April 25, 1985, thereby placing Philippine Veterans
Bank under receivership pursuant to Section 29 of R.A. No. 265, as amended,
otherwise known as The Central Bank Act (See pp. 139 and 264, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Rollo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">O</span>n May 15, 1985,
private respondent Emiliana Doblon filed an ex-parte motion for alias writ of
execution which was opposed by the petitioner bank on the ground that the
latter is under receivership and that all claims against it cannot be enforced
until after liquidation.  On the same
date, the respondent judge granted the said motion for the writ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 7, 1985, the Monetary Board of the Central <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bank </span>issued a report on the
receivership of Philippine Veterans Bank as of May 31, 1985, and confirmed that
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the latter </span>can no longer resume
business with safety to its depositors, creditors and the general public.  It also ordered the liquidation of PVB
pursuant to Section 29 of R.A. No. 265, as amended, in accordance with the liquidation
plan and rules and regulations approved under Resolution No. 364 dated April
25, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 8 and 9, 1985, the deputy Sheriff proceeded to conduct
the sales at public auction of the real properties of petitioner PVB pursuant
to the order of alias writ of execution issued by the respondent judge on May
15, 1985.  Corresponding certificates of
sale were issued to the highest bidders at said auction sales.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 10, 1985, petitioner PVB filed with the Intermediate
Appellate Court a petition for prohibition, <i>mandamus</i> and <i>certiorari</i>
(AC-G.R. SP No. 06558) to nullify and set aside the sales at public auction of
petitioner's properties conducted by respondent deputy sheriff on July 8 and 9,
1985 and to enjoin the respondent judge from taking cognizance of or taking any
future action in Civil Case No. 84-23585.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the Central Bank filed with the Regional Trial
Court of Manila, a petition for assistance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in </span>the liquidation of the Philippine Veterans Bank.  On September 4, 1986, private respondent
Emiliana Doblon filed a motion for payment or satisfaction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>deficiency judgment.  Acting on the motion, the liquidation court
ordered Doblon to submit her claim with the committee on claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 6, 1985, the trial court approved and granted the
petition of the Central Bank for assistance in the liquidation of petitioner
and ordered all claimants on September 17, 1985 to file their claims with the
Liquidator Antonio Castro of the Supervision and Examination Sector of the
Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 6, 1985, the respondent Intermediate Appellate Court
in AC-G.R. SP No. 06558 rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.  The restraining order previously issued is lifted,
dissolved and set aside.  Quadruple
costs against petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED" (p. 157, <u>Rollo</u>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the
aforementioned decision.  On December 5,
1985, the respondent appellate court denied the said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition was filed on January 28, 1986, to
review and reverse the decisions of the respondent appellate court in not
setting aside the public sales of petitionerâ€™s properties conducted by
respondent sheriff on July 8 and 9, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not the judgment of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila in Civil Case No. 84-23585 which awarded damages
to private respondent Emiliana Doblon, can be legally enforced against
petitioner by execution, after petitioner has been placed under liquidation by
the Monetary Board of the Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the final judgment in Civil Case No.
84-23585 must be satisfied in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">liquidation
proceedings considering that the assets of petitioners are already in <u>custodia</u>
<u>legis</u> of the liquidator, and that the sales at public auction conducted </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the respondent sheriff to enforce the writ of execution issued by
respondent judge are illegal and void.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The respondent appellate
court, in its decision, stated, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A review of the facts of this case reveals that the judgment
rendered has long become <u>final</u> and <u>executory</u>.  This fact was confirmed by this Court in
AC-G.R. SP No. 05529 (Annex "E", Petition) and even by the High Court
in G.R. No. 70482 (Annex "G", Petition).  It is so elementary that once a judgment has become final and
executory, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is a <u>mandatory</u> and
<u>ministerial</u> duty of a court to issue the writ of execution to enforce
the judgment (Far Eastern Insurance Company vs. De Fernandez, L-30359, October
8, 1978, Sec. 1, Rule 39, Revised Rules of Court).  The trial court was therefore correct in granting the motion for
an alias writ of execution.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, it could not escape the attention of this Court that
all the motions filed by the private respondent and the opposition and counter
motions of the petitioner have been duly acted upon by the respondent
court.  This is evidently clear in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> the order issued by the court on July 3,
1985 (See recitations of facts).  Petitioner has no </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">basis </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">again in claiming that <u>no</u> <u>motion</u>
was ever acted upon by the respondent court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the main, this court finds this petition to be sham and <u>frivolous</u>
and was instituted merely for the purpose of delaying a <u>just</u> <u>and</u> <u>valid</u>
<u>execution</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>judgment</u>.  As was found by this court in AC-G.R. SP. No. 05529, petitioner's
counsels were grossly negligent and appear afflicted in the present petition
with the virus of bad faith and deserve the condemnation of this court.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(p.
157, </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule that once a decision has become final and executory, it
is the ministerial duty of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court </span>to
order its execution, admits of certain exceptions as in cases of special and
exceptional nature where it becomes imperative in the higher interest of
justice to direct the suspension of its execution; or whenever it is necessary
to accomplish the aims of justice; or <u>when</u> <u>certain</u> <u>facts</u> <u>and</u>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there is no doubt that the decision of the
trial court in Civil Case No. 84-23585 has become final and executory, which
fact was affirmed by the Intermediate Appellate Court on March 26, 1985, and by
this Court on May 8, 1985.  It is
significant to note, however, that respondent judge issued on May 15, 1985, a
writ of execution to enforce the judgment against petitioner, after the
petitioner Philippine Veterans Bank has already been placed under receivership
by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank by virtue of Resolution No. 364 on
April 25, 1985, pursuant to Section 29 of the Central Bank Act on insolvency of
banks.  The fact that petitioner was
placed under receivership is a supervening event that renders a judgment,
notwithstanding its finality, unenforceable by attachment or execution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section 29 of Republic
Act No. 265 otherwise known as the Central Bank Act, as amended by Executive

the appropriate supervising or examining department or his examiners or agents
into the condition of any bank or non-bank financial intermediary performing
quasi-banking functions, it shall be disclosed that the condition of the same
is one of insolvency, or that its continuance in business would involve probable
loss to its depositors or creditors, it shall be the duty of the department
head concerned forthwith, in writing, to inform the Monetary Board of the
facts.  The Board may, upon finding the
statements of the department head to be true, <u>forbid</u> <u>the</u> <u>institution</u>

of the bank or non-bank <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">financial

be reorganized or otherwise placed in such a condition so that it may be
permitted to resume business with safety to its depositors and creditors and

resumption of business shall take place as well as the time for fulfillment of
such conditions.  In such case, the
expenses and fees in the collection and administration of the assets of the
institution shall be determined by the Board and shall be paid to the Central
Bank out of the assets of such institution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the Monetary Board shall determine and confirm within the
said period that the bank or non-bank financial intermediary performing
quasi-banking functions is insolvent or cannot resume business with safety to
its depositors, creditors, and the general public, <u>it</u> <u>shall,</u> <u>if</u>

liabilities.  The liquidator designated
as hereunder provided shall, by the Solicitor General file a petition in the
regional trial court reciting the proceedings</span> which have been taken and
praying the assistance of the court in the liquidation of such
institution.  The court shall have

non-bank financial intermediary performing quasi-banking functions and in the
enforcement of individual liabilities of the stockholders, and do all that is

banking or finance, as liquidator who shall take over and </span>continue the
functions of the receiver previously appointed by the Monetary Board under this

counsel </span>as he may retain, institute such actions an may be necessary in
the appropriate court to collect and recover accounts and assets of such
institution or defend any action filed against the institutions:  Provided, However, That after having
reasonably established all claims against the institution, the liquidator may,
with the approval of the court, effect partial payments of such claims from

<p class="BODY">The aforequoted section 29 of the Central Bank's charter
explicitly provides that when a bank is found to be insolvent, the Monetary
Board shall forbid it to do business and shall take charge of all its
assets.  The Board in its Resolution No.
364 banned the bank from pursuing its business and placed it under a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">receiver.  Furthermore, the Board, ordered the liquidation of the bank's properties
on June 7, 1985 upon confirming that it can no longer do business with safety
to its depositors, creditors and general public.  This has the effect of placing the bank's properties under the
custody and jurisdiction of the Monetary Board, thereby removing it from the
jurisdiction and authority of the trial court to enforce its judgment.  Evidently, the sale at public auction of the
properties of petitioner conducted by respondent sheriff on July 8 and 9, 1985,
while it is in the process of liquidation, is not authorized under the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Central Bank v. Morfo No. L-38427, March <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">12,
</span>1975, 63 SCRA 114, that the stay of an execution of judgment is
justified and warranted by the fact that respondent bank was placed under
receivership.  To execute the judgment
would unduly deplete the assets of respondent bank to the obvious prejudice of
other creditors.  After the Monetary
Board has declared that a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bank is
insolvent and has ordered it to cease operations, the Board becomes the trustee
of its assets </span>for the equal benefit of all the depositors and

creditor cannot obtain an advantage or preference over another by an
attachment, execution or otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the later case of Spouses Lipana v. Development Bank of Rizal,
(supra) this Court likewise upheld the stay of the execution of a final
judgment against a bank after it was placed on receivership.  It brushed aside the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
