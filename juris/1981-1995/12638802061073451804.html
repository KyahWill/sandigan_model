				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The People of the Philippines, through the Chief State Prosecutor
of the Department of Justice, the City Fiscal of Manila and the Judge Advocate
General, filed the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, with
a prayer for restraining order/preliminary injunction, to set aside the order
of respondent Judge dated July 7, 1987 granting bail to the accused Rodolfo
Salas alias "Commander <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span>" in Criminal
Case No. 86-48926 for Rebellion,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and the subsequent Order dated July 30, 1987 granting the motion for
reconsideration of 16 July 1987 by increasing the bail bond from P30,000.00 to
P50,000.00 but denying petitioner's supplemental motion for reconsideration of
July 17, 1987 which asked the court to allow petitioner to present evidence in
support of its prayer for a reconsideration of the order of 7 July 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issues presented before Us are whether the right to
bail may, under certain circumstances, be denied to a person who is charged
with an otherwise <span class="SpellE">bailable</span> offense, and whether such
right may be waived.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following are the antecedents of this petition:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the original Information<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
filed on 2 October 1986 in Criminal Case No. 86-48926 of the Regional Trial
Court of Manila, later amended in an Amended Information<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which was filed on 24 October 1986, private respondent Rodolfo Salas, alias
"Commander <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span>", and his co-accused were
charged for the crime of rebellion under Article 134, in relation to Article
135, of the Revised Penal Code allegedly committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That in or about 1968 and for some time before said year and
continuously thereafter until the present time, in the City of Manila and
elsewhere in the Philippines, the Communist Party of the Philippines, its
military arm, the New People's Army, its mass infiltration network, the
National Democratic Front with its other subordinate organizations and fronts,
have, under the direction and control of said organizations' leaders, among
whom are the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> accused, and with the aid,
participation or support of members and followers whose whereabouts and
identities are still unknown, risen publicly and taken arms throughout the
country against the Government of the Republic of the Philippines for the
purpose of overthrowing the present Government, the seat of which is in the
City of Manila, or of removing from the allegiance to that government and its
laws, the country's territory or part of it;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That from 1970 to the present, the above-named accused in their
capacities as leaders of the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> organizations,
in conspiracy with, and in support of the cause of, the organizations
aforementioned, engaged themselves in war against the forces of the government,
destroying property or committing serious violence, and other acts in the
pursuit of their unlawful purpose, such as x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="GramE">then</span> follows the
enumeration of specific acts committed before and after February 1986).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the time the Information was filed the private respondent and
his co-accused were in military custody following their arrest on <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="9">29 September 1986</st1:date> at the Philippine
General Hospital, <st1:address><st1:street>Taft Ave.</st1:street>, <st1:city>Manila</st1:city></st1:address>;
he had earlier escaped from military detention and a cash reward of P250<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was offered for his capture.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A day after the filing of the original information, or on 3
October 1986, a petition for habeas corpus for private respondent and his
co-accused was filed with this Court<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
which, as shall hereafter be discussed in detail, was dismissed in Our
resolution of 16 October 1986 on the basis of the agreement of the parties
under which herein private respondent "will remain in legal custody and
will face trial before the court having custody over his person" and the
warrants for the arrest of his co-accused are deemed recalled and they shall be
immediately released but shall submit themselves to the court having
jurisdiction over their person.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 7, 1986, private respondent filed with the court
below a Motion to Quash the Information alleging that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the facts alleged do not constitute an
offense; (b) the Court has no jurisdiction over the offense charged; (c) the
Court has no jurisdiction over the persons of the defendants; and (d) the
criminal action or liability has been extinguished,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

citing, among other grounds, the fact that in the Joint Manifestation and
Motion dated October 14, 1986, in G. R. No. 76009, private respondent
categorically conceded that:</p>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Par. 2(b) - Petitioner Rodolfo Salas will remain in <u>legal</u>
<u>custody</u> <u>and</u> <u>face</u> <u>trial</u> before the court having
custody over his person."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his Order of <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="3">March 6,
 1987</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent Judge denied the motion to quash.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of asking for a reconsideration of said Order, private
respondent filed on 9 May 1987 a petition for bail,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
which herein petitioner opposed in an Opposition filed on 27 May 1987<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
on the ground that since rebellion became a capital offense under the
provisions of P.D. Nos. 1996, 942 and 1834, which amended Article 135 of the
Revised Penal Code, by imposing the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> <u>to</u> <u>death</u> on those who promote,
maintain, or head a rebellion, the accused is no longer entitled to bail as
evidence of his guilt is strong.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="6">5 June 1987</st1:date>
the President issued Executive Order No. 187 repealing, among others, P.D. Nos.
1996, 942 and 1834 and restoring to full force and effect Article 135 of the
Revised Penal Code as it existed before the amendatory decrees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the original penalty for rebellion, <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> and a fine not to exceed P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, was restored.</p>

<p class="BODY">Executive Order No. 187 was published in the Official Gazette in
its <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1987</st1:date> issue
(Vol. 83, No. 24) which was officially released for circulation on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Order of 7 July 1987,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent Judge, taking into consideration Executive Order No. 187, granted
private respondent's petition for bail, fixed the bail bond at P30,000.00 and
imposed upon private respondent the additional condition that he shall report
to the court once every two (2) months within the first ten (10) days of every
period thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In granting the petition
respondent Judge stated:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
There is no more debate that with the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
Executive Order No. 187, the offense of rebellion, for which accused Rodolfo
Salas is herein charged, is now punishable with the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> and a fine not exceeding P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, which makes it now <span class="SpellE">bailable</span>
pursuant to Section 13, Article III, 1986 Constitution and Section 3, Rule 114,
1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike
the old rule, bail is now a matter of right in non-capital offenses before
final judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is very evident
upon a reading of Section 3, Rule 114, aforementioned, in relation to Section
21, same rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view, therefore, of
the present circumstances in this case, said accused-applicant is now entitled
to bail as a matter of right inasmuch as the crime of rebellion ceased to be a
capital offense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the contention of herein petitioner that it would be
dangerous to grant bail to private respondent considering his stature in the
CPP-NPA hierarchy, whose ultimate and overriding goal is to wipe out all
vestiges of our democracy and to replace it with their ideology, and that his
release would allow his return to his organization to direct its armed struggle
to topple the government before whose courts he invokes his constitutional
right to bail, respondent Judge replied:</p>

<blockquote>"True, there now appears a clash between the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> constitutional right to bail in a non-capital
offense, which right is guaranteed in the Bill of Rights and, to quote again
the prosecution, 'the existence of the government that bestows the right, the
paramount interest of the state.' Suffice to state that the Bill of Rights, one
of which is the right to bail, is a 'declaration of the rights of the
individual, civil, political and social and economic, guaranteed by the Constitution
against impairment or intrusion by any form of governmental action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emphasis is placed on the dignity of man and
the worth of individual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
recognition of certain inherent and inalienable rights of the individual, which
the government is prohibited from violating' (<span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>-Fernando,
Philippine Constitutional Law, 1984 Edition, p. 77).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this Court, in case of such conflict as
now pictured by the prosecution, the same should be resolved in favor of the
individual who, in the eyes of the law, is alone in the assertion of his rights
under the Bill of Rights as against the State.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, the government is that powerful and strong, having the
resources, manpower and the <span class="SpellE">wherewithals</span> to fight
those 'who <span class="GramE">oppose,</span> <span class="SpellE">threathen</span>
(sic) and destroy a just and orderly society and its existing civil and
political institutions.' The prosecution's fear may or may not be founded that
the accused may later on jump bail and rejoin his comrades in the field to sow
further disorders and anarchy against the duly constituted authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, then, such a fear can not be a reason to
deny him bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the law is very
explicit that when it comes to <span class="SpellE">bailable</span> offenses an
accused is entitled as a matter of right to bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>Dura</u></span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE"><u>est</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lex</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>sed</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lex</u></span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a motion to reconsider<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
the above order filed on 16 July 1987, petitioner asked the court to increase
the bail from P30,000.00 to P100,000.00 alleging therein that per Department of
Justice Circular No. 10 dated 3 July 1987, the bail for the provisional release
of an accused should be in an amount computed at P10,000.00 per year of
imprisonment based on the medium penalty imposable for the offense and
explaining that it is, recommending P100,000.00 because the private respondent
"had in the past escaped from the custody of the military authorities and
the offense for which he is charged is not an ordinary crime, like murder,
homicide or robbery, where after the commission, the perpetrator has achieved
his end" and that "the rebellious acts are not consummated until the
well-organized plan to overthrow the government through armed struggle and
replace it with an alien system based on a foreign ideology is attained."</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 July 1987, petitioner filed a supplemental motion for
reconsideration<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
indirectly asking the court to deny bail to the private respondent and to allow
it to present evidence in support thereof considering the "inevitable
probability that the accused will not comply with this main condition of his
bail - to appear in court for trial," a conclusion it claims to be buttressed
"by the following facts which are widely known by the People of the
Philippines and which this Honorable Court may have judicial notice of:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused has evaded the authorities for thirteen
years and was an escapee from detention when arrested;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not arrested at his residence as he
had no known address;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was using the false name "Manuel
Mercado Castro" at the time of his arrest and presented a Driver's License
to substantiate his false identity;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The address he gave "<span class="SpellE">Panamitan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Kawit</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,"
turned out to be also a false address;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and his companions were on board a private
vehicle with a declared owner whose identity and <span class="GramE">address were</span>
also found to be false;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant</span> to Ministry Order No. 1-A
dated <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="1">11 January 1982</st1:date>, a
reward of P250,000.00 was offered and paid for his arrest,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">which</span>
"clearly indicate that the accused does not entertain the slightest
intention to appear in court for trial, if released." Petitioner further
argues that the accused, who is the Chairman of the Communist Party of the
Philippines and head of its military arm, the NPA, together with his followers,
are now engaged in an open warfare and rebellion against this government and
threatens the existence of this very Court from which he now seeks provisional
release," and that while he is entitled to bail as a matter of right in
view of Executive Order No. 187 which restored the original penalty for
rebellion under Article 135 of the Revised Penal Code, yet, when the interest
of the State conflicts with that of an individual, that of the former prevails
for "the right of the State of self-preservation is paramount to any of
the rights of an individual enshrined in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution."
Petitioner further invokes precedents in the United States of America holding
"that there is no absolute constitutional barrier to detention of
potentially dangerous resident aliens pending deportation proceedings,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
and that an arrestee may be incarcerated until trial as he presents a risk of
flight;<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and sustaining a detention prior to trial of arrestee charged with serious
felonies who are found after an adversary hearing to pose threat to the safety
of individuals and to the community which no condition of release can
dispel."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="7">30 July 1987</st1:date>
respondent Judge handed down the Order<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
adverted to in the introductory portion of this decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the
Court finds the ‘supplemental’ motion for reconsideration to be without merit
and hereby denies it but finds the first motion for reconsideration to be
meritorious only insofar as the amount of bail is concerned and hereby
reconsiders its Order of July 7, 1987 only to increase the amount of bail from
P30,000.00 to P50,000.00, subject to the approval of this Court, and with the
additional condition that accused Rodolfo Salas shall report to the court once
every two (2) months within the first ten (10) days of every period thereof (<span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, et al.,
L-31665, August 6, 1975, 66 SCRA 58)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In denying the supplemental motion for reconsideration the
respondent Judge took into account the "sudden turn-about" on the
part of the petitioner in that a day earlier it filed a motion for
reconsideration wherein it conceded the right of the private respondent to bail
but merely asked to increase the amount of bail; observed that it is only a
reiteration of arguments in its opposition to the petition for bail of 25 May
1987; asserted that the American precedents are not applicable since the cases
involved deportation of aliens and, moreover, the U.S. Federal Constitution
does not contain a proviso on the right of an accused to bail in <span class="SpellE">bailable</span> offenses, but only an injunction against excessive
bail; and quoted the concurring opinion of the late Justice Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> in the cases of Nava, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Gatmaitan</span>,
L-4853, Hernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span>, L-4964 and Angeles vs.
<span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>, L-5108, October 11, 1951, 90 Phil 172.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to agree with said Order, petitioner commenced this
petition submitting therein the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>"THE HONORABLE RESPONDENT JUDGE PROCORO J. DONATO ACTED WITH
GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND IN EXCESS OF HIS JURISDICTION, AND IN TOTAL
DISREGARD OF THE PREVAILING REALITIES, WHEN HE DENIED PETITIONER'S SUPPLEMENTAL
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION WITH PRAYER TO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDUCE
EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF ITS OPPOSITION TO THE GRANT OF BAIL TO THE RESPONDENT
RODOLFO SALAS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE HONORABLE RESPONDENT JUDGE PROCORO J. DONATO ACTED WITH GRAVE
ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND IN EXCESS OF HIS JURISDICTION WHEN HE GRANTED BAIL TO
THE RESPONDENT RODOLFO SALAS."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">in support of which petitioner argues
that private respondent is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from invoking his
right to bail, having expressly waived it in G. R. No. 76009 when he agreed to
"remain in legal custody and face trial before the court having custody of
his person" in consideration of the recall of the warrant of arrest for
his co-petitioners Josefina Cruz and Jose <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>;
and the right to bail, even in non-capital offenses, is not absolute when there
is prima facie evidence that the accused is a serious threat to the very
existence of the State, in which case the prosecution must be allowed to
present evidence for the denial of bail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion when
he did not allow petitioner to present all the evidence it may desire to
support its prayer for the denial of bail and when he declared that the State
has forfeited its right to do so since during all the time that the petition
for bail was pending, it never manifested, much less hinted, its intention to
adduce such evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that even if
release on bail may be allowed, respondent judge, in fixing the amount of bail
at P50,000.00 (originally P30,000.00 only), failed to take into account the
lengthy record of private respondents’ criminal background, the gravity of the
pending charge, and the likelihood of flight.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

wherein he manifests that he supports the petition and submits that the Order
of respondent Judge of July 7, July 17 and July 30, 1987 should be annulled and
set aside asserting that private respondent had waived the right to bail in
view of the agreement in G. R. No. 76009; that granting bail to him is
accepting wide-eyed his undertaking which he is sure to break; in determining
bail, the primary consideration is to insure the attendance of the accused at
the trial of the case against him, which would be frustrated by the
"almost certainty that respondent Salas will jump bail of whatever
amount"; and application of the guidelines provided for in Section 10 of
Rule 114, 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure on the amount of bail dictates
denial of bail to private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General likewise maintains that the right of the petitioner
to hearing on the application of private respondent for bail cannot be denied
by respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">And now<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on
the issues presented in this case.</span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Unquestionably, at the time the original and the amended <span class="SpellE">Informations</span> for rebellion and the application for bail
were filed before the court below the penalty imposable for the offense for
which the private respondent was charged was <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> <u>to</u> <u>death</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the application for bail Executive Order No. 187 was issued by the
President, by virtue of which the penalty for rebellion as originally provided
for in Article 135 of the Revised Penal Code was restored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restored law was the governing law at the
time the respondent court resolved the petition for bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the respondent court that bail cannot be denied to
the private respondent for he is charged with the crime of rebellion as defined
in Article 134 of the Revised Penal Code to which is attached the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> and a fine not exceeding
P20,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
It is, therefore, a <span class="SpellE"><u>bailable</u></span> <u>offense</u> under
Section 13 of Article III of the 1987 Constitution which provides thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 13.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>All persons, except those charged with
offenses punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
when evidence of guilt is strong, shall, before conviction, be <span class="SpellE">bailable</span> by sufficient sureties, or be released on
recognizance as may be prescribed by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The right to bail shall not be impaired even when the privilege of the
writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> is suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Excessive bail shall not be required."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 3, Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, as amended, also
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"<u>Bail,</u> <u>a</u> <u>matter</u> <u>of</u>
<u>right;</u> <u>exception</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
All persons in custody shall, before final conviction, be entitled to bail as a
matter of right, except those charged with a capital offense or an offense
which, under the law at the time of its commission and at the time of the
application for bail, is punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
when evidence of guilt is strong.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, before conviction bail is either a matter of right or
of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a matter of right
when the offense charged is punishable by any penalty lower than <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">And so, in a similar case for rebellion, <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Hernandez</u>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>., 99 Phil 515, despite the fact that the
accused was already convicted, although erroneously, by the trial court for the
complex crime of rebellion with multiple murders, arsons and robberies, and
sentenced to life imprisonment, We granted bail in the amount of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of his
appeal from such conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
vigorous stand of the People that <span class="GramE">We</span> must deny bail to
the accused because the security of the State so requires, and because the
judgment of conviction appealed from indicates that the evidence of guilt of
Hernandez is strong, We held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Furthermore, individual freedom is too basic, too transcendental and vital in a
republican state, like ours, to be derived upon mere general principles and
abstract consideration of public safety.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the preservation of liberty is such a major preoccupation of our
political system that, not satisfied with guaranteeing its enjoyment in the
very first paragraph of section (1) of the Bill of Rights, the framers of our
Constitution devoted paragraphs (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (11), (12), (13),
(14), (15), (16), (17), (18), and (21) of said section (1) to the protection of
several aspects of freedom."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The 1987 Constitution strengthens further the right to bail by
explicitly providing that it shall not be impaired even when the privilege of
the writ of habeas corpus is suspended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This overturns the Court's ruling in <u>Garcia-Padilla</u> <u>vs</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Enrile</u></span> <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>, <span class="GramE"><u>supra.</u>,</span>
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus
must, indeed, carry with it the suspension of the right to bail, if the
government's campaign to suppress the rebellion is to be enhanced and rendered
effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the right to bail may be
demanded during the continuance of the rebellion, and those arrested, captured
and detained in the course thereof will be released, they would, without the
least doubt, rejoin their comrades in the field thereby jeopardizing the
success of government efforts to bring to an end the invasion, rebellion or
insurrection."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, if the offense charged is punishable by <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> bail becomes a matter of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall be denied if the
evidence of guilt is strong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court's
discretion is limited to determining whether or not evidence of guilt is strong.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
But once it is determined that the evidence of guilt is not strong, bail also
becomes a matter of right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Teehankee</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <u>Director</u> <u>of</u> <u>Prisons</u>,
<span class="GramE"><u>supra</u>.,</span> We held:</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the prosecution does not have the right to present
evidence for the denial of bail in the instances where bail is a matter of
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in the cases where the
grant of bail is discretionary, due process requires that the prosecution must
be given an opportunity to present, within a reasonable time, all the evidence

<p class="BODY">We agree, however, with petitioner that it was error for the
respondent court to fix the bond at P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, then
later at P50,000.00 without hearing the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guidelines for the fixing of the amount
of bail provided for in Section 10 of Rule 114 of the Rules of Court are not
matters left entirely to the discretion of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span> stated in <u>People</u>

<blockquote>"Certain guidelines in the fixing of a <span class="SpellE">bailbond</span>
call for the presentation of evidence and reasonable opportunity for the
prosecution to refute it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among them are
the nature and circumstances of the crime, character and reputation of the

appearing at the trial, whether or not the accused is a fugitive from justice,
and whether or not the accused is under bond in other case x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case petitioner has sufficiently made out
allegations which necessitate a grant of an opportunity to be heard for the
purpose of determining the amount of bail, but not for the denial thereof

bail.</p>

dated October 14, 1986 filed by Attorneys Romeo <span class="SpellE">Capulong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Arno</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Sanidad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> H. Mercado and Ricardo Fernandez, Jr. as counsel for
petitioners and Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span> and Assistant Solicitor General Romeo C. de la Cruz
and Trial Attorney <span class="SpellE">Josue</span> S. Villanueva as counsel for
respondents which states that they have entered into an agreement whereby:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[a] the petition for habeas corpus will be
withdrawn by petitioners, and Josefina Cruz and Joe Milo <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
will be immediately released but shall appear at the trial of the criminal case
for rebellion [People vs. Rodolfo Salas, et al., Criminal Case No. 4886,
Regional Trial Court, National Capital Judicial Region, Branch XII, Manila],
filed against them, on their personal recognizance; [b] petitioner Rodolfo
Salas will remain in legal custody and face trial before the court having
custody over his person; and [c] the warrant of arrest for the person of
Josefina Cruz and Jose Milo <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> is hereby
deemed recalled in view of the formal manifestation before this Court that they
will submit themselves to the court having jurisdiction over their person and
in view of the said agreement, the petition for habeas corpus be dismissed, the
Court Resolved to DISMISS the petition for habeas corpus but subject to the
condition that petitioners' lead counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Capulong</span>,
upon his oath as member of the Bar, shall abide by his commitment to ensure the
appearance of Josefina Cruz and Jose Milo <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
at the trial of the criminal case for rebellion filed against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, C.J., is
on official leave."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the stand of the petitioner that private respondent,
"in agreeing to remain in legal custody even during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the trial of is criminal <span class="GramE">case,</span>
[he] has expressly waived his right to bail."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon the other hand, private respondent asserts that this claim is totally
devoid of factual and legal basis, for in their petition for habeas corpus they
precisely questioned the legality of the arrest and the continued detention of
Rodolfo Salas, Josefina Cruz and Jose Milo <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
which was not resolved by this Court or by the compromise agreement of the
parties but left open for further determination in another proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the matter of the right to bail was
neither raised by either party nor resolved by this Court, and the legal steps
promptly taken by private respondent after the agreement was reached, like the
filing of the motion to quash on 7 November 1986 and the petition for bail on
14 May 1987, were clear and positive assertions of his statutory and
constitutional rights to be granted not only provisional but final and
permanent liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, private
respondent maintains that the term "legal custody" as used in the
Joint Manifestation and Motion simply means that private respondent agreed to
continue to be in the custody of the law or in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span> and nothing else; it is not to be
interpreted as waiver.</p>

<p class="BODY">Interestingly, private respondent admits that:</p>

<blockquote>"'Custody' has been held to mean nothing less than actual
imprisonment. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is also defined as the <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> of a person by virtue of a lawful authority, or
the 'care and possession of a thing or person.' (<span class="SpellE">Bouviers</span>
Law Dictionary, Third Ed., Vol. I, pp. 741-742 citing Smith v. Com. 59 Pa. 320
and Rolland v. Com. 82 Pa. 306)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">He further admits that, in the light of Section 1 of Rule 114 of
the Rules of Court and settled jurisprudence, the "constitutional right to
bail is subject to the limitation that the person applying for admission to
bail should be in the custody of the law or otherwise deprived of his liberty.”<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When the parties in G. R. No. 76009 stipulated that:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">b. Petitioner</span> Rodolfo Salas <u>will</u>
<u>remain</u> <u>in</u> <u>legal</u> <u>custody</u> and face trial before the <u>court</u>
<u>having</u> <u>custody</u> <u>over</u> <u>his</u> <u>person</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">they simply meant that Rodolfo Salas, herein
respondent, will remain in actual physical custody of the court, or in actual
confinement or detention, as distinguished from the stipulation concerning his
co-petitioners, who were to be <u>released</u> in view of the <u>recall</u> of
the warrants of arrest against them; they agreed, however, "to submit
themselves to the <u>court</u> <u>having</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> <u>over</u> <u>their</u>
<u>persons</u>." Note should be made of the deliberate care of the parties
in making a fine distinction between <u>legal</u> <u>custody</u> and <u>court</u>
<u>having</u> <u>custody</u> <u>over</u> <u>the</u> <u>person</u> in respect to
Rodolfo Salas and <u>court</u> <u>having</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> over <u>the</u>
<u>persons</u> of his co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
fine distinction was precisely intended to emphasize the agreement that <u>Rodolfo</u>
<u>Salas</u> will not be released, but should remain in custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the parties intended otherwise, or had
this been unclear to private respondent and his counsel, they should have
insisted on the use of a clearer language.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be remembered that at the time the parties orally manifested before
this Court on <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="10">14 October 1986</st1:date>
the terms and conditions of their agreement and prepared and signed the Joint
Manifestation and Motion, a warrant of arrest had already been issued by the
trial court against private respondent and his co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stipulation that only the warrants of
arrest for Josefina Cruz and Jose Milo <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
shall be recalled and that only they shall be released, further confirmed the
agreement that herein petitioner shall remain in custody of the law, or
detention or confinement.</p>

<p class="BODY">In defining bail as:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the

<u>custody</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>law</u>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 1 of Rule 114 of the Revised
Rules of Court admits no other meaning or interpretation for the term "in
custody of the law" than that as above indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of bail is to relieve an accused
from imprisonment until his conviction and yet secure his appearance at the
trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, having <u>agreed</u> in G. R. No. 76009 to remain
in legal custody, private respondent had <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span>
waived his right to bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, is such waiver valid?</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 6 of the Civil Code expressly provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rights may be
waived, unless the waiver is contrary to law, public order, public policy,
morals, or good customs, or prejudicial to a third person with a right
recognized by law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Waiver is defined as "a voluntary and intentional
relinquishment or abandonment of a known existing legal right, advantage,
benefit, claim or privilege, which except for such waiver the party would have
enjoyed; the voluntary abandonment or surrender, by a capable person, of a
right known by him to exist, with the intent that such right shall be
surrendered and such person forever deprived of its benefit; or such conduct as
warrants an inference of the relinquishment of such right; or the intentional
doing of an act inconsistent with claiming it."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to what rights and privileges may be waived, the authority is
settled:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
doctrine of waiver extends to rights and privileges of any character, and,
since the word 'waiver' covers every conceivable right, it is the general rule
that a person may waive any matter which affects his property, and any
alienable right or privilege of which he is the owner or which belongs to him
or to which he is legally entitled, whether secured by contract, conferred with
statute, <u>or</u> <u>guaranteed</u> <u>by</u> <u>constitution</u>, provided
such rights and privileges rest in the individual, are intended for his sole
benefit, do not infringe on the rights of others, and further provided the
waiver of the right or privilege is not forbidden by law, and does not
contravene public policy; and the principle is recognized that everyone has a
right to waive, and agree to waive, the advantage of a law or rule made solely
for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity, if it
can be dispensed with and relinquished without infringing on any public right,
and without detriment to the community at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Although the general rule is that any right or privilege conferred
by statute or <u>guaranteed</u> <u>by</u> <u>constitution</u> may be waived, a
waiver in derogation of a statutory right is not favored, and a waiver will be
inoperative and void if it infringes on the rights of others, or would be
against public policy or morals and the public interest may be waived.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it has been stated generally that all personal rights
conferred by statute and <u>guaranteed</u> <u>by</u> <u>constitution</u> may be
waived, it has also been said that constitutional provisions intended to
protect property may be waived, and even some of the constitutional rights
created to secure personal liberty are subjects of waiver.”<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
