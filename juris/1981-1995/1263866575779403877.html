<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Bureau of Internal
Revenue was reorganized in 1987 pursuant to </span><span style="">E</span><span style="">xecutive Order No.
127.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To "assist the appointing
authority in the judicious selection and placement of personnel in the
reorganization," the Civil Service Commission created a Placement
Committee, and among other things authorized "a representative of the CSC
* * (on request) to render assistance to the committee."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to the reorganization, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
Chang was the Chief of the Fiscal Operations Branch of Revenue Region R-B1, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new <span class="SpellE">plantilla</span>
drawn up in line with the reorganization, converted her position to <i style=""><span style="">Chief</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">Revenue</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">Officer
(CRO) III</span></i><span style="">; </span>and the Placement Committee -- applying the guidelines laid
down by the CSC,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and then assisted by the CSC representative, Assistant Director Leticia <span class="SpellE">Bugtong</span> -- recommended that Chang be appointed to the new office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same recommendation was made by Chang's
immediate superior, the Regional Director, Revenue Region (RR) No. 4-B1, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The recommendation was protested by a certain Atty. Tito R. <span class="SpellE">Pintor</span>, who claimed to be better qualified for the position
of CRO III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BIR Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span style="">A. </span>Tan,
Jr. opined that the protest was <span style="">premature
considering that “the promotional appointment of Ms. ** Chang to the position
of Chief Revenue </span><span class="SpellE">Officxer</span><span style=""> III has not yet been made.” In any case,
Commissioner Tan pointed out, "a comparison of the qualification, training
and experience of the protestant and <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> will
readily show that <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> Chang edges protestant <span class="SpellE">Pintor</span> in training and experience to the alleged proposed
contested position **, (considering among other things that) she has been
actually discharging the functions of the Chief, Fiscal Operations Branch,
Revenue Region No. 4-B1, BIR, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City </span><span style="">**."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Commissioner Tan thereafter appointed Chang permanent CRO III
retroactive to <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appointment was <span style="">approved as permanent by the CSC.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pintor</span>

on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="2"><span style="">February 24, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">; but the latter resolved the protest against him, by resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="5"><span style="">May 10,
 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This did not end petitioner Chang's travails, however, for
another protest was filed with the BIR Reorganization Appeals Board
(BIR-RAB).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second protest was
presented by <span class="SpellE">Anthea</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Maderazo</span>,
who also asserted a preferential right to be appointed CRO III on account of
her allegedly superior qualifications.</p>

<p class="BODY">The BIR-RAB ruled against Ms. <span class="SpellE">Maderazo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She appealed to the CSC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CSC dismissed her appeal, by Resolution
promulgated <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1988</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
but affirmed "her appointment to the position of Revenue Enforcement
Officer pursuant to Executive Order 127, which is comparable to her former
position of Revenue Fiscal Officer." However, the CSC revoked petitioner
Chang's appointment as CRO III "in the interest of justice and
fairness." According to the CSC-</p>

<blockquote><span style="">" </span>* * (although)
her education and eligibility meets the minimum requirements of the Chief
Revenue Officer III position, she failed to meet the minimum experience
requirement of the subject position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
eight (8) months service as Revenue Document Processor of the Bureau prior to
its reorganization fall short of the 5 years experience requirement of the
positions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
Commission thus directed "her appointment to any other position in the new
staffing pattern of the Bureau, where her qualifications are best fitted, which
in no case (should be) lower than her former position before the BIR
reorganization."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Chang filed a motion for
reconsideration dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="11"><span style="">November 18, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, contending that her nine-year experience as
Chief Accountant II of the Professional Regulations Commission invested her
with the requisite minimum experience.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Chang's immediate
superior, the Regional Director, Revenue Region 4-B1, filed a
"Supplemental Memorandum to ** (Chang's) Motion for Reconsideration
**," dated November 18, 1988, asserting that the records -- which, it was
intimated, were not then before the CSC -- do show Chang's fulfillment of the
prescribed experience requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BIR
Commissioner Tan also asked that the decision be reconsidered, in a letter to
the CSC Chairman dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="12"><span style="">December 17, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tan
pointed out <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>" ** (Chang's) experience as Chief
Accountant as per certification issued by the Professional Regulations
Commission ** is sufficient to consider her to the position of Chief Revenue
Officer III since she was also in­-charge of various revenue operations
activities and planning <span style="">for </span>more
than nine (9) years which is more than the required minimum <span style="">five </span>(5) years experience for the
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her duties and
responsibilities in the Professional Regulations Commission as Chief Accountant
as can be gleaned from the certification issued by it are the same duties and
responsibilities she is performing as Chief Revenue Officer <span style="">III, </span>Fiscal Operations Branch, Revenue
Region No. 4-B1, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City (see RAO 3-87 hereto attached
and certification of the Chief, Adm. Branch).</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * * * *.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She corrected the deficiencies cited in the COA Annual Audit
Report on the fiscal operations of the BIR, RR-4-B1, Q.C. for the calendar year
1985 bearing on weak internal control pertaining to the financial operations of
the Region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This aspect of the COA audit
report influenced greatly the Regional Director in favoring Mrs. Chang over the
OIC, as well as the former Assistant Chief of the Fiscal Operations
Branch."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The CSC declined to
reconsider its Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="10"><span style="">October 28, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It declared that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“ ** (Chang's) more than five (5) years experience as Chief
Accountant in the PRC cannot be considered in her favor, as this is not the
kind of experience the Qualification Standard for Chief Revenue Officer III
position requires.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The nature of the functions of said position relates more on the
application of tax or revenue laws, the determination of the kind and extent of
taxes due and collectible and the performance of functions which directly involve
revenue operations activities in the Bureau itself which makes the functions
and responsibilities thereof broader in scope than that of the Chief
Accountant.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Impugning these rulings of the CSC, and seeking their annulment,
petitioner Chang has appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The whole question really
is, whose assessment should be deemed decisive on whether or not, in light of
the undisputed facts, Chang possesses the requisite five-year experience
prescribed for the position of Chief Revenue Officer III in the Bureau of
Internal Revenue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the assessment of the
BIR head and of Chang's immediate superior, or that of the Civil Service
Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The immediate,
commonsensical answer would seem to be:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that of the former, since it may be reasonably assumed that the BIR
Commissioner and the Regional Director, under whom Chang will render services
as CRO III, know best the precise nature and extent of the services required of
her and her ability to render them, based not only on her past work record but
her actual, observed performance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The answer is one that
reflective analysis of the relevant factors confirms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minimum qualifications for Chang's office
laid down in the Revised Qualification Standards drafted by the BIR itself are
the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>EDUCATION<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bachelor's degree in Commerce or
Business Administration, major in Accounting or Management; Bachelor's degree
relevant to the job;</blockquote>

<blockquote>EXPERIENCE<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five (5) years of progressively responsible
experience in various revenue operations activities or other related works
which must include planning, coordinating and supervising revenue operations
activities;</blockquote>

<blockquote>CIVIL SERVICE<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CPA, Bar, Career Service (Prof.) or relevant
Second </blockquote>

<blockquote>ELIGIBILITY<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Level eligibility.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
officers of the Bureau of Internal Revenue would seem to be the best qualified
to interpret the norms thus laid down, which they had themselves drafted, or
helped to formulate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, as to the
factor of experience, about which the controversy at bar revolves, the BIR
officials have evidently considered Chang's nine-year stint in the Professional
Regulations Commission, her last position there being Chief Accountant II, as
equivalent to work "related" to revenue operations activities,
including “planning, coordinating and supervising” the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as the Solicitor General stresses,
Chang's "duties, functions and responsibilities as PRC Chief Accountant
for almost eight years prior to her 8 months working stint with the BIR"
are well nigh identical to, or reveal "a one to one correspondence" with,
those specified for CRO III of the BIR.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her duties and functions in the PRC included the following:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All things considered,
the Court is satisfied that petitioner Chang's qualifications for the office of
CRO III were correctly <span class="SpellE">analysed</span>, weighed and rated by
the BIR officials concerned, and that the CSC in effect is here attempting to
substitute its judgment on the matter for that of the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In doing so, respondent CSC has exceeded its
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CSC is not a co-manager,
or surrogate administrator of Government offices and agencies. Its function and
authority are limited to approving or reviewing appointments to determine their
concordance with the requirements of the Civil Service Law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the determination of this
question, the views and conclusions of the appointing authority should be
accorded no little respect, and should not be lightly disregarded and set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those views and conclusions may
be rejected and overruled only when shown to be clearly in error or attended by
bad faith or other improper motives or considerations; and reasonable
differences in the appraisal of qualifications should be resolved in favor of
the appointing authority which, after all, will avail of the appointee's
services, deal with him on a day-to-day basis, and be generally responsible for
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite recently, the Court <i>en </i></span><i>banc</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">had occasion to point out that "the determination of who among
several candidates for a vacant position has the best qualifications is vested
in the sound discretion of the Department Head or appointing authority and not
in the Civil Service Commission. * * Given the demands of a certain job, who
can do it best should be left to the Head of the office concerned provided the
legal requirements for the office are satisfied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Service Commission cannot
substitute its judgment for that of the Head of Office in this regard."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
