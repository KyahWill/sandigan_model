				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The single gunshot pierced the victim's heart and killed him on
the spot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also placed the
accused-appellants in the shadow of the electric chair and before this Court in
a plea for their lives.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing took place in the victim's house in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Isidro</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:city><st1:place>San Francisco</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, on <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1982</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight o'clock</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the trial court found, <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> was having supper with his family, which was
seated on the floor around the common fare.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The house was illuminated with two kerosene lamps hanging from the walls
and another one on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hearing
someone at the door and thinking it was their married son <span class="SpellE">Recoleto</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> called to
him to come and join them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no
answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span>
then told his son Nelson to see who it was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nelson rose to obey but before he could open the door, it was flung open
and two men carrying handguns barged in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One shouted, "This is a robbery!" while the other stayed
behind him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first one was
subsequently identified as <span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and his companion as Henry <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> who
confronted <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> while the latter was still seated
and without much ado shot him point-blank on the chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> slumped
dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Liston</span>
then kicked the kerosene lamp on the floor and fled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> followed,
the announced robbery apparently forgotten.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Samuel <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> pursued them in vain until they
disappeared in the darkness of the nearby cassava plantation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The killing was immediately reported to the police, who came that
same night to investigate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused-appellants were named by <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> and her son Samuel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The following morning, <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> were arrested just before they were to leave for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in a pump boat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were subsequently
charged with murder, to which they both pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> were positively identified by <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span>
<span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> and her son Samuel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mother and son swore they knew both <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> and <span class="GramE">that</span> they readily recognized the two when they intruded into
their home that fatal night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
these witnesses who related in detail the killing of <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Batidor</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The gunshot wound was described by Dr. Jose O. <span class="SpellE">Bardenas</span>,
the municipal health officer who examined the corpse soon after the incident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The fourth prosecution witness was P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Damiano</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Rocacurva</span>, who testified on his investigation of the case
and the arrest of the accused-appellants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of the two accused-appellants was alibi, both
claiming they were nowhere at the scene of the crime when it was
committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they said,
they were at that time in <span class="SpellE">Bebanco's</span> house, where they
slept, awaking at about 3 to 4 o'clock the following morning to go to the pump
boat for their trip to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

It was shortly afterwards, before they could board, that they were both
arrested for the killing of <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both denied
any involvement in the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Liston</span> claimed he did not know the <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span>
family and could not say why they should implicate him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> said he knew the <span class="SpellE">Batidors</span>
but saw no reason why they should point to him as one of the culprits.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other three witnesses for the defense did not do much for the
accused-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Antonio <span class="SpellE">Porcare</span>, the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain to
whom they were brought after their arrest, merely testified that they were
searched in his house by the police officers, who found nothing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Ner</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span> simply declared
that <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span>
went to his house in the evening of <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="2">February
 8, 1982</st1:date>, to tell him they were going to ride in the pump boat of
which he was a crew member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said they
left at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Obaldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>, for his part,
stated that <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> had indeed borrowed P300.00 from
him and that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight o'clock</st1:time> of
<st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1982</st1:date>, he heard
the two talking about the trip they were taking at dawn the following day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were then buying some things at his
store, which they left shortly thereafter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Disbelieving the defense, Judge <span class="SpellE">Regino</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermosisima</span>, Jr. of the then <st1:place><st1:placename>Circuit</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Criminal</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
rendered the appealed judgment,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> the
<span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and Henry "Boy" <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span>
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER described in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the finding of the following aggravating circumstances:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) dwelling; (2) nighttime; (3) abuse of
superior strength; (4) disregard of the respect due the age of the deceased;
and (5) use of an unlicensed firearm in the killing of the offended party, the
said circumstances not having been offset by any mitigating circumstances
adduced and proven by the accused, the accused should be, as they each are,
hereby sentenced to the extreme penalty of death, with the accessory penalties
of the law; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> in the sum of P12,000.00; and to pay the
costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue involved in this case is the credibility of the
witnesses, which is left primarily to the trial judge to assess in view of his
advantage in observing their demeanor on the stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court can go only by the
records, without the opportunity of seeing for itself how the persons
testifying react to the questions put to them and noting those little gestures
and telltale signs that can limn the line between fact and fabrication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are not found in the transcript and so
may not be fully appreciated on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the trial judge can see all these.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the rule is that his findings on this matter are accorded much
respect, if not indeed conclusive effect, save only in those exceptional
instances where they are clearly shown to be arbitrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">When therefore the defense now argues that the trial judge erred
in giving credence to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> on how her husband was killed by <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span>, the averment
must be received with not a little misgiving.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> knew both of the accused-appellants
and could easily recognize them by the light of the three kerosene lamps in the
room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So too could Samuel <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span>, who out of unreasoning rage pursued his father's
killers although he was unarmed and only fourteen years old.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span>
testified that there was no grudge between them and the <span class="SpellE">Batidors</span>,
which made their identification by these witnesses more believable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no reason for them to implicate the
accused-appellants except the simple fact that they saw <span class="SpellE">Liston</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> force their way into their house and kill
<span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is not likely that these witnesses, who hardly knew the accused-appellants,
would denounce them without cause, knowing that the penalty then for the
offense of murder could be death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of the defense that the crime was pinned on the
accused-appellants simply because of the happenstance that they were leaving
together for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> is not acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That was not the cause of their arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason they were arrested was the
positive identification made of them by <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> and her son Samuel, who were both present when <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> was killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the intended trip in the pump boat was not really a
happenstance but was evidently timed deliberately as part of the plot <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> had
conceived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crime was to be committed
in the evening of <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1982</st1:date>,
and they were to make their escape to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
the following early morning in the pump boat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trip was indeed "pre-arranged," as the defense insists,
but not for the innocent purpose it suggests.</p>

<p class="BODY">What must have happened was that after forcibly entering <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo's</span> house with the intention of robbing him, <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> suddenly panicked or lost his nerve or otherwise
forgot their original intention and mindlessly shot <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was actually no reason for this as none
of the members of the household had offered any resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having slain <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Liston</span> must have realized the gravity of his act and,
seized by a sudden fear, kicked the kerosene lamp on the floor and took
frightened flight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span>
followed the leader and also escaped.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants' defense of alibi is less than convincing
since they simply corroborated each other with their respective self-serving
allegations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Obaldo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cartagena's</span> testimony is no more persuasive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The distance between his store and the <span class="SpellE">Batidor's</span> house is, as he said, only more than one
kilometer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore not
impossible that the two left his store at the hour he indicated and still had
time to kill <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> a little later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, there is no averment that the
crime was committed at exactly <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight o'clock</st1:time>
that night.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Liston</span> stresses that he demanded a
paraffin test upon his arrest but was not given one and was thus prevented from
proving that he had not fired the fatal gun.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="GramE">Perhaps so, although the result of such test would not be
necessarily conclusive in the light of his positive identification by <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> and Samuel <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may also be that he was bluffing the
police then, but we shall give him the benefit of the doubt as is his due.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We may even concede that, lacking the
assistance of counsel at that time, he could not have insisted on the test nor
could he have sought the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation as
he was already in custody.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the police was remiss in not applying
such test for a more thorough investigation of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the Court does not believe that
the acquittal of the accused-appellants can be pronounced on the basis alone of
such negligence, in disregard of the other evidence of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree that the killing of <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span> was attended with treachery that qualified the
crime to murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim was
completely taken by surprise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Liston</span> insured the commission of the crime without risk to
himself by preventing <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> from taking measures
to defend <span class="GramE">himself</span> against the sudden attack that was
made upon him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The astonished <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> could not even rise from where he was seated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One moment he was peacefully eating with his
family and the next he was dead with a bullet in his heart.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that he was shot face to face did not make the attack
any less treacherous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The important thing
is that he was totally taken aback and rendered completely defenseless when
they shot him dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we have held:</p>

<blockquote>There is treachery although the shooting was frontal, when the
attack was so sudden and unexpected that the victim was not in a position to
offer an effective defense, or when there was a deliberate surprise attack upon
an unarmed victim, or when the attack was unexpected, without warning, and
without giving the victim the chance to defend himself or repel the initial
attack.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court erred, however, in considering the aggravating
circumstances of nighttime and abuse of superior strength as these are absorbed
in <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span> because they facilitated the
commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither should
it have considered disregard of the respect due to age, no evidence having been
introduced to establish this aggravating circumstance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And while P.D. No. 1866 prescribes the
penalty of death if the killing is committed with an unlicensed firearm, there
is no evidence either that the firearm used by <span class="SpellE">Liston</span>
was unlicensed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dwelling was correctly considered a generic aggravating
circumstance as the victim was murdered in his own house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This increased the penalty to the maximum
period, but since death is now no longer allowed under the present Constitution,
it must now be reduced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This would be in accordance with Article III,
Section 19(1) of the Constitution and our ruling in the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
on the effect of the non-imposition of the death penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The Court notes that at the time of the
commission of the crime <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> was only 21 years of
age and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> was not yet 25.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their victim was 53 years old and left a
widow and several children of minor age who must now fend for themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is hoped that they will manage somehow
even without the guidance and help of the head of the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As for the accused-appellants, although they
face a bleak if deserved future, they may still atone for their act and become
useful members of society.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meantime, as co-conspirators equally responsible for the killing
of <span class="SpellE">Cloteldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Batidor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Liston</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span> must serve
their term in prison and are <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable to the
victim's heirs for the civil indemnity, which is increased to P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This latter
penalty is practically ineffective, unfortunately, as the accused-appellants
are practically penniless and cannot improve their fortunes within the prison
walls.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed judgment as above modified is
AFFIRMED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>
