then 17 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She reached only
Grade V (pp. 39, 54, <span class="SpellE">Tiblatin</span>; p. 1, Records).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is the legitimate daughter of the accused
Marcos <span class="SpellE">Clarin</span>, whose wife, complainant's mother, is <span class="SpellE">Rustica</span> <span class="SpellE">Casissid</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">couple have</span> four

refused to allow his daughter to marry said <span class="SpellE">Cumbis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the complainant left their
house to live together with <span class="SpellE">Cumbis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite this development, the parents of the
complainant refused to forgive her and to give consent to her marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, complainant and <span class="SpellE">Cumbis</span>
lived together as common-law husband and wife for a year, more or less (pp.

left the complainant ostensibly to go to Antique for a vacation and never

to her parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, at first,
refused to accept her, but later relented when his wife insisted (pp. 42-43, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tiblatin</span>; p. 14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bael</span>).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

 16, 1973</st1:date>, after the said family had taken their supper, the
accused, in the presence of his wife and sons and said daughter, asked
permission from his wife to allow <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> to sleep
with him at their <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut, <span style="">giving </span>the reason that he usually had bad dreams or nightmares
(pp. 32, 45-47, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tiblatin</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because she was an obedient daughter, <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> consented (pp. 43­-44, 45, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<u>id</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was already <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> that evening when the accused and
his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>, went to the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut, located about one kilometer away from their
house. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>
walked ahead of her father who was following her, holding the lighted lamp or <span class="SpellE"><u>lampara</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also took along a mat and a blanket (pp. 46-48, 49, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon arriving at the said hut, the ac­cused told his daughter
<span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> to go up the hut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> heeded and
went up the hut, by using its two-step stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused followed her up the hut.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once inside, the accused placed the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">lampara</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>in its usual place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut was
then not filled up with tobacco leaves, and there was more room inside for two
or more persons to sleep on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were
tobacco leaves hanging, others were on the floor (pp. <span style="">48-49, 50-51, </span><span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Immediately thereafter, the accused told <span style="">his </span>daughter <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>
to take out or remove her panty, pointing at the same time a knife at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> became
frightened and could not utter anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But she did not obey her father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, accused himself forcibly removed the panty of his daughter while
she was then standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By then, <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> was seized with fear as she saw the knife this
time pointed at her neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She became
nervous and could not do anything <span style="">nor </span>shout
(pp. 33, 49-50, 51-52, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="GramE"><u>id</u></span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having thus removed her panty, the accused
told his daughter to <span class="GramE">lay</span> on the floor, but she
refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused then forcibly held
her hands and pulled her downwards, and made her lie on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not take long for the accused to
remove his pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he <span class="GramE">laid</span> on top of his daughter and forced sexual intercourse
with his daughter who felt some pain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While in the course of the copulation, which lasted "may be an
hour"<span class="GramE">,</span> the accused told his daughter not to cry,
nor to tell anybody about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> then felt the penis of her father ejaculate inside
her genital orifice during the coitus <span style="">(pp.
</span>33, 50, 52-54, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="GramE"><u>id</u></span>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the sexual intercourse, the accused again told his
daughter <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> not to tell her mother, <span class="GramE">nor</span> anybody else, as to what he had just done to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> was crying
then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He assured her that what they had
just done was "no case, because that is (was) like a <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
that has no foot prints".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
further told her daughter that they would do the sexual inter­course again
early dawn because it would be quite dark still and cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> did not
respond to her father's suggestion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, she remonstrated with the accused, asking why he was committing
sexual intercourse with her when she was his daughter (pp. 33, 50, 55, 58-59, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="GramE"><u>id</u></span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All throughout the night, the accused lay
beside her daughter, hugging her, inside the said <span class="SpellE">nipa</span>
hut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>
could not sleep that night as she continued crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt heart­broken because of what her own
father had done to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was shocked
by her experience (pp. 48, 55, 57, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Early the following day, while it was still dark, the accused
asked permission from his daughter <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> that they
do the sexual copulation<span style=""> </span>again,
saying that it was quite cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she
did not consent or give in to his suggestion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She pleaded instead with the accused to pity her because she was <span class="GramE">his own</span> daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused took pity on her and no longer persisted in his intentions (pp. 58, 59,
<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id.</u>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When it was bright enough that morning of <st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1973">February 17, 1973</st1:date>, both the accused and the
complainant left the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut and returned to their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family except the <span class="GramE">accused,</span> then took their breakfast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he left the house and went to the
river to fish the whole day (pp. 33-34, 50-55-56, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<u>id.</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the accused had left
the house, <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> told her mother what her father
had done to her during the night inside the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut
(pp. 56, 59, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id.</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mother cried upon hearing the story of
her daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>
told her mother to devise a way whereby they could bring the accused to the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">poblacion</span></u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span> (pp. 33, 59-60, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

<blockquote><span style="">"At </span>around 2:00
o'clock in the afternoon of the same day, February 17, 1973, both mother and
daughter went to see Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Casidsid</span>, brother of <span class="SpellE">Violenda's</span> mother, at the latter's house, located about one
kilometer away (pp. 10-12, 18-19, 20-21, 60, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id.</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut where

was crying while her mother was telling the story to her uncle Rogelio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter noticed that <span class="SpellE">Violenda's</span>
eyes were swollen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was shocked and
offended upon hear­ing the report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
investigated his niece <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>, and the latter
confirmed her mother's report that she was raped by her father during the night
inside the said <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> also told
her uncle that her father should be arrested for having raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Violenda's</span> mother
informed her brother that the accused was fishing in the river (pp. 11, 18,
21-22, 26-27, 34-35, 61, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id.</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio then suggested that they better give
money to <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> for the latter to invite her father
to attend the <u><span style="">fiesta</span></u> in
the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>
that same day, where the accused could be arrested (pp. 12-13, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id.</u>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rogelio <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Casidsid</span></span><span style=""> then
told complainant </span>and her mother to wait for him in <span style="">his </span>house in the meantime. He then
went to see the barrio captain, Herman <span class="SpellE">Tinapao</span>, at
the latter's house, located about three kilometers away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, Rogelio told the barrio captain about
the incident that befell his niece <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also told the barrio captain about their
plan to invite the accused to go with them to the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tinapao</span> ag­reed, promising to see them there in the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> of <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span> (pp.

<blockquote>"Returning to his house, after seeing the barrio captain,
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Casidsid</span> gave P13.00 to <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>
with instruction for her to invite her father to attend the <u>fiesta</u> in
the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span> of <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>
(pp. 22, 24, 34, 60, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio then sent <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>
to look for her father in the said <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut that
afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused was in his <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut when <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> approached
him and she told him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Tay</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE">,</span>

father from his nearby house (pp. 25-26, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span class="GramE"><u>id</u></span>.).</blockquote>

the report that she was raped by her father the night before inside the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later,
Rogelio and the barrio captain informed the accused that they pass the night at

<blockquote>"Dr. Credo further <span class="GramE">testified that he found
no physical injury on the body of the victim, nor was there pertinent lesion in
the <span class="SpellE">perineal</span> area, that is, between the female organ
(p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>); nor any <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span>
or contusions on the vaginal canal of the female organ (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time of his <span style="">examination </span>of
the said rape victim, the vaginal and cervical smear was found negative of
spermatozoa (pp. 6, 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the said doctor, it was possible
that any spermatozoa in the victim's vagina must have already disappeared or died
since the examination was conducted almost 36 hours after sexual intercourse
(pp. 6, 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Credo further declared that it is
possible for the spermatozoa to live with­in 36 hours, although the life span
of the spermatozoa in the vagina of a woman is only for few hours because it is
acidic in nature (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to Dr. Credo, he asked the victim <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span> <span class="SpellE">Clarin</span> why she came only
for examination on <st1:date month="2" day="18" year="1973">February 18, 1973</st1:date>,
and she told him that she could not get out from the place because she was
guarded and that she could not escape at once (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<u>id</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also was informed by her
that she was not given any good or hard blow but that the accused applied a
dagger against her; hence, she could not move, but that there was no penetration
of the dagger (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.)."<span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief, pp. 3-13).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense is one of simple denial, appellant alleging in effect
that the charge was a pure fabrication, motivated by strong resentment and
hatred of the supposed victim and the latter's mother against him for having
upbraided them for the illicit relations they have been carrying on with their
respective lovers, and by <span style="">their </span>desire
to put him behind bars, so that they would be free to go on with their
viciously immoral and illicit affairs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, he testified that
his wife, at the time the alleged crime was committed, had been going out at
night with one Baling <span class="SpellE">Galon</span>, giving rise to his
strong belief that an illicit relation existed between them, as he in fact
quarreled with her wife about the affair, and that at the time he testified in
court, both were already living together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As for her daughter <span class="SpellE">Violenda</span>, she had left
home also to live with one <span class="SpellE">Alejo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cumbis</span>
in a common-law relationship, but when she was abandoned after over a year, she
went back home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant would have
refused to accept her were it not for his wife's plea to let their daughter
stay with them again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The alleged motive of the
rape victim and the latter's mother for falsely charging appellant with such a
grave offense as could send him not only behind bars but possibly to the
execution chamber, is utterly insufficient to induce the mother of the victim
to consent to her daughter being exposed in a public trial as having been
ravished by her own father, much less would the daughter consent to be so
exposed for the justifiably disapproving attitude of appellant against their
sexual misadventures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant,
particularly, had left behind her the immoral life she lived with a common-law
husband, because the latter abandoned her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had to come back home with nobody to depend upon for care, support
and protection more than her own father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She would be the last person, in her state of being the victim of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">man's </span><span style="">infidelity, </span><span style="">to desire his father's incarceration or possible
execution <span class="GramE">whom</span>, more than anybody else, she could hope
for solace, love and care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she gave a
story of how her father raped her, knowing that by said act, if denounced to
the au­thorities, she might lose him, there can be no question that she had
done so under the compulsion of telling the truth, unable to bear the thought
of having been beastly attacked by </span><span style="">her
</span><span style="">own father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Only her mother might be
said to have some motive to wish appellant to be meted the extreme punishment
under the law, if it was true that she had an illicit affair with another man, </span>as
appellant alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even so, her own
daughter would not con­sent to offer herself as the means of perpetuating such
an af­fair, which is such a grave offense against her father, specially after
she had herself experienced the pain of being a victim of desertion, infidelity
and downright cruelty, and in a manner and under circumstances that would
inflict an indelible blemish on her character and a lifelong disgrace and blot
to her reputation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her predicament of
utter helplessness after being abandoned by an erstwhile common-law husband,
complainant could not have preferred losing his father to a lifelong prison
life, if not death by execution, the one man who could give her lasting
paternal love and care, to allowing her <span style="">mother
unre­strained </span>freedom to an illicit af<span style="">f</span>air, and thereby add moral pain to the physical suffering of
her father while awaiting, in the death row, the end of his <span style="">earthly life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>No person, much less a woman, could attain to such height of
cruelty to one who has sired her, and from whom she thus owes her very
existence, for which she naturally feels lasting and loving gratefulness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her story of having been raped by his own
father, as she gave it under the solemnity of an oath under the gaze of a
public trial could, therefore, not but be the truth, painful though it was to
her in revealing it in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies and contradictions in the testimony
of the victim, as have been very painstakingly pointed out by appellant's <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span><u> </u>counsel, who should be commended
for his zealous and assiduous effort to save his client from the extreme
punishment meted out on him, assuming that they exist more than from mere
imagination, are, therefore, insuf­ficient to erase the firm conviction as to
the truth of the victim's testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These supposed inconsistencies and contradictions could easily be
explained as referring to minor and incon­sequential details, arising from the
frailty of man's memory, not from the falsity of the story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not affect her cre­dibility at all,
on the central fact constituting the very essence of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One subjected to a most shocking experience
is likely to forget the mere attendant circumstances, the mind being focused on
the main and most absorbing act, and memory of the entire event, concentrated
on such act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recollection of incidental
details merely related thereto necessarily becomes faint and sketchy with the
passage of time, being on matters of indecisive importance if not without
material signi­ficance, and on which testimony would, therefore, not be as care­fully
or guardedly given for accuracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">We could pass upon the alleged inconsistencies and
contradictions, by merely saying that as quite satisfactorily demon­strated by
the Solicitor General, they are more apparent than real, and that any rate,
they refer to minor and inconsequential details, not in any way, affecting the
credibility of the com­plainant's main testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, for the satisfaction of <span style="">counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>
whose zeal and industry in the defense of his client deserves commendation, <span class="GramE">We</span> shall pass upon the inconsistency and contradictions
pointed out by him as are worth mentioning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether complainant
had begotten a child or not; (2) whether she was raped twice or only once by
appellant; (3) the time of the meeting with complainant's uncle to plan
appellant's arrest and detention; (4) the precise time and place appellant used
a knife to threaten her daughter; (5) the reason why it took complainant two
days after the incident to go to the hospital for medical examination, and (6)
whether corn or tobacco was stored inside the hut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If complainant told
Dr. Credo that she had begotten a child, but she denied this in Court,
complainant may have done so out of a natural desire and impulse to protect her
honor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would give more credibility
to her story of rape committed against her by her own father, because despite
her natural ten­dency to hide something that would put her to shame, she could not
conceal her having been raped by appellant because the of­fense was too much to
bear and keep to herself.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When complainant
said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"he was doing the sexual
intercourse" at dawn, she could have meant to convey only the idea of
appellant doing the movement of intercourse without there being an actual
insertion, as was done earlier in the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So she stated she was raped only once.</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any discrepancy as to
the time when complainant and her uncle met to plan appellants' arrest and
detention in the municipal jail during the fiesta loses significance because
there was such a plan which was actually put into execution, a fact duly
established and cannot be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of the knife
could have started when com­plainant was going up the hut, and again used to
accomplish ap­pellant's bestial desire once inside the hut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant never declared that it was only
on either place or time, not both, that appellant threatened her with the
knife.</p>

<p class="BODY">(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's reason
for the delay in her going to the hospital for examination that she was guarded
is not a lie, for just because her father went to fish the morning following
the incident, gave her no assurance that he would not come back soon enough to
prevent her from going to the doctor, as she knew appellant would certainly
suspect her purpose should she go out of the house just after she had been
raped.</p>

<p class="BODY">(6)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only Herman <span class="SpellE">Tinapao</span> testified that the hut contained corn, but this
does not necessarily mean that complainant told him that corn was stored in the
hut, not tobacco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mistake is
evidently that of <span class="SpellE">Tinapao</span> which should not affect
complainant's credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing is an objective analysis of the supposed in­consistencies
and contradictions committed by complainant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are convinced that they are not that serious as counsel would make of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are no proofs of
complainant's lack of sincerity and candor in giving her story of rape
committed by her father against her, as to cast doubt or suspicion on the
veracity of her testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">One fact that should not escape attention for a proper
appreciation of its significance is the presentation of appellant's son, <span class="SpellE">Marianito</span> <span class="SpellE">Clarin</span> as a defense
witness, but he wilted under the pressure of the heavy thought, as he said so
in court, that what his father had done was bad, and so he and the other
children of appellant would not testify in his favor to gain his acquittal (p.
62, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., March 9, 1977, <span class="SpellE">Bael</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's own son would not have uttered
those words with tears in his eyes, unless he was convinced that his father s<span style="">o </span>gravely offended his sister that he
would not even lift a finger to save his father from the punishment that he
deserves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By his words and conduct, he
had strongly fortified belief in the truth of his sister's sad story.</p>

<p class="BODY">The willingness of complainant to face investigators and to
submit to a physical examination by a medico-legal <span class="GramE">officer,</span>
is a mute but eloquent testimony of the truth of her accusation against her
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she was merely asked to
narrate a fab­ricated story to build up a serious charge of rape against
appellant, she would recoil at the possibility of being caught in her
prevarication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She should feel deterred
by the grave consequences of such <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> falsehoods
which could easily be un­masked as such by the medical findings that would be
made after a thorough examination on her body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was the truth of her story that gave her the courage and boldness
fearlessly to face interrogation, and medical examination, both effective means
of verifying the truth of her serious accusation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Speaking of veracity of a rape victim's story, this Court, in
People vs. Daniels, 86 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>, 511, 527, had occasion
to observe:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant assails the veracity of the tes­timony of the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what possible motive
could a thirteen-year old girl barely in her teens have in fabricating a story
that could only bring down on her and her family shame and humiliation and make
her an object of gossip and curiosity among her classmates and the people of
her hometown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied that a
public trial involving a crime of this nature subjects the victim to what can
be a harrowing experience of submitting to a physical examination of her body,
an investigation by police authorities, appearance in court for the hearing
where she has to unravel lewd and hideous details of a painful event which she
would prefer to forget and leave it unknown to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Margarita did forego all these and
preferred to face the cruel realities of the situa<span style="">t</span>ion it was due to her simple and natural instincts of speaking
out the truth."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above observation can
aptly be applied as affording an accurate means of testing the veracity of the
testimony of the complainant - the lack of motive to testify falsely specially
against a </span><span style="">loved one, and the
ease and facility by which her falsehood could be discovered as </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">deter her </span><span style="">from making
such a grave accusation as that of rape against her own father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled rule that for the lone and uncorro­borated
testimony of the offended party to be sufficient to convict for the crime of
rape, it must be clear and free from any serious contradiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her story must be impeccable and must ring
throughout or bear the stamp of absolute truth and candor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. Lacuna, 87 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
364; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dazo</span>, et al., 58 Phil. 420; People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Nebres</span>, 58 Phil. 903; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ariarte</span>, 60 Phil. 326; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Delfinado</span>,
61 Phil. 694.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A perusal of the
testimony of the offended party, and a careful scrutiny thereof, convinces <span class="GramE">Us</span> that same was given with sincerity and candor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It leaves no room for the slightest doubt
that it is not a mere fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have no hesitation to accept it after finding it so clear and credible against
the mere denial of the appellant who has shown no motive on the part of her own
daughter, which must be powerful in the extreme, to accuse him of such a grave
offense, even at the sacrifice of losing her own father to a lifelong
incarceration or perhaps death by execution, with her brothers and sisters, if
not her mother, sharing, even more painfully, in the same sacrifice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> We agree with the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>that the guilt of appellant for the crime charged has been
established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For

the trial court is hereby reduced to <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, </span>and
