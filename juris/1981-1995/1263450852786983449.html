				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The complaint for disbarment filed against respondent Angel S.
Huertas, former Municipal Judge of Ragay, Camarines Sur, was based on his
having allegedly falsified the information sheet which the Commission on
Appointments required as a prerequi足site to the confirmation of his appointment
as muni足cipal judge.  More specifically,
he was accused of stating in his information sheet that he had no previous
administrative case, when in truth and in fact the Civil Service Board of
Appeals had affirmed a decision finding him guilty of dishonesty (falsifi足cation
of daily time records) and gross misconduct, <span style="">for which he was dismissed from the government service, when he was
then Senior Inspector of the Fiber Inspec足tion Service.  In his Answer, respondent specifically
denied such allegation, "the truth of the matter," according to him,
"being that the Civil Service Board of Appeals confirmed <i>[</i>his<i>]</i>
dismissal by the Fiber </span>Inspection Service, which confirmation came after
the City Fiscal of the City of Manila dismissed the criminal case filed by the
Fiber Inspection Service against the respondent for falsification, the same
charge of which he was accused by the Fiber Inspection Service in an
administrative charge and which dismissal of said criminal case extinguished
the respondent's criminal and civil liabilities."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was then referred to the Solicitor General for his
investigation, report, and recommendation.  In the Report submitted to this Court on September 15, 1981, the
recommendation was for the complaint to be dismissed for becoming moot and
academic, respondent having had suffered an attack of coronary thrombosis which
caused his death.  Reliance was placed
on the following cases: Fule v. Cordero;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
