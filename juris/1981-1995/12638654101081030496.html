				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 501-V of the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> (Branch III, Valenzuela) -- which was an action for
partition and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> instituted by Maxima,
Francisca, and Francisco, all surnamed Francisco, together with their
respective spouses, against <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Lorenza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>, all also
surnamed Francisco, and <span style="">their respective
spouses -- </span>judgment was rendered on August 11, 1971 by Judge Juan de <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered declaring Maxima
Francisco entitled to 138 square meters and Francisca Francisco to 126 square
meters from the portion sold to<b> </b><span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>
Francisco, and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Francisco</span> to 360 square
meters from the portion sold to <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> Francisco at a
price of P11.00 per square meter, <i><u>the same to be paid within thirty (30)</u></i><u>
<i>days after this decision becomes final, otherwise plaintiffs shall lose all
their rights to said portion</i></u>, and after payment shall have been made
defendants shall execute the proper deeds of conveyance in favor of
plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * *." (Emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in a decision
promulgated on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1975</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
No appeal was attempted from the Appellate Court's decision which consequently
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1975</st1:date>, and was remanded to the Trial
Court for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1976</st1:date>,
the plaintiffs filed a motion for execution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion was denied by respondent Judge, Hon. Crispin V. Bautista, by
Order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1976</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
His Honor ruled that since the judgment had given the plaintiffs thirty (30)
days from finality of decision within which to pay to the defendants the price
of the areas respectively awarded to them at the rate of P11.00 per square
meter; and since considerably more than thirty (30) days had elapsed since the
decision of the Court of Appeals, affirming that of the Trial Court, had become
final, said plaintiffs had, in accordance with the judgment, lost "all
their rights" to their portions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge however later reconsidered and set aside his
Order of <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1976</st1:date>,
on motion of the plaintiffs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This he did
in an Order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1976</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In said Order, he declared that upon the facts, the failure of the plaintiffs
to effect payment within the appointed time could not <span class="GramE">ascribed</span>
to their fault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Honor found that -</p>

<blockquote>" * * plaintiffs'
attempt to tender payment in accordance with the decision of this Court which
the Court of Appeals affirmed on September 16, 1975 failed to materialize
because plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> Francisco and his wife
were in the United States and defendant <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>
Francisco to whom plaintiffs rendered payment refused the same which resulted
in their <span style="">failure </span>to comply with
their obligation to pay within the period of thirty (30) days provided for in
the decision, the Court considers plaintiffs' attempt to tender payment
sufficient to <span style="">comply with </span>their
undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Art. 1186 of the New Civil
Code provides that ‘the <span style="">condition shall
be deemed fulfilled when the obligor voluntarily prevents its
fulfillment.’"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge accordingly RESOLVED -</p>

<blockquote>" * * to set aside
** (the) Order of February 2, 1976 and plaintiffs are given a period of fifteen
(15) days from receipt or this Order within which to tender payment to the
defendants and/or deposit <span style="">with the
Office of the Clerk of Court the amount corresponding to </span>the value of
the parcel of land subject matter of this case after the same is segregated
from the portion belonging to the defendants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendants moved, in their turn, for reconsideration of the
Order of <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was seasonably opposed by the
plaintiffs, and thereafter denied by Judge Bautista, by Order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is these Orders of April 14, and July 2,
1976 that the petitioners would have this Court annul in the special civil
action of <i>certiorari </i>at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners theorize that in rendering the Order of <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1976</st1:date>, respondent Judge had
acted with grave abuse of discretion because he had in effect substantially
altered the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment of his
predecessor, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well settled that a court has plenary power to alter,
modify or even set aside, its own decisions, and even order a new trial, at any
time before the decision becomes final, or before an appeal from that decision
has been perfected.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
However, after the decision has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
it can no longer be amended or corrected by the court except for clerical
errors or mistakes.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This principle of immutability of judgments already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> has invariably been adhered to by this Court
regardless of any occasional injustice, for the equity of a particular case
must yield to the "overmastering need" of certainty and <span class="SpellE">unalterability</span> of judicial pronouncements.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Any amendment or alteration which substantially affects a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment is null and void for lack of
jurisdiction, including the entire proceedings held for that purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It is these principles that petitioners invoke to nullify the questioned orders
of the respondent Judge in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The facts here and the applicable principles, however, preclude such
relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">A distinction should be made between the jurisdiction of the
court to amend, modify or alter its judgment and its power to enforce it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former ceases to attach when the judgment
becomes final, while ordinarily, the latter exists precisely after the judgment
has become final for the purpose of its execution,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the propriety of its exercise rather than the jurisdiction to amend or modify
being the real issue here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, in the
execution proceedings in question, the court <i>a quo </i>found as a fact that
plaintiffs were prevented from consummat<span style="">i</span>ng
the requisite tender of payment due to the absence o<span style="">f</span> two of the defendants from the Philippines and the refusal of
the third to accept such tender which, it is not seriously disputed, was
attempted within the prescribed 30-day period from finality of the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no cogent reason to
disturb that factual conclusion, which therefore is binding and conclusive upon
this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has held in several cases<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
that where a timely and valid tender of payment is made pursuant to the
exercise of a right (not an obligation) it is sufficient, without consignation,
to preserve such right.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Vda</i></span><i>. de <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Palarca</span></i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
it was ruled that consignation referred to in Article 1256 of the Civil Code is
inapplicable to a lease with option to buy because said provision refers to
consignation as one of the means for the payment or discharge of a “debt,"
whereas the lessee was not indebted to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> for
the price of the leased premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lessee merely exercised a right of option and had no<span style=""> </span>obligation to pay said price until execution of the deed of sale
in his favor, which the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> refused to do.</p>

<p class="BODY">And in the fairly recent case of <span class="SpellE"><i>Legaspi</i></span><i>
v. Court of Appeals</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which involved the exercise of the right t<span style="">o</span>
repurchase, the Court also held that -</p>

<blockquote>"* * In instances where no debt is due and owing, consignation
is not proper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have ruled early that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Consignation is not required to preserve the right of repurchase
as a mere tender of payment is enough if made on time as a basis for an action
to compel the vendee <i>a</i> <i><span style="">retro </span></i>to
resell the property.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since the case at bar involves the exercise of the right to
repurchase, a showing that petitioner made valid tender of payment is
sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that sincere or
genuine tender of payment and not a mock or deserve one was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he deposited the amount of repurchase
money with the Clerk of Court was simply an additional security for the <span style="">petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not an essential act that had to be performed after tender of
payment was refused by the private respondent although it may serve to indicate
the veracity of desire to comply with the obligation."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The tender having been made, not so much to discharge an
obligation as to enforce or exercise a right (to a <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of the portions of law adjudged to them), no subsequent consignation was
necessary to entitle the private respondents to such <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the respondent Judge committed no
grave abuse of discretion in setting aside his Order of February 2, 1976 and
giving said respondents a new period within which to tender payment to the
petitioner and/or deposit the required amount in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may even be said that in view of the efficacy
of said tender for the purpose of enforcing a <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
the grant of a fresh period within which to reiterate the same is superfluous
and unnecessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as previously shown, the rights and obligations of the
parties arose from a judgment, not from contract and therefore the Civil Code
requirements as to consignation are not applicable.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in case of refusal of a tender of the amount due on a judgment, the court
may direct the money to be paid in court and when this is done, order satisfaction
of the judgment to be entered<span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The tender of payment of a judgment is
not the same as tender of payment of a contractual debt and consignation of the
money due from a debtor to a creditor.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The requisites of consignation under Art. 1256 <i><span style="">et seq. </span></i>do not<span style=""> </span>apply
to the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appearing that private respondents have already deposited with
the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance (now RTC) of
Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, the sum of P6,864.00 in
accordance with the order of the court <i><span style="">a
