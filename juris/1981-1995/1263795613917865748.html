<p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision of the respondent 
Intermediate Appellate Court in A.C. G.R. <span>CV No. 66502 </span>entitled 
"<em>Governor Rene Espina, et. al. v. Mayor Sergio Osmena, Jr., et. al., Atty. 
Pablo P. Garcia v. Province of Cebu</em>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> affirming with modification the order of 
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch VII, 
granting respondent Pablo P. Garcia's claim for comp<span>ensation </span>for 
services rendered as counsel in behalf of the respondent Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are not in dispute.<span>&nbsp; </span>On 
February 4, 1964, while then incumbent Governor Rene <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> was on official business in Manila, the 
Vice-Governor, <span class="SpellE">Priscillano</span> <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and three (3) members of the Provincial Board 
enacted Resolution No. 188, donating to the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 210 province-owned lots all located in the City of 
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, with an aggregate area of over 380 hectares, and 
authorizing the Vice-Governor to sign the deed of <span>donation </span>on 
behalf of the province.<span>&nbsp; </span>The deed of donation was immediately 
executed in behalf of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> by 
Vice-Governor <span class="SpellE">Almendras</span> and accepted in behalf of the 
City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> by Mayor Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span>, Jr.<span>&nbsp; </span>The document of donation was 
prepared and notarized by a private lawyer.<span>&nbsp; </span>The donation was later 
approved by the Office of the President through Executive Secretary Juan <span class="SpellE">Cancio</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">According to the questioned deed of donation the lots donated were 
to be <span class="GramE">sold</span> by the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> to raise funds that would be 
used to finance its public improvement projects.<span>&nbsp; </span>The City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> was 
given a period of one (1) year from <st1:date month="8" day="15" year="1964">August 15, 1964</st1:date> within which to dispose of the donated 
lots.</p>
<p class="BODY">Upon his return from Manila, Governor <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> denounced as illegal and immoral the action of his 
colleagues in donating practically all the patrimonial property of the province 
of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, considering that the latter's income was less 
than one-fourth (¼) of that of the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">To prevent the sale or disposition of the lots, the officers and 
members of the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Mayor's League (in behalf of their 
respective municipalities) along with some taxpayers, including Atty. Garcia, 
filed a case seeking to have the donation declared illegal, null, and 
void.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was alleged in the complaint that the plaintiffs were 
filing it for and in behalf of the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> in the nature of a 
derivative suit.<span>&nbsp; </span>Named defendants in the suit were the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>, City 
Mayor Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span>, Jr. and the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> provincial officials responsible for the 
donation of the province-owned lots.<span>&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as 
Civil Case No. R-8669 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and assigned to Branch VI thereof.</p>
<p class="BODY"><st1:place><st1:placename>Defendants</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> and City Mayor <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span>, Jr. filed a motion to dismiss the case on the ground 
that plaintiffs did not have the legal capacity to sue.</p>
<p class="BODY">Subsequently, in an order, dated May, 1965, the court dismissed 
Case No. <span class="GramE">R-8669 on the ground that plaintiffs were not the 
real parties in interest in the case.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs filed a 
motion for reconsideration of the order of dismissal.<span>&nbsp; </span>This motion 
was denied by the Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Mayor Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span>, Jr. announced that he would borrow funds from the 
Philippine National Bank (PNB) and would use the donated lots as 
collaterals.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <span>July, </span>1965, the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city> 
advertised the sale of <span>all </span>the lots remaining unsold.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">Thereupon, Governor <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>, 
apprehensive that the lots would be irretrievably lost by the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Province</span></st1:placetype><span class="GramE"> of 
</span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cebu</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE">, 
decided to go to court.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>He engaged the services of 
respondent Garcia in filing and prosecuting the case in his behalf and in behalf 
of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Garcia filed the complaint for the annulment of the deed of 
donation with an application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary 
injunction, which application was granted on the same day, <st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1965">August 6, 1965</st1:date>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The complaint was later amended to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City Mayor Carlos P. 
<span class="SpellE">Cuizon</span> as additional defendant in view of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Numeriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Capangpangan’s</span> 
manifestation stating that on <st1:date month="9" day="9" year="1965">September 
9, 1965</st1:date>, Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span>, Jr. filed his 
certificate of candidacy for senator, his position/office having been assumed by 
City Mayor Carlos P. <span class="SpellE">Cuizon</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Sometime <span>in </span>1972, the Provincial Board passed a 
resolution authorizing the Provincial Attorney, Alfredo G. <span class="SpellE">Baguia</span>, to enter his appearance for the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and for the incumbent 
Governor, Vice-Governor and members of the Provincial Board in this case.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1973">January 30, 
1973</st1:date>, Alfredo G. <span class="SpellE">Baguia</span>, Provincial 
Attorney of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, 
entered his appearance as additional counsel for the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and as counsel for Governor

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1973">January 31, 
1973</st1:date>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Baguia</span> filed a complaint in 
intervention stating that <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">intervenors</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place> of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> and Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> were joining or uniting with original plaintiff, former 
Governor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Rene <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They adopted his causes of action, 
claims, and position stated in the original complaint filed before the court on 
<st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1965">August 6, 1965</st1:date>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="25" year="1974">June 25, 
1974</st1:date>, a compromise agreement was reached between the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and the city of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="7" day="15" year="1974">July 15, 1974</st1:date>, the court approved the 
compromise agreement and a decision was rendered on its basis.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="12" day="4" year="1974">December 4, 
1974</st1:date>, the court issued an order directing the issuance of a writ of 
execution to implement the decision dated <st1:date month="7" day="15" year="1974">July 15, 1974</st1:date>, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>“1<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ordering</span> the City of

<blockquote>“3.<span>&nbsp; </span>Declaring the retention by the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> of the eleven (11) lots mentioned in paragraph No. 1 of 
the compromise agreement, namely, Lot Nos. 1141, 1261, 1268, 1269, 1272, 1273,

<p class="BODY">For services rendered in Civil Case No. 238-BC, CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, respondent Pablo P. Garcia filed through counsel a 
Notice of Attorney's Lien, dated <st1:date month="4" day="14" year="1975">April 
14, 1975</st1:date>, praying that his statement of claim of attorney's lien in 
said case be entered upon the records thereof, pursuant to Section 37, Rule 138 
of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">To said notice, 
<st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place> of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> filed through counsel, its opposition dated 
<st1:date month="4" day="23" year="1975">April 23, 1975</st1:date>, stating that 
the payment of attorney's fees and reimbursement of incidental expenses are not 
allowed by law and settled jurisprudence to be paid by the Province.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>A rejoinder to this opposition was filed by private respondent 
Garcia.</p>
<p class="BODY">After hearing, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, then presided over by Judge Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Marigomen</span>, rendered judgment dated <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1979">May 30, 1979</st1:date>, in favor of private respondent and 
against <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place> of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, declaring that the former is entitled to 
recover attorney's fees on the basis of <em>quantum meruit</em> and fixing the 
amount thereof at P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed from the decision to the Court of 
Appeals.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the case of private respondent, however, he appealed 
only from that portion of the decision which fixed his attorney's fees at 
P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> instead of at 30% of the value of the 
properties involved in the litigation as stated in his original claim.</p>
<p class="BODY">On October 18, 1985, the Intermediate Appellate Court rendered a 
decision affirming the findings and conclusions of the trial court that the 
private respondent is entitled to recover attorney's fees but fixing the amount 
of such fees at 5% of the market value of the properties involved in the 
litigation as of the date of the filing of the claim in 1975.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
<span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision reads:</p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, except for the aforementioned <span class="SpellE">modication</span> that the compensation for the services rendered 
by the Claimant Atty. Pablo P. Garcia is fixed at five percent (5%) of the total 
fair market value <span>of </span>the lots in question, the order appealed from 
is hereby affirmed in all other respects."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Both parties went to the Supreme Court with private respondent 
questioning the fixing of his attorney's fees at 5% instead of 30% of the value 
of the properties in litigations as prayed for in his claims. However, the 
private respondent later withdrew his petition in G.R. No. 72818 with the 
following explanation:</p>
<blockquote>"That after a long and serious reflection and reassessment of his 
position and intended course of action and, after seeking the views of his 
friends, petitioner has come to the definite conclusion that prosecuting his 
appeal would only result in further delay in the final disposition of his claim 
(it has been pending for the last 10 years — 4 in the CFI and 6 in the Court of 
Appeals, later Intermediate Appellate Court) and that it would be more prudent 
and practicable to accept in full the decision of the Intermediate Appellate 
Court."</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">Hence, only the petition of the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> is pending before this 
Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">The matter of representation of a municipality by a private 
attorney has been settled in <em>Ramos v. Court of Appeals</em> (108 SCRA 
728).<span>&nbsp; </span>Collaboration of a private law firm with the fiscal and the 
municipal attorney is not allowed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Section 1683 of the Revised 
Administrative Code provides:</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1683.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Duty of fiscal to represent provinces and provincial subdivisions in 
litigation.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— The provincial fiscal shall represent the 
province and any municipality, or municipal district thereof in any court, 
except in cases whereof original jurisdiction is vested in the Supreme Court or 
in cases where the <span class="GramE">municipality,</span> or municipal district 
in question is a party adverse to the provincial government or to some other 
municipality, or municipal district in the same province.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the 
interests of a provincial government and of any political division thereof are 
opposed, the provincial fiscal shall act on behalf of the province.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"When the provincial fiscal is disqualified to serve any 
municipality or other political subdivision of a province, a special attorney 
may be employed by its council."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The above provision, complemented by Section 3 of the Local 
Autonomy Law, is clear in providing that only the provincial fiscal and the 
municipal attorney can represent a province or municipality in its 
lawsuits.<span>&nbsp; </span>The provision is mandatory.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
municipality's authority to employ <span>a </span>private lawyer is expressly 
limited only to situations where the provincial fiscal <span>is 
</span>disqualified to represent it (<em>De Guia v. The Auditor 
General</em><span class="GramE">, 44 SCRA 169; <em>Municipality of Bocaue, et al. 
v. Manotok</em>, 93 Phil. 173; <em>Enriquez, Sr., v. Honorable Gimenez,</em> 107 
Phil. 932) <span>as </span>when he represents the province against a 
municipality.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The lawmaker, in requiring that the local government should be 
represented in its court cases by a government lawyer, like its municipal 
attorney and the provincial fiscal, intended that the local government should 
not be burdened with the expenses of hiring a private lawyer.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
lawmaker also assumed that the interests of the municipal corporation would be 
best protected if a government lawyer handles its litigations.<span>&nbsp; </span>It 
is to be expected that the municipal attorney and the fiscal would be faithful 
and dedicated to the corporation's interests, and that, as civil service 
employees, they could be held accountable for any misconduct or dereliction of 
duty (See <em>Ramos v. Court of Appeals, supra</em>).</p>
<p class="BODY">However, every rule is not without an exception, <span class="SpellE"><em>Ibi</em></span><em> quid generaliter</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>conceditur</em></span><em>; inest</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>haec</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>exceptio</em></span><em>, si non aliquid sit contra jus 
fasque</em> (Where anything is granted generally, this exception <span>is 
</span>implied; that nothing shall he contrary to law and right).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Indeed, equity, as well as the exceptional situation facing us in the 
case at bar, require a departure from the established 
rule.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioner anchors its opposition to private respondent's 
claim for compensation on the grounds that the employment of claimant as counsel 
for the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> by then Governor Rene <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> was unauthorized and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 1681 to 1683 in relation to Section 
1679 of the Revised Administrative Code and that the claim for attorney's fees 
is beyond the purview of Section 37, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is argued that Governor <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> was 
not authorized by the Provincial Board, through a board resolution, to employ 
Atty. Pablo P. Garcia as counsel of the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Admittedly, this is so.</p>
<p class="BODY">However, the circumstances obtaining in the case at bar are such 
that the rule cannot be applied.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Provincial Board would never 
have given such authorization.<span>&nbsp; </span>The decision of the respondent 
court elucidates <span>the </span>matter thus:</p>
<blockquote>"xxx The provisions of Sections 1681 to 1683 of the Revised 
Administrative Code contemplate a normal situation where the adverse party of 
the province is a third person as <span>in </span>the case of <em>Enriquez v. 
Auditor General</em>, 107 Phil. 932.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the 
controversy <span>involved </span>an intramural fight between the Provincial 
Governor on one hand and the members of the Provincial Board on the other 
hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>Obviously it is unthinkable for the Provincial Board to 
adopt a resolution authorizing the Governor to employ Atty. Garcia to act as 
counsel for the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> for the purpose of 
filing and prosecuting a case against the members to the same Provincial 
Board.<span>&nbsp; </span>According to the claimant Atty. Garcia, how can Governor 
<span class="SpellE">Espina</span> <span class="GramE">be</span> expected to secure 
authority from the Provincial Board to employ claimant as counsel for the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> when the very officials 
from whom authority is to be sought are the same officials to be sued.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It is simply impossible that the Vice-Governor <span>and </span><span>the 
members of the </span><span>Provincial Board </span>would pass a resolution 
authorizing Governor <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> to hire a lawyer to file a 
suit against <span class="GramE">themselves</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<table align="center" border="0" width="60%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="33%"><span class="GramE">xxx</span></td>
<td width="34%">
<div align="center">xxx<span></span></div></td>
<td width="33%">
<div align="right"><span></span>xxx</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Under Section 2102 of the Revised Administrative Code it is the 
Provincial Board upon <span class="GramE">whom</span> is vested the authority 'to 
direct, in its discretion, the bringing or defense of civil suits on behalf of 
the Provincial Governor _____’.<span>&nbsp; </span>Considering that the members of 
the Provincial Board are the very ones involved in this case, they cannot be 
expected to direct the Provincial Fiscal the filing of the suit on behalf of the 
provincial government against themselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as argued by 
the claimant, even if the Provincial Fiscal should side with the Governor in the 
bringing of this suit, the Provincial Board whose members are made defendants in 
this <span class="GramE">case,</span> can simply frustrate his efforts by 
directing him to dismiss the case or by refusing to appropriate funds for the 
expenses of the litigation.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"xxx Consequently, there could have been no occasion for the 
exercise by the Provincial Fiscal of his powers and duties since the members of 
the Provincial Board would not have directed him to file a suit against 
them.”</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">A situation obtains, therefore, where the Provincial Governor, in 
behalf of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, seeks 
redress against the very members of the body, that is, the Provincial Board, 
which, under the law, is to provide it with legal assistance.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 
strict application of the provisions of the Revised Administrative Code on the 
matter would deprive the plaintiffs in the court below of redress for a valid 
grievance.<span>&nbsp; </span>The provincial board <span>authorization 
</span>required by law to secure the services of special counsel becomes <span class="GramE">an impossibility</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The decision of the 
respondent court is grounded in equity — a correction applied to law, where on 
account of the general comprehensiveness of the law, particular exceptions not 
being provided against, something <span class="GramE">is wanting</span> to render 
it perfect.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is also argued that the employment of claimant was <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of sections 1681 to 1683 of the Revised 
Administrative Code because the Provincial Fiscal who was the only competent 
official to file this case was not disqualified to act for the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent counsel's representation of the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> became necessary because of 
the Provincial Board's failure or refusal to direct the bringing of the action 
to recover the properties it had donated to the City of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Board more 
effectively disqualified the Provincial Fiscal from representing the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> when it directed the Fiscal 
to appear for its members in Civil Case No. R-8669 filed by Atty. Garcia, and 
others, to defend its actuation in passing and approving Provincial Board 
Resolution No. 186.<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer of the Provincial Fiscal on behalf 
of the Vice-Governor and the Provincial Board members filed in Civil Case No. 
R-8669, (Exhibit "K") upholds the validity and legality of the donation.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>How then could the Provincial Fiscal represent the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> in the suit to recover the 
properties in question?<span>&nbsp; </span>How could Governor <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> be represented by the Provincial Fiscal or seek 
authorization from the Provincial Board to employ special counsel?<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE"><em>Nemo</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>tenetur</em></span> <em>ad impossibile</em> (The law obliges no 
one to perform an impossibility).<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither could a prosecutor be 
designated by the Department of Justice.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Malacanang</span> had already approved the questioned donation.</p>
<p class="BODY">Anent the question of liability for respondent counsel's services, 
the general rule that an attorney cannot recover his fees from one who did not 
employ him or authorize his employment, is subject to its own exception.</p>
<p class="BODY">Until the contrary is clearly shown, an attorney is presumed to be 
acting under authority of the litigant whom he purports to represent (<em>Azotes 
v. Blanco</em>, 78 Phil. 739) His authority to appear for and represent 
petitioner in litigation, not having been questioned in the lower court, it will 
be presumed on appeal that counsel was properly authorized to file the complaint 
and appear for his client.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>Republic v. Philippine Resources 
Development Corporation</em>, 102 Phil. 960) Even where an attorney is employed 
by an unauthorized person to represent a client, the latter will be bound where 
it has knowledge of the fact that it is being represented by an attorney in a 
particular litigation and takes no prompt measure to repudiate the assumed 
authority.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such acquiescence in the employment of an attorney as 
occurred in this case is tantamount to ratification (<em>Tan Lua v. 
O'Brien</em>, 55 Phil. 53).<span>&nbsp; </span>The act of the successor provincial 
board and provincial officials in allowing respondent Atty. Pablo P. Garcia to 
continue as counsel and in joining him in the suit led the counsel to believe 
his services were still necessary.</p>
<p class="BODY">We apply a rule in the law of municipal corporations, "that a 
municipality may become obligated upon an implied contract to pay the reasonable 
value of the benefits accepted or appropriated by it as to which it has the 
general power to contract.<span>&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of implied municipal 
liability has been said to apply to all cases where money or other property of a 
party is received under such circumstances that the general law, independent of 
express contract implies an obligation upon the municipality to do justice with 
respect to the same." <span class="GramE">(38 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.</span> Sec. 515, p. 193):</p>
<blockquote>"The obligation of a municipal corporation upon the doctrine of an 
implied contract does not connote an enforceable obligation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some 
specific principle or situation of which equity takes cognizance must be the 
foundation of the claim.<span>&nbsp; </span>The principle of liability rests upon the 
theory that the obligation implied by <span>law </span>to pay does not originate 
in the unlawful contract, but arises from considerations outside it.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The measure of recovery <span>is </span>the benefit received by the 
municipal corporation.<span>&nbsp; </span>The amount of the loan, the value of the 
property or services, or the compensation specified in the contract, is not the 
measure.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the price named in the invalid contract <span>is 
</span>shown to be entirely fair and reasonable not only in view of the labor 
done, but also in reference to the benefits conferred, it may be taken as the 
true measure of recovery."</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">The petitioner can not set up the plea 
that the contract was <em>ultra vires</em> and still retain benefits <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having regarded the contract as 
valid for purposes of reaping some benefits, the petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to question its validity for the purposes of 
denying answerability.</p>
<p class="BODY">The trial court discussed the services of respondent Garcia as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"xxx Thus because of his effort in the filing of this case and in 
securing the issuance of the injunction preventing the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span>, Jr., from 
selling or disposing the lots to third parties, on the part of the members of 
the Provincial Board from extending the date of the automatic reversion beyond 
August 15, 1965, on the part of the Register of Deeds — from effecting the 
transfer of title of any of the donated lots to any vendee or transferee, the 
disposition of these lots by the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> to third 
parties was frustrated and thus:<span>&nbsp; </span>saved these lots for their 
eventual recovery by the province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>."</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">Actually it was Governor <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> who filed the case against 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and Mayor <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Garcia just happened to be the 
lawyer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Still Atty. Garcia is entitled to compensation.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>To deny private respondent compensation for his professional services 
would amount to a deprivation of property without due process of law (<span class="SpellE"><em>Cristobal</em></span><em> v. Employees' Compensation 
Commission</em>, 103 SCRA 329).</p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioner alleges that although they do not deny Atty. 
Garcia's services for Governor <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> (who ceased to 
be such Governor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> on September 13, 1969) and 
the original plaintiffs in the case, "it cannot be said with candor and fairness 
that were it not for his services the lots would have already been lost to the 
province forever, because the donation itself he was trying to enjoin and annul 
in said case was subject to a reversion clause under which lots remaining <span class="SpellE">undisposed</span> of by the City as of August 15, 1965 
automatically reverted to the province and only about 17 lots were disposed of 
by August 15, 1965." We quote respondent counsel's comment with approval:</p>
<blockquote>
<table align="center" border="0" width="60%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="33%"><span class="GramE">xxx</span></td>
<td width="34%">
<div align="center">xxx<span></span></div></td>
<td width="33%">
<div align="right"><span></span>xxx</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<blockquote>"While it is true that the donation was subject to a reversion 
clause, the same clause gave the Provincial Board the discretion to extend the 
period of reversion beyond <st1:date month="8" day="15" year="1965">August 15, 
1965</st1:date> (see paragraph 3 of donation).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"With the known predisposition of the majority of the members of the 
Provincial Board, there would have been no impediment to the extension of the 
reversion date to beyond <st1:date month="8" day="15" year="1965">August 15, 
1965</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once the date of reversion is extended, the 
disposition of all the donated lots would be only a matter of 
course."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">We have carefully reviewed the records of this case and conclude 
that 30% or even 5% of properties already worth P120<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> in 1979 as compensation for the private 
respondent's services is simply out of the question.<span>&nbsp; </span>The case 
handled by Atty. Garcia was decided on the basis of a compromise agreement where 
he no longer participated.<span>&nbsp; </span>The decision was rendered after 
pre-trial and without any hearing on the merits.</p>
<p class="BODY">The factual findings and applicable law in this petition are 
accurately discussed in the exhaustive and well-written Order of then Trial 
Judge, now Court of Appeals Justice Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Marigomen</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We agree with his determination of 
reasonable fees for the private lawyer <span>on </span>the <span>basis </span>of 
<em>quantum meruit</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court fixed the compensation at 
P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and ordered reimbursement of actual expenses 
in the amount of P289.43.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned <st1:date month="10" day="18" year="1985">October 18, 1985</st1:date> decision of the Intermediate Appellate
