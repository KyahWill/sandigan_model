				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The decision of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
Branch 133 dated <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1987</st1:date>,
convicting Mario <span class="SpellE">Tandoy</span> of the crime of violation of
Art. II, <span style="">Sec. </span>4 of Rep. Act No.
6425 known <span style="">as </span>the Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1972, <span style="">is </span>before us
on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The information against
the accused-appellant read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 27th day of May 1986, in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused without being
authorized by law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
sell eight (8) pieces of dried marijuana flowering tops, two (2) pieces of
dried marijuana flowering tops and crushed dried marijuana flowering tops,
which are prohibited drug, for and in consideration of P20.00.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, <span class="SpellE">Tandoy</span> entered a plea
of not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After trial, Judge
Buenaventura J. Guerrero rendered a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which declared:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court finds Mario <span class="SpellE">Tandoy</span> y
Lim guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Sec. 4, Art. II, Rep. Act
No. 6425, as amended, and is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay a
fine of P20,000.00 and cost.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The marijuana confiscated in this case is declared confiscated and
forfeited and ordered turned over to the Dangerous Drugs Board for proper
disposal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accuse-appellant raises the following assignment of errors in
this appeal:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court a quo erred in
finding accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged despite
lack of evidence to prove that he sold marijuana to the poseur-buyer.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court a quo erred in
admitting in evidence against the accused <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"E-2-A" which is merely a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of the
P10.00 bill allegedly used as buy-bust money.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1986</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30 p.m.</st1:time>, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Salido</span>, Jr. of the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Police
Station dispatched Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Herino</span> de la Cruz, and
Detectives Pablo R. <span class="SpellE">Singayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Candolesas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> de la
Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalumpines</span>,
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Manalastas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
Padua to conduct a buy-bust <span style="">operation
at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Solchuaga</span></span><span style=""> St.</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Singkamas</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Makati</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The target area was a store along the said street, and <span class="SpellE">Singayan</span> was to pose as the buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stood alone near the store waiting for any
pusher to approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other <span style="">members of the team strategically positioned
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, three men approached <span class="SpellE">Singayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of
them was the accused-appellant, who said without preamble:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Pare, gusto mo bang <span class="SpellE">umiskor</span>?"
<span class="SpellE">Singayan</span> said yes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The exchange was made then and there - two rolls/pieces of marijuana for
o</span>ne P10.00 and two P5.00 bills marked ANU (meaning Anti-Narcotics Unit).</p>

<p class="BODY">The team then moved in and arrested <span class="SpellE">Tandoy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Manalastas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Candolesas</span> made a body search of the accused-appellant and
took from him the marked money, <span style="">as </span><span style="">well as </span><span style="">eight more rolls/foils of marijuana and crushed
leaves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The arresting officers brought <span class="SpellE">Tandoy</span>
to the Office of the Anti-Narcotics Unit, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Police Station, for investigation by Detective Marvin <span class="SpellE">Pajilan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant chose to remain silent
after having been informed <span style="">of his
constitutional rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These events were narrated under oath by De la Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Singayan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pajilan</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Microscopic, chemical and <span class="SpellE">chromotographic</span> examination
was performed on the confiscated marijuana by Raquel P. Angeles, forensic
chemist of the National Bureau of Investigation, who later testified that the
findings were positive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marijuana
was offered as an exhibit.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As might be expected, the accused-appellant had a different
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony was that from <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00
 p.m.</st1:time> of the day in question, he was playing "<span class="SpellE">cara</span> y <span class="SpellE"><span style="">cruz</span></span><span style="">" with 15
other persons along </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Solchuaga</span></span><span style=""> St.</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style=""> when somebody suddenly said that policemen
were making arrests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The players grabbed
the bet money and scampered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he
and a certain Danny (another "<span class="SpellE">cara</span> y <span class="SpellE">cruz</span>" player) were caught and taken to the Narcotics
Command headquarters in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Makati</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There they were mauled and warned that </span><span style="">if </span><span style="">they did not point to their fellow pushers, they would rot in jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant denied he had sold
marijuana to <span class="SpellE">Singayan</span> and insisted the bills taken from
him were the bet money </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">had
grabbed at the "<span class="SpellE">cara</span> y <span class="SpellE">cruz</span>"
game.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, which had the opportunity to observe the
demeanor of the witnesses and to listen to their respective testimonies, gave
more credence to the statements of the arresting officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the presumption that they had
performed their duties in a regular manner, it rejected <span class="SpellE">Tandoy's</span>
uncorroborated allegation that he had been manhandled and framed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tandoy</span> had not
submitted sufficient evidence of his charges, let alone his admission that he
had no quarrel with the peace officers whom he had met only <span style="">on </span>the day of his arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People v. <span class="SpellE">Patog</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>When there is no evidence and nothing to indicate the principal
witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motives, the presumption
is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full faith and
credit.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tandoy</span> submits that "one will not
sell this prohibited drug to another who is a total stranger until the seller
is certain of the identity of the buyer."</p>

<p class="BODY">The conjecture must be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People v. <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court observed:</p>

<blockquote>Drug-pushing when done on a small level as in this case belongs to
that class of crimes that may be committed at anytime and at any place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the offer to buy is accepted and the
exchange is made, the illegal transaction is completed in a few minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the parties are in a public
place and in the presence of other people may not always discourage them from
pursuing their illegal trade as these factors may even serve to camouflage the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence the Court has sustained the
conviction of drug pushers caught selling illegal drugs in a billiard hall
(People v. Rubio, G.R. No. 66875, June 19, 1986, 142 SCRA 329; People v. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, G.R. No. 72141, January 12, 1987, 147 SCRA 252),
in front of a store (People v. Khan, <u>supra</u>) along a street at 1:45 p.m.
(People v. Toledo, G.R. No. 67609, November 22, 1985, 140 SCRA 259), and in
front of a house (People v. <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, G.R. No.
69844, February 23, 1988).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As the Court <span style="">has </span>also
held, "What matters is not an existing familiarity between the buyer and
the seller but their agreement and the acts constituting the sale and delivery
of the marijuana leaves."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the second assigned error, the accused-appellant invokes
the best evidence rule and questions the admission by the trial court of the <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> <span style="">copy </span>only
of the <span style="">marked P1</span>0.00<span style=""> </span>bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his Comment, correctly refuted that
contention thus:</p>

<blockquote>This assigned error centers on the trial court's admission of the
P10.00 bill marked money (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E-2-A) which,
according to the appellant, is excluded under the best evidence rule for being
a mere <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, appellant erroneously thinks that said marked money is an
ordinary document falling under Sec. 2, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court
which excludes the introduction of secondary evidence except in the five (5)
instances mentioned therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The best evidence rule applies only when the contents of the
document are the subject of inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where the issue is only as to whether or not such document was actually
executed, or exists, or in the circumstances relevant to or surrounding its
execution, the best evidence rule does not apply and testimonial evidence is
admissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Cf. Moran, <u>op</u>. <u>cit</u>.,
pp. 76-77; 4 Martin, <u>op</u>. <u>cit</u>., p. 78.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since the aforesaid marked money was presented by the prosecution
solely for the purpose of establishing its existence and not its contents, other
<span class="SpellE">substitutionary</span> evidence, like a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copy thereof, is therefore admissible without the need of accounting for the
original.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the presentation at the trial of the "buy-bust
money" was not indispensable to the conviction of the accused-appellant
because the sale of the marijuana had been adequately proved by the testimony
of the police officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So long as the
marijuana actually sold by the accused-appellant had been submitted as an
exhibit, the <span style="">failure to produce the
marked money itself would not constitute a fatal omission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced from the evidence on record that the prosecution
has overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence in favor of the
accused-appellant with proof beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must therefore <span style="">suffer the penalty prescribed by law for those who would visit the
scourge of drug addiction upon our people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b><span style="">,</span> the appeal is DISMISSED and the
challenged decision AFFIRMED <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>,
with costs against <span style="">the
accused-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
