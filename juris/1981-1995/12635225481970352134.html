				<H3>JULIA DAYRIT HIDALGO AND AUGUSTO HIDALGO, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND MARCELO MASANGKAY, RESPONDENTS. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
This is an agrarian case.  Marcelo Masangkay was a tenant on the coconut
 land of the petitioners with an area of 51 hectares located in Barrio 
Hulo, Cawit, Boac, Marinduque.  Because of his age, the petitioners 
ejected him in January, 1969.  He had planted 1,200 coconut trees on the
 land.  It was agreed that he was to be paid two pesos for every coconut
 tree planted by him.  He was paid P150 a month as his share in the 
proceeds of the harvest.
<p>
The Court of Appeals in a decision dated November 21, 1979, as clarified
 in its resolution of January 9, 1980, ordered (1) his reinstatement or 
the payment of P2,400 as his compensation for the coconut trees, (2) 
payment to him of P1,800 a year from January, 1969 until reinstated or 
until the sum of P2,400 is paid to him, and (3) the payÂ­ment of P600 as 
litigation expenses.
</p><p>
The petitioners appealed to this Court.  They contend that the Appellate
 Court erred (1) in concluding that Masangkay was a tenant, (2) in 
awarding grossly excessive damages not supported by substantial evidence
 and (3) in the alternative, in not declaring that the tenancy was 
terminated due to Masangkay's abandonment and incapacity.
</p><p>
These contentions cannot be entertained because they assail the factual 
conclusions of the Appellate Court which are binding and conclusive on 
this Court.  The Agrarian Court made the same findings.  Only legal 
questions may be raised in this Court (Sec. 18, Presidential Decree No. 
946, Law Reorganizing the CAR).  The instant petition should not have 
been given due course.
</p><p>
However, Masangkay, who was 96 in 1980 (p. 59, <em>Rollo</em>), should not be reinstated.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court ordering the 
petitioners to pay Masangkay P3,000 as the value of the coconut trees 
and litigation expenses, and P1,800 <em>per annum</em> from 1969 to the date the said sum of P3,000 is paid.  Costs against the petitioners.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero</em>, and<em> Abad Santos, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Escolin </em>and<em> Cuevas, JJ.,</em> did not take part.
