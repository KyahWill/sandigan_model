ninety (90) per cent of its shares of stock is owned by EBE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>EBE also obligated himself to cede, transfer

of stocks" in Embassy Farms Inc. to AGA or his nominees "until </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, AGA obligated himself, upon signing of the

<span class="SpellE">Mesina</span> had 50 shares, each registered in their
names.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said shares of 3,125 correspond

the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. No. 12817.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1987</st1:date>,
the Fifth Division of the Court of Appeals issued a consolidated resolution in
CA-G.R. Nos. 12817 and 12834 sustaining the order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1987</st1:date> of the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it set aside and lifted the

 1987</st1:date> it issued in CA-G.R. SP No. 12834.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court based its resolution on
its findings in the hearing that the Board of Directors of Embassy Farms are
nominees of AGA so that it considered AGA and Embassy Farms as one and the same
person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It noted that EBE has not
delivered the certificate of stock outstanding in his name in the books of the
corporation to AGA because the latter allegedly has not complied with the terms
and conditions of the memorandum of agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also the appellate court opined that "(I)n the instant case, it
will appear that no transfer of shares of stock has been made by Evangelista to
Asuncion as there had been no delivery of the certificate in order to produce
or effect the transfer of such shares of stock." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

 5, 1987</st1:date> of the appellate court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The primary issue for resolution is whether or not the appellate
court committed a reversible error when it sustained the order dated July 13,
1987 of the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Court and lifted the restraining
order it had issued in CA-G.R. SP No. 12834.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of Petitioner that the appellate court acted
without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction and/or gravely abused its
discretion when it sustained the order dated July 30, 1987 of the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Court and lifted the restraining order it had issued

injunction in Civil Case No. 53335 because the ouster of EBE and his
reinstatement as President and Chief Executive Officer of Embassy Farms is an
intra-corporate matter within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

National Capital Judicial Region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner likewise claimed that the writ of preliminary injunction
issued in Civil Case No. 53335 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">irregularly issued because it

the source of their supposed shares of stock in the corporation is not asking
for the delivery of the indorsed certificate of stock but for the rescission of
the memorandum of agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rescission
would result in mutual restitution (Magdalena Estate v. Myrick, 71 Phil. 344)
so it is but proper to allow EBE to manage the farm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Compared to AGA or his nominees EBE would be
more interested in the preservation of the assets, equipment and facilities of
Embassy Farms during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the main case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to petitioner's contention the dispute at bar is not an <span class="SpellE">intracorporate</span> controversy within the exclusive and
original jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission under
Presidential Decree No. 902-A as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1758.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To be an <span class="SpellE">intracorporate</span>
controversy it must pertain to any of the following relationships:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) between the corporation, partnership or
association and the public; (2) between the corporation, partnership or
association and the state in so far as its franchise, permit or license to
operate is concerned; (3) between the corporation, partnership or association
and its stockholders, partners, members or officers; and (4) among the
stockholders, partners or associates themselves (Union Glass and Container
Corp. v. SEC 126 SCRA 31; DMRC Enterprises v. <span class="SpellE">Este</span>
Del Sol Mountain Reserve Inc. 132 SCRA 293; Rivera v. Florendo,144 SCRA 643; <span class="SpellE">Abeijo</span> v. De la Cruz. 149 SCRA 654).</p>

<p class="BODY">Basically the conflict here is between AGA and EBE arising from a
contract denominated as a memorandum of agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here the controversy in reality involves the
contractual rights and obligations of AGA and EBE under the memorandum of
agreement and not to the enforcement of rights and obligations under the
corporation code or the internal or <span class="SpellE">intracorporate</span>
affairs of the corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AGA or his
nominees are not even the lawful stockholders of Embassy Farms because EBE for
a justifiable reason has withheld the delivery of the indorsed certificate of
stocks so that the suppose transfer by virtue of the memorandum of agreement
could not be properly recorded in the book of the corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dispute therefore does not fall within
the special jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission but with
regular Courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AGA or his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nominees </span>unduly dragged the petitioner
Embassy Farms in order to resist the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">order
</span>of the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>
and to confuse the real and legitimate issue in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the enforceability of the order of the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>, We see no cogent
reason to depart from the ruling of the trial court which was sustained by the
Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Generally, an
injunction under Section 21 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilang</span> 129 is enforceable within the region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that the trial court has no
jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin acts being
performed or about to be performed outside its territorial boundaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(C.F. Tan vs. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,
L-24971, June 20, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, to
avoid an irreparable prejudice We allowed in <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
Electric Corporation et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Pano</span> (95 SCRA 693) the
enforcement of an injunction to restrain acts committed outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the issuing Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> case We ruled that a Court of First Instance has
jurisdiction to try a case although the acts sought be restrained are committed
outside its territorial jurisdiction where the principal business addresses of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">parties and the decisions on the
acts to be restrained are located and originated within the Court's
jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Here to avoid an injustice and irreparable injury We apply the
exception rather than the general rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both parties are residents of the National Capital Region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AGA is a resident of <st1:address><st1:street>7-A
  Lake Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>San Juan</st1:city></st1:address>, Metro
Manila while EBE is residing at <st1:street><st1:address><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">113 R. Tirana Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, BF Homes, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Paranaque</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AGA filed the case with the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Pasig</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> and the injunction as an equitable remedy
intended to preserve the status quo is directed against AGA, his nominees and
agents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, as noted by the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Court all orders to be enforced and executed at
Embassy Farms in Loma de <span class="SpellE">Gato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> emanated from its main office which is
located at the 2nd Floor, Agora Complex, Domingo Street, San Juan, Metro
Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on the issue whether or not the writ of injunction was
irregularly issued as it was issued on July 30, 1987 one day ahead of the
injunction bond, suffice it to say that aside from the factual findings of the
Court of Appeals that the date July <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">31,
1987, appearing on the bond is a typographical error it must be pointed out
that with the injunction bond the party enjoined is amply protected against </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">loss </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">or damage in case it is finally decided that the injunction ought not </span>to
