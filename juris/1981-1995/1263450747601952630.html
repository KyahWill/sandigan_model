				<H3>THE HEIRS OF PEDRO MEDINA, REPRESENTED BY MARGARITA MEDINA, PETITIONERS,
VS. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS,* RESTITUTA
ZURBITO VDA. DE MEDINA AND ANDRES NAVARRO, JR., RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>TEEHANKEE, Acting C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court upholds the decision of the Court of Appeals which
dismissed petitioners' complaint to recover from private respondents a parcel
of land situated in Oac, Milagros, Masbate, together with the Spanish title
(Titulo Real No. 349581) covering it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals correctly found that petitioners failed to prove
their claim that respondents were holding the property on the basis of an
express trust, the existence of which, according to law and to established
jurisprudence, cannot be proven by mere carol evidence and cannot rest on vague
and uncertain evidence or on loose, equivocal or indefinite declarations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, assuming that there existed a
constructive trust in petitioners' favor, petitioners' action to recover the
property had been lost by both extinctive and ac­quisitive prescription by
virtue of respondents' continuous, uninter­rupted and unchallenged possession
and occupancy of the premises ad­versely and in the concept of owner-buyer for
thirty-three years, counted from the execution in 1924 of the deed of sale in
respondents' favor to the filing of the action in 1957.</p>

<p class="BODY">The late Francisco Medina had eight children, namely, Gre­gorio, <u>Sotero</u>,
<u>Narciso</u>, Victorina, Simona, Carmen, <u>Pedro</u> and Hos­picia, all of
whom are deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Margarita
Medina, who filed the complaint on behalf of the heirs of Pedro Medina in the
Court of First Instance of Masbate, is the daughter of Pedro Medina<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
who predeceased his father Francisco Medina.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Restituta Zurbito Vda. de Medina, herein private respondent, and
defendant in the trial court, is the widow of Sotero Medina (brother of Pedro
Medina); and Andres Navarro, Jr., her herein co-respondent and co-defendant in
the trial court, is her grandson.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 6, 1957, herein petitioners filed the complaint in the
trial court seeking to recover from herein respondents a parcel of land
situated in the sitio of Oac, municipality of Milagros, province of Masbate,
containing an area of 321.1156 hectares and praying that respondents be ordered
to deliver to them possession and ownership thereof with accounting, damages
and costs and litigation expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among others, the complaint alleged that petitioner Margarita
Medina as plaintiff inherited with her sister Ana Medina the said par­cel of
land from their father Pedro Medina; that upon their father's death, she and
her sister Ana Medina being then minors were placed under the care and custody
of the spouses Sotero Medina and Restituta Zurbito, as guardians of their
persons and property; that the land in dispute was placed under the management
of Sotero Medina as adminis­trator thereof, and upon Sotero's death, under the
management of his widow, Restituta Zurbito; that she later discovered that the
land in question was surreptitiously declared for taxation purposes in the name
of Andres Navarro, Jr., grandson of Restituta Zurbito; that said respondents as
defendants had without color of title denied pe­titioners' ownership and
instead had claimed ownership thereof since the year 1948 and exercised acts of
possession and ownership thereon to the exclusion of petitioners; that
petitioners had demanded that <span style="">res­</span>pondents
vacate the premises and deliver possession and ownership thereof, but the
latter failed and refused to do so; that respondent Andres Navarro, Jr. had
excavated soil from the land in question and sold the same to the Provincial
Government of Masbate without the knowledge and consent of petitioners and
appropriated the pro­ceeds thereof to his personal benefit to the damage and
prejudice of the plaintiff; and that respondent Restituta Zurbito Vda. de
Medina never rendered an accounting of the income of the property in ques­tion
in spite of their repeated demands and instead appropriated all the income
therefrom to her personal use and benefit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents as defendants alleged on the other hand that
petitioner Margarita and her deceased sister Ana were but illegitimate children
of Pedro Medina and for that reason did not enjoy the status of recognized
natural children, such that when Pedro died intestate, Francisco Medina,
Pedro's father who was still living, succeeded to his properties; that upon the
death of Francisco, his children succeed­ed to his properties and the land in
dispute was adjudicated to Gregorio, Sotero, and Narciso Medina; that in a deed
of extrajudicial partition the land was later adjudicated solely to Narciso
Medina; that Narciso Medina having become sole and exclusive owner of the land
in question by virtue of said partition sold the same to Restituta and her
husband Sotero Medina on June 29, 1924, as evidenced by a deed of sale; that
from that day, respondents had actually possessed the land in question in the
concept of owners, publicly, openly and continuously and adverse­ly against the
whole world so that whatever right, interest, title or participation
petitioners had or might have had in the property had been lost by extinctive
prescription and by virtue of the <span style="">33 </span>years of exclusive actual possession in
the concept of owner of the spouses Sotero and Restituta Medina who had thereby
acquired title thereto by acquisitive prescription, even granting <u><span style="">arguendo</span></u><span style=""> </span>that petitioners had some title, right or interest over the
land.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, judgment was rendered declaring petitioner Mar­garita
Medina with her coheirs as the lawful owners of the land in ques­tion; ordering
respondents to deliver unto them the "titulo real No. 349581" and to
restore to them the actual possession thereof; and or­dering respondents to pay
them certain amounts representing the pro­duce of the land and attorneys' fees
and costs of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon appeal, respondent Court of Appeals reversed the trial
court's decision and sustaining respondents' defenses of prescription of action
and acquisitive prescription, ordered the dismissal of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners twice moved in vain to reconsider the appellate
court's adverse decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
petition for review, which we find to be without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it should be mentioned that the avowed status of
petitioner Margarita Medina and her deceased sister Ana Medina as
"legitimate daughters" of Pedro Medina, which assertion had been
vigorously objected to both in the trial and appellate courts by respon­dents
(who challenged the trial court's admission of petitioners' amended reply
asserting their status as "legitimate children," chang­ing and
amending the statement in their original reply that they were
"acknowledged natural daughters" of their father Pedro Medina and
recognized by their "deceased natural grandparents"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>),
was deter­mined positively in favor of petitioners by the Court of Appeals
which ruled that there was sufficient evidence upholding the trial court's find­ing
on their legitimate filiation based on the testimonies of witnesses who
testified on the fact of the marriage of their parents Pedro Medina and Rosario
Ramirez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said findings of fact may no
longer be disturbed in these proceedings, and at any rate do not affect the
disposition of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decisive issue at bar, bearing in mind the legitimate
filiation of petitioners, and thus the would-be validity of their claim to the
land, is simply whether or not petitioners' action for recovery thereof has
been barred by prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of respondents' defense of prescription in turn
rests upon whether or not an <u>express trust</u> over the property in litiga­tion
has been constituted by petitioners' father Pedro Medina (who predeceased his
father Francisco Medina) upon his brother Sotero and So­tero's wife Restituta
Zurbito for the benefit of his children, petitioner Margarita Medina and her
deceased sister Ana Medina and the latter's heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As provided by our Civil Code, "Trusts are either express or
implied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Express trusts are created by
the intention of the trustor or of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Implied trusts come into being by operation of law." (Art. 1441)
"No express trusts concerning an immovable or any in­terest therein may be
proven by parol evidence." (Art. 1443) "An im­plied trust may be
proven by oral evidence." (Art. 1457)<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applied to the case at bar, if an <u>express</u> trust had been con­stituted
upon the occupancy of the property by respondents in favor of the petitioners,
prescription of action would not lie, the basis of the rule being that the
possession of the trustee is not adverse to the bene­ficiary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But if there were merely a constructive or
implied trust, the action to recover may be barred by prescription of action or
by acqu<span style="">i</span>sitive prescription by
virtue of respondents' continuous and ad­verse possession of the property in
the concept of owner-buyer for thirty-three years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court correctly held that the facts and evi­dence
of record do not support petitioners' claim of the creation of an express trust
and imprescriptibility of their claim, ruling squarely that "the facts do
not warrant the conclusion that an ex­press trust was created over the land in
dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although no par­ticular words
are required for the creation of an express trust, a clear intention to create
a trust must be shown (Article 1444, Civil Code of the Philippines); and the
proof of fiduciary relationship must be clear and convincing (Quiogue vs.
Arambulo, 45 O.G. 305; Es­pinosa vs. Tumulak, CA-G.R. No. 30075-R, June 26,
1964).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ex­press trusts are those
intentionally created by the direct and posi­tive act of the trustor, by some
writing, deed or will, or oral de­claration (54 Am. Jur. 33-34).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The creation of an express trust must be
manifested with reasonable certainty and cannot be inferred from loose and
vague declarations or from ambiguous circumstances susceptible of other
interpretations (54 Am. Jur. 48-49).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in the record is there any evidence, and the plaintiffs do not
even raise the pretention, that the original owner of the property Pedro
Medina, father of plaintiff Margarita Medina, appointed, designated or
constituted Sotero Medina (the husband of defendant Restituta Zur­bito Medina)
as the trustee of the land in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiffs' con­tention that there was an express trust must, therefore,
fail."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Concretely, petitioners anchor their claim of an express trust on
the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
respondents' possession of the <u>titulo real</u> covering the land; (2) the
deed of partition of the estate of the common predecessor Francisco Medina
dated Feb­ruary 3, 1924, adjudicating the land solely to his son Narciso Me­dina;
(3) the deed of sale of the land dated June 29, 1924, executed by Narciso
Medina in favor of his brother Sotero Medina; and (4) the testimony of
respondent Restituta Zurbito Vda. de Medina (Sotero's wife) to the effect that
her husband used to "administer" and then later on, she herself
"administered" the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">These circumstances do not make out the creation of an express
trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents' possession of the
Spanish title issued in the late Pedro Medina's name may just be the
consequence of the sale of the land by Narciso (to whom it had been adjudicated
in the partition) to the spouses Sotero Medina and Restituta Zurbito on June
29, 1924 and is by no means an evidence of an express trust created for the
benefit of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Spanish titles
are defeasible, and "although evidences of ownership . . . . may be lost
through prescription."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither is the deed of partition (which apparently excluded Pedro Medina)
entered into earlier any indication of an express creation of a trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, these documents are adverse to
petitioners' cause, and are evidences of transfer of ownership of the land from
one owner/owners to another or others and they in fact negate the creation or
existence of an express trust.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither does the testimony of Sotero's widow, Restituta Zurbito,
to the effect that her husband and then later she herself "ad­ministered"
the land support petitioners' claim of an express trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the term
"administration" as used by said respondent in her testimony is by
reason of an appointment as such on behalf of another owner or beneficiary,
such as to support the existence of an express trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it appears clear from the
context of her testimony that her use of the term "administer" was in
the concept of an owner-buyer "administering" and managing his/her
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioners cite her following testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
what manner did you possess this property from the time you bought it from
Narciso Medina? - A. First my husband was the one who administered the property
and then later on, I ad­ministered there." (T.s.n., Dec. 4, 1963, p. 119.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But continuing her testimony, she clearly declared, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
did you hold the property?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In what
manner?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
I bought it, I was the one pos­sessing it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the date of this document which is June 1924, (Exhibit 2) has there been
anybody who disturbed you in your pos­session of your property?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
sir, we were not disturbed there."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court thus likewise correctly held, absent the existence
of an express trust, that "The legal construction most favor­able to
(petitioners) that can be impressed upon the facts of the case is that a
constructive or implied trust was created by operation of law upon the property
in question,"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
but petitioners' cause of action had prescribed upon the lapse of the ten-year
period of acquisitive pres­cription provided by the then applicable statute
(section 41 of Act 190)<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
for unregistered lands such as the land herein involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the Court of Appeals., the land was sold to Sotero
Medina on June 29, 1924 from which date Sotero and his wife took open, public,
continuous and adverse possession of the land in the concept of owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1957 when the present action was filed,
thirty-three (33) years, much more than the 10-year statu­tory period for
acquisitive prescription, had already elapsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the appellate court further held that petitioners'
action to recover was likewise time-barred, pointing out that "the
ten-year period under the statute of limitation within which plaintiffs could
file an action for recovery of real property commenced to run in 1933 when
plaintiff Margarita Medina was informed that the land in dispute belonged to
her father Pedro Medina, for in that year she could have brought an action for
reconveyance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of prescription
commences to run from the day the action may be brought (Article 1150, Civil
Code of the Philippines), and in an action based on fraud, as is the basis of
the present action, the period of pres­cription begins from the discovery of
the fraud (IV Tolentino's Civil Code of the Philippines 40, citing Anuran vs.
Aquino, 38 Phil. 29 and Solatorio vs. Solatorio, 52 Phil. 444); the reasons a
party might have had for not immediately taking judicial action is immaterial
and does not stop the running of the period (Lamko vs. Dioso, No. L-6923,
October 31, 1955)."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent court had referred to such non-action as "perhaps in deference
to the defendants who had raised and clothed her."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The similar case of <u>Cuaycong vs. Cuaycong</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Court, after finding the non-existence of an express trust applying
Article 1443 of the Civil Code which bars parol evidence in proving the alleged
creation of an express trust over immovables, held that "even assuming the
alleged trust to be an implied one, the right al­leged by plaintiffs would have
already prescribed since starting in 1936 when the trustor died, plaintiffs had
already been allegedly refused by the aforesaid defendants in their demands
over the land, and the compliance filed only in 1961 - more than the 10-year
period of prescription for the enforcement of such rights under the trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that the right to enforce an
implied trust in one's favor prescribes in ten (10) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even under the Code of Civil Proce­dure,
action to recover real property such as lands prescribes in ten years (Sec. 40,
Act 190)," fully supports the correctness of the decision under review.</p>

The subject of express and implied trusts is extensively treated in Ramos <i>vs</i>.
Ramos, 61 SCRA 284 (1974).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, as
here, plaintiffs failed to prove any ex­press trust and their action based on
implied trust was held to be barred by prescription:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There is a rule that a trustee cannot
acquire by prescription the ownership of property entrusted to him (Palma <i>vs</i>.
Cristobal, 77 Phil. 712), or that an action to compel a trustee to convey
property registered in his name in trust for the benefit of the <u>cestui qui
trust</u> does not prescribe (Manalang <i>vs</i>. Canlas, 94 Phil. 776;
Cristobal <i>vs</i>. Gomez, 50 Phil. 810), or that the defense of prescription
can­not be set up in an action to recover property held by a person in trust
for the benefit of another (Sevilla <i>vs</i>. De los Angeles, 97 Phil. 875),
or that property held in trust can be recovered by the beneficiary re­gardless
of the lapse of time (Marabilles <i>vs</i>. Quito, 100 Phil. 64; Bancairen <i>vs</i>.
Diones, 98 Phil. 122, 126; Juan <i>vs</i>. Zuniga, 62 O.G. 1351, 4 SCRA 1221;
Jacinto <i>vs</i>. Jacinto, L-17957, May 31, 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See Tamayo <i>vs</i>. Callejo, 147 Phil. 31,
37).</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"That rule applies squarely to
express trusts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis of the rule is
that the possession of a trustee is not adverse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not being adverse, he does not acquire by
prescription the property held in trust.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, section 38 of Act 190 provides that the law of prescription does
not apply 'in the case of a continuing and subsisting trust.'</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 27pt;">"With respect to
constructive trusts, the rule is different.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prescriptibility of an ac­tion for reconveyance based on
constructive trust is now settled (Alzona <i>vs</i>. Capunitan, L-10228, Feb.
28, 1962, 4 SCRA 450; Gerona <i>vs</i>. De Guzman, <i>supra</i>; Claridad <i>vs</i>.
Henares, 97 Phil. 973; Gonzales <i>vs</i>. Jimenez, L-19073, Jan. 30, 1965, 13

Magdangal, L-15539, January 30, 1962, 4 SCRA 84).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prescription may supervene in an implied
trust (Bueno <i>vs</i>. Reyes, L-22587, April 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 1179; Fabian <i>vs</i>.
