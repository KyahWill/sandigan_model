<span class="SpellE">Blancaflor</span> and Rodolfo Santos, residents of <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City, charged respondent <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>

Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. 3019), specifically Section 8 thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said Joint Sworn Letter-Complaint, they
alleged <span style="">that </span>during his
incumbency as <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City Mayor in 1981, 1982 and
1983, respondent <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span> acquired wealth in the
amounts of P2,142,637.50, P11,463,734.40 and P3,658,351.00, respectively, or a
total of <u><span style="">P17,264,722.90</span></u><span style="">, </span>which he deposited in his personal
account, CA-4670-00136-3, in the Republic Planters Bank, <span class="SpellE">Sangandaan</span>
Branch, <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of their allegations, they attached
the original copies of the bank deposits and receipts which indicated the
various sums deposited within the three-year period and which had been machine
validated from January 5, 1981 thru December 20, 1983 (Annexes 'A-1' to
'A-370', Petition).</blockquote>

Liabilities for the period ending December 31, 1982 (Annex 'B', Petition) and
December 31, 1984 (Annex 'C', Petition), said respondent had <span style="">a </span>total income of only P234,128.68
and P255,324.02, respectively; and as against his total assets (real <span style="">and personal properties) of P2,859,327.94 as
of December 31, 1982, he had loans payable in the amount of P2,425,575.60, and
against total assets of P5,143,260.98 as of December 31, 1984, he had loans
payable in the amount of P2,660,094.74.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

of respondent <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span> for the years 1981, 1982, 1983

totality of his bank deposits in the total amount of P14,184,337.16 for the
same four-year period, the Ombudsman, therefore, finds that a violation of
Republic Act 1379 and/or Section 8 of Republic Act 3019 has been committed and
that <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span> is 'probably guilty thereof' (Annex 'D',
Petition).</blockquote>

the Solicitor General averred that:</p>

argument that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> has no jurisdiction
over this forfeiture case grounded on Sec. 2 of R.A. 1379; respondent is
therefore <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from assailing the validity of
R.A. 1379;</blockquote>

frivolous, hence <span class="SpellE">outrightly</span> dismissible.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing the petition for forfeiture and in ruling that it
is the Ombudsman who has the authority to file the same before the court, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> held that:</p>

<blockquote>"Other statutory provisions pertinent to the incident at bar
read:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘The Office of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> shall have
the <u><span style="">exclusive</span></u><span style=""> </span>authority to conduct preliminary
investigation of all cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>;
to file information <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and to direct and
control the prosecution of the said cases.' (<u>Sec. 17, PD 1630</u>.)<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="2Q">'The provisions of the Decree notwithstanding, the Office of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> shall continue to have the <u>exclusive</u>
authority to conduct preliminary investigation, file the necessary information,
and direct and control the prosecution of all cases enumerated in Section 4 of
Presidential Decree No. 1606, whether such cases be within the exclusive
original/appellate jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
or the appropriate courts in accordance with the provisions of Presidential
Decree No. 1630.' (<u>Sec. 3, PD 1861, amending PD 1606</u>.)<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"Since violations of Republic Act 1379 are cognizable
exclusively by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> pursuant to Section

theretofore vested in the Regional Trial Court of the city or province where the
public officer or employee complained of resides or holds office under Section
2 of Republic Act 1379, the other provision of said section 2 insofar as it
lodged in the City or Provincial Fiscal the power to conduct the previous
inquiry/preliminary investigation must be deemed similarly modified by PD 1630,
Section 17, and PD 1861, Section 3 <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span>, in
the sense that such authority of the City or Provincial Fiscal has been
transferred to the Office of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> (now
Ombudsman).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering, further, that <span class="SpellE">PDs</span> 1630 and 1861, Sections 17 and 3, respectively, also

<p class="BODY">In effect, the dismissal of the petition for forfeiture by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> is premised on the supposition that since
violations of Republic Act No. 1379 now fall within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, and considering further that
the exclusive authority to file the necessary <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
and to direct and control the prosecution of all cases falling under the
exclusive jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> is vested
in the Office of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> (now Ombudsman), it
follows that it is the Ombudsman, and not the Solicitor General, who has the
authority to file the petition for forfeiture.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the submission of the Solicitor General that his authority
to file the petition for forfeiture under Republic Act No. 1379 should be
retained, notwithstanding the amendments introduced by Presidential Decrees
Nos. 1630 and 1861 vesting in the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> (now
Ombudsman) the exclusive authority to conduct the preliminary investigation of
all cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
(specifically those enumerated in Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 1606, as
last amended by Presidential Decree No. 1861), to file the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and to direct and control the prosecution of
said cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several reasons are advanced by the Solicitor General for his
aforesaid postulation, viz.:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The exclusive authority vested in the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> by Section 17 of Presidential Decree No. 1630
and Section 3 of Presidential Decree No. 1861 is confined only to the filing of
the information and directing and controlling the prosecution of the cases
cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, but <span style="">does not include the authority to file a
petition for forfeiture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An information,
as defined under Section 4, Rule 110, of the Rules of Court, is different from
a petition, in that an information necessarily refers to a criminal proceeding
while a petition does not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is the intention of the legislature to
delineate forfeiture proceedings under Republic Act No. 1379 from the rest of
the violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as may be implied from a reading of
Section 9 of Republic Act No. 3019 (penalties for violations of Sections 3, 4,
5, and 6 thereof), which does not include Section 8 (forfeiture judgments) of
the same law within the punishments usually associated with criminal
proceedings, such as imprisonment and/or perpetual disqualification from public
office.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provision of Republic Act No. 1379
authorizing the Solicitor General to file the petition for forfeiture, being a
special and specific provision, should prevail over Presidential Decrees Nos.
1630 and 1861 which contain general provisions involving violations not only of
Republic Act No. 1379 but also of Republic Act No. 3019.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>find for the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the creation of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
it was the Solicitor General who was authorized to initiate forfeiture
proceedings before the then court of first instance of the city or province
where the public officer or employee resides or holds office, pursuant to
Section 2 of Republic Act No. 1379<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

acquired property, said property shall be presumed <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> to
have been unlawfully acquired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Solicitor General, upon complaint by any taxpayer to the city or provincial
fiscal who shall conduct a previous inquiry similar to preliminary
investigations in criminal cases and shall certify to the Solicitor General
that there is reasonable ground to believe that there has been committed a
violation of this Act and the respondent is probably guilty thereof, shall
file, in the name and on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines, in the
Court of First Instance of the city or province where said public officer or
employee resides or holds office, a petition for a writ commanding said officer
or employee to show cause why the property aforesaid, or any part thereof,
should not be declared property of the State:<span style="">&nbsp;

removing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the civil cases stated in Section

<p class="BODY">On the foregoing considerations, there is no issue that

<p class="BODY">With the ratification of the present Constitution, the existing <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> became known as the Office of the Special

The Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Special Prosecutor were
officially and respectively created under Republic Act No. 6770, otherwise
known as the Ombudsman Act of 1989, and Executive Order No. 244.</p>

<p class="BODY">At present, the powers of the Ombudsman, as defined by Republic
Act No. 6770 corollary to Section 13, Article XI of the 1987 Constitution,
include, <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, </span>the
authority to:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) investigate and
prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of any
public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears
to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and, in the exercise of this primary
jurisdiction, it may take over, at any stage, from any investigatory agency of
Government, the investigation of such cases;<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) investigate and initiate the proper action for the recovery of
ill-gotten and/or unexplained wealth amassed after February 25, 1986 and the
prosecution of the parties involved there.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It follows that these powers vested in the Ombudsman by the
Constitution and the law have been removed from the erstwhile <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> (now called the Special Prosecutor) and may no
longer be exercised by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
powers of the previous <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> is now limited,
under the supervision and control and upon the authority of the Ombudsman, to
the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to conduct
preliminary investigation and prosecute criminal cases within the jurisdiction
of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>; (2) to enter into plea
bargaining agreements; and (3) to perform such other duties assigned to it by
the Ombudsman.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the powers of the former <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> were explained as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Under the 1987 Constitution, the Ombudsman (as distinguished from
the incumbent <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>) is charged with the duty
to:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Investigate on its own, or on complaint by any person, any act or
omission of any public official, employee, office or agency, when such act or
omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.' (Sec. 13,
par. 1)</p>

<blockquote>"The Constitution likewise provides that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The existing <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> shall hereafter
be known <span style="">as </span>the Office of the
Special Prosecutor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It shall continue to
function and exercise its powers as now or hereafter may be provided by law,
except those conferred on the Office of the Ombudsman created under this
Constitution.' (Art. XI, Section 7)</p>

<blockquote>"Now then, inasmuch as the aforementioned duty is given to the
Ombudsman, the incumbent <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> (called Special
Prosecutor under the 1987 Constitution and who is supposed to retain powers and
duties NOT GIVEN to the Ombudsman) is clearly without authority to conduct
preliminary investigations and to direct the filing of criminal cases with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, except upon orders of the Ombudsman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right to do so was lost effective <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From that time, he has been divested of such
authority.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the present Constitution, the Special Prosecutor (Raul
Gonzalez) is a mere subordinate of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>
(Ombudsman) and can investigate and prosecute cases only upon the latter's
authority or orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Special
Prosecutor cannot initiate the prosecution of cases but can only conduct the
same if instructed to do so by the Ombudsman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even his original power to issue subpoena, which he still claims under
Section 10(d) of PD 1630, is now deemed transferred to the Ombudsman, who may,
however, retain it in the Special Prosecutor in connection with the cases he is
ordered to investigate."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing pronouncements, there is no doubt
that the power of the present Special Prosecutor to conduct preliminary
investigation and to prosecute is subject to the following limitations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) it extends only to criminal cases within
the jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>; and (b) the
same may be exercised only by authority of the Ombudsman.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is settled that forfeiture proceedings are actions <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">rem</span></u></span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
and, therefore, civil in nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, considering the limited authority of the present
Special Prosecutor, he is not allowed to file and prosecute forfeiture cases
provided for under Republic Act No. 1379 even if the same falls within the
jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the premise that the incumbent Special
Prosecutor cannot file the petition, is the Ombudsman empowered to initiate and
prosecute the same?</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the law originally creating the Office of the
Ombudsman then (to be known as the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>), and
the amendatory laws issued subsequent thereto will show that, at its inception,
the Office of the Ombudsman was already vested with the power to investigate
and prosecute civil and criminal cases before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
and even the regular courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resume, Presidential Decree No. 1487 provided:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Prosecution
of public personnel</u>, ? If the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>
has reason to believe that any public official, employee, or other person has
acted in a manner resulting in a failure of justice, he shall file and
prosecute the corresponding criminal, civil, or administrative case before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> or the proper court or body."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and Presidential Decree No. 1630, on its
part, had this more detailed provision:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Powers</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>
shall have the following powers:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If after preliminary investigation he finds
a prima facie case, he may file the necessary information or complaint with the
<span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> or any proper court or administrative
agency and prosecute the same;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(f)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He may file and prosecute civil and administrative
cases involving graft and corrupt practices and such other offenses committed
by public officers and employees, including those in government-owned or
controlled corporations, in relation to their office."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Decree No. 1630 was the existing law governing the
then <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> when Republic Act No. 6770 was
enacted providing for the functional and structural organization of the present
Office of the Ombudsman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This later law
retained in the Ombudsman the power of the former<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> to
investigate and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or
omission of any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or
omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the Ombudsman is now vested with
primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear, therefore, that, as declared
by respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, it is the Ombudsman who
should file the petition for forfeiture involved <span style="">in </span>this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, while we do not discount the authority of the
Ombudsman, we believe and so hold that the exercise of his correlative powers
to both investigate and initiate the proper action for the recovery of
ill-gotten and/or unexplained wealth is restricted only to cases for the
recovery of ill-gotten and/or unexplained wealth which were amassed after
February 25, 1986.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Prior to aid date, the Ombudsman is without authority to <u><span style="">initiate</span></u><span style=""> </span>such forfeiture proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We, however, uphold his authority to <u><span style="">investigate</span></u><span style=""> </span>cases
for the forfeiture or recovery of such ill-gotten and/or unexplained wealth
amassed even before the aforementioned date, pursuant to his general
investigatory power under Section 15(1) of Republic Act No. 6770.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the alleged unexplained wealth of respondent <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span>, Jr. was supposed
to have been acquired from 1981 to 1983.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Verily, the Ombudsman, like the Special Prosecutor, is without authority
to initiate and file the petition for forfeiture against respondent <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our considered opinion, therefore, that <span style="">in </span>cases of unlawfully acquired wealth
amassed before <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1986</st1:date>,
as is the situation obtaining in the case at bar, it is the Solicitor General
who should file the petition for forfeiture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason is manifestly supplied by an analysis of the interplay of
antecedent legislation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that when Presidential Decree No. 1486 was
issued on <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1978</st1:date>, it
vested in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> jurisdiction over
forfeiture proceedings provided for under Republic Act No. 1379.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 12 of the same decree gave the Chief
Special Prosecutor the authority to prosecute forfeiture cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This should be taken as merely an implied
repeal by Presidential Decree No. 1486 of the jurisdiction of the former courts
of first instance and the authority of the Solicitor General to file a petition
for forfeiture under Section 2 of Republic Act No. 1379 <span style="">by </span>transferring said jurisdiction and authority to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and the Chief Special Prosecutor,
respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1978</st1:date>, Presidential Decree No. 1606 was enacted expressly
repealing Presidential Decree No. 1486.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Issued on the same date was Presidential Decree No. 1607 which declared
the official creation of the Office of the Chief Special Prosecutor, with
Section 17 thereof providing for its exclusive authority to conduct preliminary
investigation of all cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
file <span class="SpellE">informations</span> <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
and direct and control the prosecution of said cases therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still and all, it now bears stressing that,
under the state of the law at that juncture, the authority of the Chief Special
Prosecutor no longer included the right to file actions for forfeiture under
Republic Act No. 1379, nor was such authority vested in any other office or
agency.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a respected rule of statutory construction that "where
a law which repeals a prior law, not expressly but by implication, is itself
repealed, x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>the repeal of
the repealing law revives the prior law, unless the language of the repealing
statute provides otherwise."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the repeal of Presidential Decree No. 1486 necessarily revived the
authority of the Solicitor General to file a petition for forfeiture under
Section <span style="">2 </span>of Republic Act No.
1379, but not the jurisdiction of the quondam courts of first instance over the
case nor the authority of the provincial or city fiscals to conduct the
preliminary investigation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, since said powers
at that time remained in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and the
Chief Special Prosecutor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That such was
the intendment of the law can be irresistibly deduced from a reading of Section
4 of Presidential Decree No. 1606 retaining in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
jurisdiction over violations of Republic Act No. 1379, and of Section 17 of
Presidential Decree No. 1607 which vested in the Chief Special Prosecutor the
right to conduct a preliminary investigation and to file only <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that the authority thereafter
restored to the then <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> to file <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> does not include the filing of a petition for
forfeiture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier mentioned, an
information is an accusation in writing charging a person with an offense and
requires a criminal proceeding; a petition for forfeiture involves a civil
action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">rem</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
Solicitor General was, therefore, acting within the scope of his authority when
he filed the petition for forfeiture before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, such authority of the Solicitor
General is not an entirely new concept if <span style="">we
</span>are to consider that under Executive Order No. 14 the Solicitor General
is empowered to assist in the filing and prosecution of cases for a violation
thereof, including forfeiture proceedings under Republic Act No. 1379 <span style="">in </span>connection with Executive Orders
Nos. 1 and 2.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> promulgated on <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1989</st1:date> is hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE, and
