<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rep. Act No. 6655,
otherwise known as the "Free Public Secondary Education Act of 1988,"
includes in its coverage state colleges and universities </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">SCUs</span>) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">offering secondary courses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents contend that since a secondary
course is being offered in UPCB, petitioners cannot unilaterally withdraw <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">therefrom</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
otherwise, the said Act would be nothing but a mere nullity for all other <span class="SpellE">SCUs</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
respondents contend, petitioners already recognized the applicability of Rep.
Act No. 6655 when they implemented the same at the UPCBHS for School Year
1988-89 and petitioners' assertion that UPCBHS was established only if it would
be "self-supporting and should not entail any subsidy from the budget of
UP" </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">but a lame excuse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it must be pointed out that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">UPCBHS was </span>established subject to a
number of <span class="SpellE">conditionalities</span>, e.g., it must be
self-supporting, it can serve as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>feeder
for the UP at <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>, it can serve as a laboratory
and demonstration school for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prospective
teachers, failing in which the University can order its abolition on academic
grounds, specially where the purposes for which it was established was not
satisfied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically, the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was created under its Charter (Act No. 1870 [1908], as amended) to provide
advanced tertiary education and not secondary education.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 2 of said Act states that "the
purpose of said University shall be to provide advanced instruction in
literature, philosophy, the sciences, and arts, and to give professional and
technical training."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent that secondary education is not the mandated
function of the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
consequently, the latter can validly phase out and/or abolish the UPCBHS
especially so when the requirements for its continuance have not been met, Rep.
Act No. 6655 to the contrary notwithstanding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The findings of facts by the Board of Regents which led to its decision
to phase out the UPCBHS must be accorded respect, if not finality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acts of an administrative agency within their
areas <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of competence must not be
casually overturned by the courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
must be emphasized that UPCBHS was established as a component of the tertiary
level, i.e., the teacher/training program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As it turned out however, the latter program was not viable </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">UPCB thereby necessitating the phasing out of UPCBHS, the rationale
being its reasons for existence no longer exists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this score, UPCBHS differs from the other
UP high schools in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
  13.0pt">Iloilo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

schools for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>
in said areas, whereas, in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
there is no <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Education</st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful perusal of Rep. Act No. 6655 could not lend respondents
a helping hand either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said Act
implements the policy of the State to provide free public secondary education
(Sec. 4) and vests the formulation of a secondary public education curriculum <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(Sec. </span>5),
the nationalization of public secondary schools <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(Sec. 7) </span>and the implementation of the
rules and regulations thereof (Sec. 9) upon the Secretary of the Department of
Education, Culture and Sports (DECS).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rep. Act No. 6655 complements Sec. 2 (2), Article XIV of the
Constitution which mandates that the State shall establish and maintain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>system of
free public secondary education.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, this mandate is not directed to institutions of higher learning
like UP but to the government through the Department of Education, Culture and
Sports (DECS).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As an institution of
higher learning enjoying academic freedom, the UP cannot be compelled to
provide for secondary education.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, should UP operate a high school in the exercise of its academic
freedom, Rep. Act No. 6655 requires that the students enrolled therein
"shall be free from payment of tuition and other school fees."</p>
