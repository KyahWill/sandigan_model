them:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x to LIFE IMPRISONMENT each and to pay jointly and

This decision then is limited to the appeal of Rodrigo Enciso.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution of this case was commenced by the filing on 25
August 1982 of a criminal complaint for "robbery with parricide and
attempted parricide" against the accused in the Municipal Trial Court of
Burauen, Leyte.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

Fiscal of Leyte which on 9 September 1983 filed an Information<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
with Branch 15 of the RTC of Leyte charging the accused with the crime of
robbery with homicide, committed in Esperanza, Burauen, Leyte on 30 July 1982.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three "John Does" have not been arrested up to the
present.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the appellants had each pleaded not guilty upon
arraignment, trial on the merits was held on various dates.  The witnesses presented by the prosecution
were Dr. Dionisio Conde, P/Cpl. Eliseo Regorosa, Fidel Martola, Romeo Lagario
and Leonides Lagario.  The witnesses
presented by the defense were Romeo Maca, Dalmacio Culas, Soledad Lagario,
Policeman Rodolfo Inghoy, Manuel Villegas, Cesario Lopez, Rodolfo Lagario,
Rodrigo Enciso, Rogelio Valle and Anecito Sayong.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution is summarized in the Brief for
the Appellee, which we hereby adopt, it being fully supported by the trial
court's findings and the transcripts of the stenographic notes of the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<blockquote>"At around six o'clock in the evening of July 30, 1982,
Leonides Lagario, Meliton Lagario and their three (3) grandsons Rodolfo, Jr.,
Romeo and Roger, all surnamed Lagario, were preparing for supper in their house
located in Barangay Esperanza, Barauen, Leyte.  Momentarily, they were perturbed by the incessant barking of their dogs.  To find out what was agitating the animals,
Romeo Lagario and his grandmother Leonides looked out through their
window.  Romeo saw six (6) men outside
three of whom he recognized, namely:  Rodolfo Lagario, the very son of Leonides, whom Romeo calls 'Tatay
Rudy,' Aniceto Sayong alias 'Sitoy', and Rodrigo Enciso alias 'Luding', herein
appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Immediately, three (3) of the six men rushed to the door of the
house and demanded that it be opened.  When the residents refused, appellant Enciso proceeded to the kitchen
door while Aniceto Sayong and an unidentified companion rammed the main
door.  Aniceto Sayong and his companion
eventually gained entry through a hole on the door.  Both malefactors were armed with bolos.  Aniceto Sayong was recognized by Leonides Lagario because the
light was on.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Once inside, Sayong attacked and hacked Meliton Lagario's right
arm, completely severing it.  He
continued to hack his victim on the forehead, and then on the left hand causing
Meliton's left thumb, ring finger and index finger to fly off.  He delivered the final blow on the victim's
chest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereafter, appellant Rodrigo Enciso, bound the hands and feet of
Leonides Lagario, dragged her alongside her dead husband's body and then hit
her with a gun.  He asked her where she
kept the money.  Both Sayong and
appellant Enciso took turns in hitting Leonides.  Finally, Leonides, pointed to the trunk as the place where the
money was kept.  After taking the money
from the trunk, both malefactors demanded more.  Leonides, however, heard the voice of her son, Rodolfo Lagario, who
from outside the house uttered these words ‘You come down, anyway my father is
dead.' Hearing this, the malefactors left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subsequently, Leonides' grandchildren untied her and helped her
walk over to the house of her daughter, Erlinda.  As a result of the beating inflicted on her, she suffered
numerous injuries including deafness in one of her ears.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and investigated the
incident."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant Rodrigo Enciso relies on his defense
of alibi.  His testimony is condensed by
the trial court in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>"The testimony of accused Rodrigo Enciso is in corroboration
with his witnesses more particularly with witness Romeo Maca that they, in
company with Rodolfo Udtuhan, Federico Juan, Jr., Antonio Crebillo and Arturo
Crebillo, were, at about six o'clock in the evening of July 30, 1982, in the
house of his brother Clemente Enciso at Barangay Malabca, Burauen, Leyte
attending the barangay fiesta therein.  That he, in company with his companions, slaughtered the pig of his
brother which was finished at about 6:30 o'clock in the evening of same
date.  They ate their supper and have
(sic) a drinking spree of tuba until about 12:00 o'clock midnight when they
decided to go back to Barangay Balorinay, Burauen, Leyte by hiking and arriving
at the latter barangay at about 1:30 o'clock in the morning of July 31,
1982."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The nine-page Brief for Appellants Anecito Sayong and Rodrigo
Enciso,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
which was filed only on 5 November 1993 by Attorneys Wilfredo S. Oledan and
Bonifacio Matol (after having obtained several extensions of time to file the
Brief and after having been fined for their unsatisfactory explanation of their
failure to timely file the Brief),<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
contains the following assignment of errors:</p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>THAT THE HONORABLE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN
GIVING CREDENCE TO THE INHERENTLY WEAK TESTIMONY OF THE PROSECUTION WITNESSES.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THAT THE HONORABLE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED
IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONY OF APPELLANTS AND THEIR WITNESSES.</blockquote>

<blockquote>III.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>THAT THE HONORABLE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN
CONVICTING APPELLANTS.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main argument in support thereof is appellant Enciso's
contention that the decision of the trial court is "a critical analysis
and centered more on the weakness of the evidence submitted by appellants and
accused rather than a discussion on, and of, the strength of the evidence of
the prosecution."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
He then proceeds to cite the fact that the trial court failed to mention, even
in passing, the testimony of prosecution witness Pat. Regorosa whose
investigation report of the incident did not mention the identities of the
assailants; and the testimony of prosecution witness Soledad Lagario, daughter
of the victim Meliton Lagario, that when she asked her mother, Leonides Lagario
and her nephew, Romeo Lagario, whether they recognized the perpetrators, they
answered that they did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Enciso admits that alibi is a weak, if not the weakest,
defense in a criminal case.  Nevertheless, he submits that the rule is settled that conviction of the
accused must be had on the basis of the strength of the prosecution's evidence
and not on the weakness of that of the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue, therefore, revolves upon the findings of fact of the
trial court which, in turn, depend largely on the credibility of
witnesses.  The trial court made the
following observations and findings:</p>

<blockquote>"The prosecution witnesses particularly the survivor of this
unfortunate incident Leonides Lagario y Baldevia and Romeo Lagario pointed to
Aniceto Sayong and Rodrigo Enciso and Rodolfo Lagario, one of the sons of Leonides
Lagario and uncle of Romeo Lagario, as the perpetrators of the crime.  To these accusing fingers of the two
prosecution witnesses, the above-named accused persons put up the defense of
alibi that accused Rodrigo Enciso and Aniceto Sayong were in Barangay Malabca,
Burauen, Leyte attending the fiesta therein at about 6:00 o'clock in the early
evening of July 30, 1982 when the incident was taking place in Barangay
Esperanza, Burauen, Leyte.  Accused
Rodrigo Enciso alleged that at the time the incident was taking place, he was
in the house of his brother Clemente Enciso helping the latter in the
preparation of the viand with his companions among whom (sic) Romeo Maca.  Moreover, he admitted that Barangay Malabca
and Barangay Esparanza all of Burauen, Leyte, have a distance of about thirteen
(13) kilometers and connected by a road and can be negotiated even by a
motorcycle or by a truck.  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x Now, did Leonides Baldevia Lagario and Romeo Lagario
positively identify Anecito Sayong and Rodrigo Enciso since it was already
about 6:30 o'clock in the evening of July 30, 1982?  The answer is yes.  On
cross-examination she testified:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
you were lying down your face touching the floor, you could see what was
happening during this duration?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was able to see them because the light (is) was still switch on.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you were told to (lay) lie down was your husband already dead?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
husband (is) was already dead.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When

trunk by Enciso?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
was already taken.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
took the two thousand pesos, you said Enciso?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rodrigo
Enciso x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
is a good friend (barkada) and compadre of my son and also Anecito Sayong.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the foregoing, it is clear that at the time the robbery was
taking place the light was still switch on which could [only] mean an electric
light because when we say switch on and off it means an electric light and not
petromax or gas lamp.  It likewise shows
that the sum of Two Thousand Pesos (P2,000.00) was taken from the trunk and its
also shows that Mrs. Leonides Lagario knew Rodrigo Enciso and Anecito Sayong
even before July 30, 1982 because they were friends and compadre of her son
accused Rodolfo Lagario.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They were likewise at the time of the incident positively
identified by the grandson of Leonides Lagario named Romeo Lagario who was only
seven (7) years old at the time and even called them by their nicknames.  On direct examination he testified:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
many of the six persons did you recognize?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
recognized three of them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will
you please name them to the court?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tatay
Rudy, Sitoy and Ludring.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Tatay Rudy is accused Rodolfo Lagario
his uncle, Sitoy is accused Anecito Sayong and Ludring is accused Rodrigo
Enciso whom he recognized when they were still in the yard of their house.  That immediately after the incident while
they were in the house of Erlinda (Linday) Lagario he also told the policemen
about the identities of the three accused.  This came out during the cross?examination upon this young
witness:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you were already in the house of Linday Lagario did you know who arrived in the
house?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know if you can still remember the names of the policemen?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
do not know.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were
the policemen able to talk to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
were investigated by the police officers?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
you told the police officers that it was Rodolfo Lagario, Anecito Sayong and
Rodrigo Enciso who allegedly robbed your grandparents?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the foregoing, it is also clear that young Romeo Lagario
immediately told the police officers of the identity of the accused
persons.  But from the prosecution's
evidence accused Rodolfo Lagario did not come up the house as it was only accused
Anecito Sayong and Rodrigo Enciso and one not recognized who came up the
house.  On direct examination this Romeo
Lagario stated:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
they have gathered these things you mentioned including the money, what did
they do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Somebody
from outside said 'is the old man already dead so we will go.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you recognize whose voice was that from the outside?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whose
voice was that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
voice of Tatay Rudy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
your Tatay Rudy said those words, what did the persons inside the house do,
these Sitoy and Ludring?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
went down.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Likewise on the direct
examination on Mrs. Leonides Lagario she stated:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
Rodrigo Enciso was able to get money in the trunk, what did he do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
pulled me again inside my room and placed some rags inside my mouth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then
what happened next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
continued on punishing me.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>And on Court's clarificatory
questionings she stated:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
he got the P2,000.00 pesos, what did he do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
placed rags inside my mouth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
placing rags inside your mouth, what else if any happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

dead.'"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that when the issue of credibility of witnesses is
involved, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the trial
court considering that the latter is in a better position to decide the
question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment
and manner of testifying during the trial, unless certain facts of value have
been plainly overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the
case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Sixty-five years ago, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"After everything is said and done, we come back, as we
invariably do in cases of this nature, to a recognition of the rule that the
Supreme Court will not interfere with the judgment of the trial court in
passing on the credibility of the opposing witnesses, unless there appears in
the record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence, which has been
overlooked or the significance of which has been misinterpreted.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The exception to the rule is not found in
the instant case.  We sustain the trial
court's finding that appellant Enciso was positively identified as one of the
malefactors.  Having been positively
identified, his defense of alibi cannot prosper.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Conspiracy among them was established beyond a doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if Enciso was not shown to have inflicted any injury upon
the victim Meliton Lagario, he is still equally liable for the victim's death
which happened on the occasion of the robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed, as correctly ruled by the trial court, is
robbery with homicide under the first paragraph of Article 294 of the Revised
Penal Code.  The penalty prescribed
therein is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The generic aggravating circumstance of dwelling,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
although not specifically alleged in the information, was duly proved without
objection on the part of the accused.  In robbery with homicide, dwelling may be properly appreciated as an
aggravating circumstance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Dwelling is not inherent in the crime of robbery with violence or intimidation
against persons because such crime can be committed without violating or
scaling the domicile of the victim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Taking into account the aggravating circumstance of dwelling, the
penalty imposable would have been death pursuant to the first paragraph of
Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code.  In view, however, of the first paragraph of Section 19, Article III of
the 1987 Constitution, which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, the
penalty which must be imposed is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.  The trial court imposed the penalty of <u>life</u>
<u>imprisonment</u>.  We have pronounced
in a number of cases that the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is not the
same as life imprisonment for the latter does not carry with accessory penalties
and does not have a definite duration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
We reiterate our earlier advice that trial courts should be careful in using
the correct designation of penalties prescribed by the Revised Penal Code or by
special laws to avoid misunderstanding as to their scope and consequences.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In conformity with the current policy of this court, the
indemnity for the death of Meliton Lagario should be increased from P30,000.00
to P50,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the accused Anecito Sayong died pending appeal and before
final judgment in the criminal case, his liability as to the personal and
pecuniary penalties (<i>i.e.</i>, fines and costs) was consequently
extinguished.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
However, his civil liability, as distinguished from his criminal liability for
fines and costs, subsists and is chargeable against his estate.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

DISMISSING for lack of merit the appeal of appellant RODRIGO ENCISO and
AFFIRMING the assailed decision of Branch 15 of the Regional Trial Court of

liable to the heirs of Meliton Lagario in the amount of P53,028.00.  The said estate is ordered to pay the heirs
of Meliton Lagario the amount which may be demanded by the latter by virtue of
this judgment; however, said estate shall have a right of action against
Rodolfo Lagario and Rodrigo Enciso for the amount of their respective shares.</p>
