follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1979</st1:date>
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening,
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nelia</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> and Alicia <span class="SpellE">Beron</span> went
to the <span class="SpellE">BLTBCo</span>. bus terminal in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to take a bus bound for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> (pp.
10-11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="7">July
 28, 1983</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, who was Alicia's
boyfriend, went with them to see Alicia off (p. 11, <u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the terminal, <span class="SpellE">Nelia</span>, Alicia and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
immediately boarded a parked bus while Ramon went to the terminal counter to
secure student fare discounts for themselves (pp. 12-13, <u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trio proceeded to the back of the bus
where <span class="SpellE">Nelia</span> and Alicia were able to seat themselves
(p. 13, <u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While inside the
bus, it appears that <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> got into an argument with
the accused who was seated <span class="SpellE">infront</span> (sic) of the
girl's (sic) seats (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Dec. 9, 1983).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
turned to the direction of the bus door to alight from the bus (p. 13, <u>Ibid</u>.,
July 28, 1983).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was followed by the
accused (<st1:state><st1:place><u>Id</u>.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Near the door of the bus, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
and the accused began to exchange fist blows (pp. 5-6, <u>Ibid</u>., <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="12">Dec. 9, 1983</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They continued to trade fist blows on the
ground (<st1:state><st1:place><u>Id</u>.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, the accused pulled out a fan knife
and stabbed <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> (pp. 8-9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
<st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1983</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
being stabbed by the accused, both Alicia and Ramon approached the duo to break
up the fight (p. 10, <u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
Alicia embraced <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>, the accused lunged at her
three times with the knife (<st1:state><st1:place><u>Id</u>.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first two blows landed near the base of
her handbag and at the bottom of her handbag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The third blow struck her right forearm (<st1:state><st1:place><u>Id</u>.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramon, on the other hand, who was also
pulling <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> away from the accused, was likewise
stabbed by the accused with the knife, hitting the former twice on the right
arm (pp. 10-11, <u>ibid</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused then ran away towards the public market (pp. 11-12, <u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramon chased the accused but gave up the
pursuit at the entrance of the market as it was already dark (p. 12, <u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> died as a
result of the stab wound inflicted by the accused on his chest which penetrated
his chest wall and caused him to suffer cardiac arrest (pp. 7-9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="8">Aug. 31,
 1983</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. U).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramon sustained 2 stab wounds on his right
forearm which incapacitated him from performing his regular work for a period
of more than 1 month (Exhibit A).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alicia
suffered a stab wound on her right arm which prevented her from doing her
customary duties for nine (9) days (Exhibit B)." (<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:85.5pt">The accused, on the other hand,
interposed the defense of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He

<span class="SpellE">Acedillo</span>, were at the cockpit in <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> at the
time of the incident; and that thereafter, on their way to <span class="SpellE">Acedillo’s</span>
house, accused purchased a Seiko watch from out of his winnings and the store
issued to him a guarantee book dated <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="1">January
 14, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, he presented
an eyewitness to the crime, <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sorizo</span>, who testified that the accused was not the victims'
assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court discredited the appellant's defense of alibi as
weak and the testimony of the defense witness as biased and without probative
value.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>this appeal, the accused
assigned the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>"The Trial Court grossly became
dishonest to itself when it did not take into consideration the defense of
ALIBI put up by the accused perfected collaborated (sic) by two credible
witnesses;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Trial Court blinded itself by not
taking against the prosecution the inconsistencies in the testimonies given by
the witnesses against the accused." (Appellant's Brief, p. 3; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 57)<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have already ruled that for alibi to serve as a basis for
acquittal, it must be established by clear and convincing evidence (People v.
Cruz, G.R. No. 68805, July 9, 1986; 142 SCRA 576).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant must not only prove that he was
elsewhere at the time the crime was committed but also that it was impossible
for him to have been at the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This appellant failed to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
distance between <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> does not render it impossible
for appellant to be present at the place and time of the incident taking into
account the modern means of transportation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further, the Seiko guarantee booklet is to Us an unconvincing piece of
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not assure Us that the
purchase was really done in <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and not in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also possible that the watch was
purchased in the morning or in the afternoon of the said date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The conflicting testimonies of appellant and
his witness regarding the circumstances attendant to the purchase of the watch,
likewise, weakens the defense of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant contends that upon his purchase of the Seiko watch, the
jewelry store just handed him a guarantee booklet but did not give him any
receipt (TSN, February 10, 1984, p. 7; Records, p. 296).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, his witness, <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> <span class="SpellE">Acedillo</span>, testified that the
store issued to appellant a receipt and a guarantee booklet (TSN, February 10,
1984, pp. 71-72; Records, pp. 360-361).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the two were indeed together in purchasing the watch, how come their
testimonies as to the circumstances of the purchase do not jibe?</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, appellant was clearly and positively identified by the
prosecution witnesses as the assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">Sorizo</span> stating that he witnessed the said stabbing
incident that resulted to the death of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, this court could not believe him when he said that

circumstances, to wit:<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. That he was

<blockquote>"If really said witness was (sic) present when the deceased

incident or immediately after the apprehension of the accused, considering that
the said incident was properly attended to for investigation by the police
authorities of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> City who were then personally

<blockquote>"To the best analysis and findings of this court, witness <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sorizo</span> was coached by
someone to testify in favor of the accused and his testimony given in court is

<blockquote>"It is a well-settled rule that if a man remains silent when
he ought to speak (like in the present case) he will be barred from speaking
later (Gabriel vs. Bans, 56 Phil. 314).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Further, the court has observed the demeanor or manner of
said witness <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sorizo</span>
while on the witness stand and while testifying, said witness usually responded
to the questions propounded by the defense counsel on direct-examination in a
manner as if the answers were already inside his mouth or just at the tip of
his tongue and, when asked if the assailant was inside the courtroom, said
witness answered that the accused was not present, although said witness did
not bother himself to look around the court premises and gave his answer while
his face was little bit downward and facing directly to the Presiding
Judge." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, (pp. 33-34)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, furthermore, assails the credibility of some
prosecution witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claims that
the prosecution witnesses’ second, rather than their first, statements before
the police were submitted to the court; that the given description of the
assailant in their first statements matched the description given by defense
witness <span class="SpellE">Sorizo</span>; that the second statements'
description of the assailant did not match appellant's physical appearance
especially as to height since he is short while the given height was 5’7";
that witness <span class="SpellE">Panganiban's</span> identification of appellant
is questionable since it was not done in a police line-up and appellant was in
front of <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> ready to be identified; that,
also, she did not see the actual stabbing of her companions, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Beron</span>; that
witnesses Alicia <span class="SpellE">Beron</span> and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulanhagui</span>, the attending physician, were not
presented in court; that the mother of the victim, Lucia <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>,
did not identify the accused; and that Miss Rosario <span class="SpellE">Panaligan</span>,
Head, Medical Records Section of the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
Regional Hospital, who was presented in lieu of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Bulanhagui</span>,

and that Lucia <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> did not identify the appellant
as the assailant is of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
important thing is that the victims themselves identified their assailant as
the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, identification of an accused need not be done in a

<p class="BODY">Contrary to appellant's assertion, all the statements executed by
the prosecution witnesses were submitted and now formed part of the records of
the case (Records of CCC-VIII-825, pp. 3-9, 11).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged inconsistency regarding the
description of the height of the assailant compared to appellant's actual
height is trivial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that
the description given by Alicia <span class="SpellE">Beron</span> was merely the
approximate height of the assailant which des not militate against her
credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">The over-all evidence presented in these cases has fully
established the culpability of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, We do not agree with the trial court
that treachery is present in CCC-VIII?823 (79).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For treachery to be present, it must be shown
that the offender employed means, methods or forms of execution which tend
directly and specifically to insure its execution, without risk to himself
arising from the defense which the offended party might make (Art. 14, par. 16,
Revised Penal Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
the testimonies of the eyewitnesses were limited to the actual stabbing of the
victims by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were no
details as to how the stabbing incident commenced and developed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The death certificate presented by the
prosecution also did not disclose the nature of the stab wound which killed the
victim so as to infer <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> how he was
killed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It merely recited the
following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"death due to cardiac
arrest, stab wound, chest, left, penetrating chest cavity" (Exhibit U,
Records of CCC-VIII-823 (79), p. 133).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There being no circumstance which would qualify the killing to murder, the
crime committed is simple homicide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither do We agree that <span class="SpellE"><u>reiteracion</u></span> or
habitually should be appreciated in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant was found by the trial court to have committed offenses
prior to and after the incident of January 14, 1979, as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"(1) prior to January, 1979, he was
arrested and accused of the crime of theft, in Criminal Case No. 172 before the
Municipal Court of Mendez, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>; (2) that on May
15, 1973, he was likewise charged for physical injuries in <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span>
City but said case was amicably settled; (3) that on January 15, 1973, he was
likewise charged in Criminal Case No. 1343 in <span class="SpellE">Lemery</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> for the crime of theft and he was convicted
of the said offense; (4) that he was likewise charged and convicted before the
City Court of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> City in Criminal Case No.
9517; (5) that he was also charged in Criminal Case No. 842-B for theft, before
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Binan</span>, Laguna, but
said case was settled amicably; (6) finally, accused was charged and convicted
for the crime of theft before the Court of First Instance of Manila in Criminal
Case No. 82-12791 per Judgment of said court on October 30, 1982"
(Decision, p. 19; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 89).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>reiteracion</u></span>
or <span class="SpellE">habituality</span>, it is essential that the offender be
previously punished, that is, he has served the sentence, for an offense in
which the law attaches, or provides for an equal or greater penalty than that
attached by law to the second offense, or for two or more offenses, in which
the law attaches a lighter penalty (People v. <span class="SpellE">Layson</span>,
et al., G.R. No. L-25177, <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="10">October 31,
 1969</st1:date>, 30 SCRA 92).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here, the
records do not disclose that the appellant has been previously punished by an
offense to which the law attaches an equal or greater penalty or for two or
more crimes to which it attaches a lighter penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering therefore, the absence of either
aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the penalty for homicide, which is <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u>, should be imposed in its medium period (Article 249, in
relation to Article 64, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the
minimum penalty is twelve (12) years of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> and the maximum penalty is seventeen (17) years of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity for death
imposed by the trial court is increased to thirty thousand (P30,000.00) pesos
in addition to the award of five thousand (P5,000.00) pesos as actual damages
and twenty five thousand (P25,000.00) pesos as moral and exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to Criminal Case No. 770, We uphold the trial court's finding
that the appellant is guilty of slight physical injuries only, it not being
shown by any clear and convincing evidence that appellant intended to kill
Alicia <span class="SpellE">Beron</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. 771, We find the appellant guilty only of
less serious physical injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
gathered from the testimony of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> that
appellant stabbed him and Alicia <span class="SpellE">Beron</span> because they
intervened in his fight against the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, when <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> was held back
momentarily by his wounds, appellant attacked the deceased again and then, ran
away (TSN, May 13, 1983, pp. 10-11; Records, pp. 64?65).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no injury to any vital part of <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Beron</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly from the foregoing, We could not see
any intention on the part of appellant to kill <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Beron</span> (see <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> v. <span class="SpellE">Maghirang</span>,
28 Phil. 655).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He merely wanted to
incapacitate these two people so he could turn his ire once more to his real
and intended victim, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Absent the
intent to kill, appellant should be liable only for less serious physical
injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He should, therefore, be
sentenced to an imprisonment of four (4) months.</p>
