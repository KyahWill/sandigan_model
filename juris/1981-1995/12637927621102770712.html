Bohol, for a drinking spree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They

rhum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo Clemen got drunk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they repaired home.</p>

</span>According to him, he saw Clemen clutching at his wounds in the body and
arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Overcome by shock, he (Dumangcas)
allegedly passed out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But before that,
he had a glimpse of the assailant grappling with Clemen, whom he subsequently
named as the herein accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While the night was dark, he allegedly recognized the accused-appellant
from a light coming <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">from </span>the
house of Olimpia Cloma nearby.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
He averred that the accused-appellant attacked Clemen with a bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he regained consciousness, Clemen was
being loaded onto <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

to Tagbilaran City for medical treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

with Dumangcas and the deceased on the evening of the tragedy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, the deceased invited them
for a drink.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They finished two bottles of
rhum at a nearby store after which they prepared to go home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>About 15 meters from the store, the deceased

Like Dumangcas, he allegedly had a look at Clemen's attacker from the light of
Olimpia Cloma's lamp about 15 meters from the scene of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the victim and the assailant
were allegedy locked in struggle.</p>

Arcay summoned Hilario Flores, a policeman who owned a pressure lamp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Flores soon arrived with his wife, who
carried the lamp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They then rushed
Clemen to the provincial hospital located at Tagbilaran City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arcay further claims that while at the hospital, Clemen pointed
to the accused-appellant as the assailant but cautioned him not to "tell
anybody ... even my parents because if I will be already well, I will liquidate
the man."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

</span>police as early <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>February
1, 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was "interviewed"
separately by two police officers but he did not identify the assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On February 6, 1978, another policeman went
to his house and again he did not implicate the accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was, however only on March 2, 1978, or
more than a month after the unfortunate incident, that he "divulged"
to the authorities the identity of Clemen's killer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He adds, however, that he "was afraid
... because I'm working and I might be, the same thing might happen to me, the
same thing that happened to the deceased."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Arcay himself told the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">same tale to the
police authorities on March 2, 1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We reverse the judgment of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have reasonable doubt on the guilt of the
accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot accept the veracity of the testimonies of Alejandro
Dumangcas and Anito Arcay, two supposed key witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are hard put to believe, in the first
place, that the deceased Clemen did not inform the authorities, not even his
relatives, as to who attacked him (assuming he knew who it was),
notwithstanding enough opportunities for him to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records will show that he had at least
two chances to do so, first, before Patrolman Flores, the responding policeman,
during and at the scene of the incident itself, and second, before his
relatives, who saw and visited him at the hospital.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It would have been the first impulse of one supposedly on the threshold of
death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">But what is even more</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unusual
is the fact that he had to confide in, of all people, Arcay, if the latter is
indeed to be believed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it might
have been that the deceased did inform Arcay of the identity of the attacker, </span>what
is strange is that he -- so Arcay avers -- informed him (Arcay) alone, when he
(the victim) could have alerted his very relatives and the police <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>well.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Neither can we accept
Arcay's allegation that Clemen, after pointing to the accused-appellant as the
murderer, </span>urged him not to inform the authorities as he planned to get
even when he recovered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact should
be underscored that Clemen was a dying man -- a fact he must have known,
judging from the extent of his injuries -- and for one near death, it is odd
that he should imagine surviving his wounds in the hope of getting even.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What we are saying is that while it is not
abnormal for Clemen to have harbored revenge, what disturbs us is Arcay's claim
that he (Clemen) took pains to instruct him (Arcay) not to inform the
authorities when the natural urge would be to have the assassin brought to the
bar of justice where he (Clemen) could have the vindication he sought.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Under the circumstances,
we seriously doubt whether Clemen in fact knew who assaulted him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that as Arcay himself
testified, Clemen, at the time of the </span>incident wished for some light.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This suggests that Clemen did not see who attacked him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On top of that, he had imbibed alcohol.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not trust his faculties for obser<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vation in such an inebriated state.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he therefore declared to Patrolman
Flores, "I do not know the assail­ant,"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is part of the <u>res</u> <u>gestae</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And between this and his alleged confession to
Arcay, we are more prone to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">All told, we do not
accept Clemen's supposed <u>ante</u> <u>mortem</u> declaration to Arcay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clemen, we reiterate, was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the point of death, and for this reason alone he could not have
divulged to Arcay the identity of the murderer and at the same time deny
knowing him before the authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What
this indicates is that he was lying to the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe that he would have been inclined
to misrepresent in so solemn a moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has indeed been said over and over, "truth sits on the lips of
dying men."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
