<p class="BODY">Upon his arraignment in both cases on January 24, 1986, appellant
pleaded not guilty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant, Imelda Batis, is the natural daughter of
appellant.  This is her version of the
incidents:</p>

<p class="BODY">She is thirteen years old and lived with her Tatay, Nanay,
brothers and sisters in Barangay Binog, Palo, Leyte.  She and her family slept together in the same room, their house
being a one-function room.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In the evening of June 15, 1985, she was awakened when somebody holding an
icepick and pointing the same at her, got near her.  She recognized the person as her father.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
She was told not to make any noise lest she be killed.  Her mother was only about two and a half
meters away.  Then her father took off
her dress and when he put down the icepick, that was the time she shouted for
help, calling "Nanay! Nanay!".  Her mother was awakened but according to her, she just stared and looked
while her father was in the act of sexually abusing her, adding the comment
"Good for you".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
She kept on crying the following morning but again because of fear of her
father, she was forced to go with him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in
</span>gathering tuba, waiting for him for an hour while her father was atop the
coconut tree.  She considered it useless
to complain to her mother considering her reaction the night before, added to
her remark that "You and your father should live together as husband and
wife".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The second time she was raped was in the evening of June 28, 1985
while she was again asleep, this time alone, since her mother was washing
clothes in another house and her brothers and sisters were somewhere else.  Her father started kissing her but she
resisted, tried to push him away, and kept on calling "Nanay!
Nanay!".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
She was slapped by her father, took off her dress and then placed himself on
top of her.  She was again warned not to
tell anybody what happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 29, 1985, while her father just arrived from gathering
tuba and she was playing jackstones, her Kuya Miguel and his mother arrived in
their house.  She informed them of their
receipt of a letter from her mother which did not carry any return address.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At first her father refused to let her go with her Kuya Miguel so
she could get her mother's address but relented when told that she would be
bringing home some rice and fish for the family.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
On this pretext, Miguel brought complainant along with him and while on their
way, Miguel confronted her about the news that she was raped by her own father.  At first, she was hesitant to confide but
then she confirmed it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
She was brought to Miguel's house in Cavite, West Palo, Leyte and not long
after they arrived there, her father came.  She was not allowed by Miguel to go with her father and before the
latter could come back with a policeman, she and Miguel rushed to the Municipal
Hall to report the incident.  From the
Municipal Hall, she was transferred to the hospital where she was examined.  Since then on, she never returned to their
house but instead lived with Arturo Margallo, an uncle.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross examination, complainant stated that she worked as a
cook for one and a half months starting from May 6, 1985 for the Barangay
Captain of Rizal, Dagami, Leyte;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
that her mother left for Manila on June 15, 1985;<a style="mso-footnote-id:

her father likewise lived in the house of the Barangay Captain in Rizal,
Dagami, Leyte; that she returned to Barangay Binog, Palo, Leyte on June 20,
1985 when she was fetched by her mother;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
that she went with Miguel Margallo (her Kuya Miguel) to the latter's house in
the morning of June 28, 1985;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
and that her mother arrived from Manila only after she filed the cases against
her father.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution tried to corroborate complainant's story with the
testimonies of the other witnesses one of whom was Miguel Margallo,
complainant's cousin.  He testified that
on June 29, 1985 he was told by an aunt, Rosa Margallo, to go to Barangay Binog
because Manuel Batis and his daughter Imelda were having sexual intercourse.  While he brushed this order aside, the
information was again told to him on that same day by his two cousins Edgar and
Ricky, sons and brothers of appellant and complainant, respectively.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Together with his mother, he proceeded to Barangay Binog.  Upon arrival, he found complainant playing jackstones
and appellant, who had just come from gathering tuba, was upstairs.  After carrying a short conversation with
appellant, Miguel Margallo succeeded in persuading him to allow complainant to
go with him in the guise of bringing home rice and fish for their family.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
On cross examination, he testified that while he claimed to be close to his
aunt Salvacion Margallo,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
complainant's mother, he did not know when they started living in Barangay
Binog, he only came to know that they lived in Barangay Binog through her
children and that he never met her since she and her family arrived from
Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">His </span>trip to Barangay Binog in
the morning of June 29, 1985 was his first visit to his aunt's place.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Asked whether complainant ever frequented his house, he replied that she was
prevented by her mother from visiting him.  Imelda's mother was angry at him, and in the four years that they have
lived in Barangay Binog, Imelda never went to their house.  He only saw Imelda whenever the former
passed by the market on her way to school.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The third witness presented by the prosecution was Dr. Ofelia
Soliva, the doctor who examined complainant on June 29, 1985 and whose findings
were contained in a Medical Certificate<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
dated July 3, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significant in her medical examination report were the following
points:</p>

<blockquote><u>Extragenital Physical Exam</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">No
sign of external physical injury.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Genital Exam</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Hymen : Healed lacerations at 6:00 o</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">'</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">clock,
9:00 o'clock, 3:00 o'clock and 1:00 o'clock posi­tions corresponding to the
face of a watch.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Hymenal Orifice : Annular, admits one finger easily, 2 fingers with
slight resistance.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Vaginal Smear</u> : <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Positive

<blockquote><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Conclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> : Genital findings present compatible with sexual intercourse with
man.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Dr. Soliva explained that the hymenal
lacerations which are now merely rounded scars were inflicted long before the
examination, possibly a year ago.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The presence of spermatozoa in complainant's vaginal smear, confirms her having
had sexual intercourse in the days that recently passed but the same was not
through force inasmuch as there was no sign of contusion or external physical
injury.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant contended that at twelve o'clock
noon of June 15, 1985, he found his daughter Imelda Batis with Miguel Margallo
in bed and kissing each other in the house of the latter in Barangay Aringit,
Cavite, West Palo, Leyte.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon seeing him, Miguel Margallo broke the flooring and escaped by passing
under the house.  He then brought his
daughter home to Barangay Binog, Palo, Leyte and due to his anger, whipped her
with coconut palm.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
On that same day, he temporarily transferred his children, including Imelda, to
Barangay Rizal, Dagami, Leyte, in his cousin's (Vicente Magos) place.  They stayed there for nine consecutive
nights, although complainant passed the night in the house of a certain Coring
Bertuldo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As early as when complainant was 8 years old, Miguel Margallo,
who was at that time living with them, started molesting her.  He did not take any legal action against
Miguel Margallo in deference to Miguel's being his wife's nephew.  Since Imelda and Miguel are cousins, it was
not right for them to get romantically involved with each other.  This, according to him, was the very reason
why he wanted to separate them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 25, 1985, they returned to Barangay Binog, Palo, Leyte,
reaching the place at around 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  He left his children for a while to buy some
food from the market but when he came back, complainant was no longer
home.  The next morning, a policeman, together
with Miguel Margallo, fetched him at seven o'clock and since then up to now,
has been imprisoned.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court held that the "x x x testimony of the
complainant Imelda Batis is more credible than the mere denials and avoidance
of the accused and his witnesses.  Her
testimony is straightforward, strong and sufficient to sustain a
conviction".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Findings of the trial court with respect to the credibility of witnesses should
not be disturbed on appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
But in rape cases, this rule should yield to the following basic
principles:  (1) an accusation for rape
can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove, but more difficult for the
person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature
of the crime where only two (2) persons are usually involved, the testimony of
the complainant must be scrutinized with great caution; and (3) evidence for
the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to
draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There are certain facts of substance and value that militate
against an affirmation of the findings of guilt of the trial court,
particularly when the evidentiary rule is recalled that in crimes against
chastity wherein conviction or acquittal depends almost entirely on the
credibility of the complainant's testimony,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
the testimony of the injured woman should not be received with precipitate
credulity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We take note of the following circumstances which detract from
the credibility of complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Both complainant and the
appellant testified that Salvacion Margallo, complainant's mother and
appellant's wife, left for Manila on June 15, 1985.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
It was in the evening of June 15, 1985 that the complainant was allegedly first
raped by appellant.  Yet, complainant
testified that her mother was only about two and a half meters away from her
when the appellant allegedly sexually abused her.  When asked about what her mother's reaction to the incident was,
complainant replied:</p>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you shouted for help calling your mother, "Nanay, Nanay!", was your
mother awaken (sic)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
your mother <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">was </span>awaken (sic),
what did she do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
kept on looking.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When you said your father <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">had </span>sexual intercours <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">(sic) with </span>you on June 15, 1985, what
did your mother do aside from looking at your?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
said "good for you", or (hiyokat in waray dialect).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent:0in">implying that she did not lift a finger to
rescue her daughter or that she even consented to what happened.  Apparently, there are two inconsistencies
arising from this testimony of complainant:  First, how could it have been possible for complainant's mother to be
around at that time when she had already left for Manila in the morning of June
15, 1985?  No evidence whatsoever was
adduced to rebut the statement.  Second,
complainant's mother's reaction and comment are at odds with natural human
experience.  It is unthinkable for a
mother to countenance such an occurrence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">right</span>
before her very eyes.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Having testified that her mother left for Manila on June 15,
1985 and came home only after these cases were already filed,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
therefore it would have been impossible for her mother to be washing clothes in
a nearby house in the evening of June 28, 1985<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
when she claimed she was again raped by her father.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Prescinding from her allegations that her mother was washing
clothes in another house in the evening of June 28, 1985, giving the impression
that the place was not far from where their house was located, what need was

<p class="BODY">4. She testified on cross examination that she served as a cook
at Barangay Dagami, Leyte for one and one half months starting on May 6,

father also lived in the Barangay Captain's house where she was serving as a
cook.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
If these were so, how could she have been raped in the evening of June 15, 1985
in their house in Barangay Binog, Palo, Leyte?</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, We find it
difficult to let our mind rest easy on the certainty of guilt of appellant as
found by the trial court.  Not even the
corroborative testimonies of prosecution witness Miguel Margallo could serve to
cure the inconsistencies in complainant's testimonies.  On the contrary, Miguel Margallo's
testimonies served to cast doubt on complainant's already irrational
statements.  Again, consider the

<p class="BODY">The trial court went on to state that "x x x the fact of
sexual intercourse was substantially corroborated by the medical findings of
Dr. Soliva who conducted the examination.  It goes to show that it is not incredible for a man to rape his own
flesh and blood daughter.  Neither was
it impossible to commit rape in a small space which was occupied by members of
a family especially with a callous mother and the rapist was the father".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn51" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such sweeping statements of the trial court creates the
impression that rape and sexual intercourse mean one and the same thing when in
fact they are not.  That a female <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>found to have had sexual intercourse
does not necessarily mean that she was raped.  In rape, carnal knowledge of a woman by a man must be unlawful.  That is, without her consent and against her
utmost resistance.  The presence or
absence of traces of spermatozoa is immaterial, since it is penetration,
however slight, and not ejaculation, that makes it rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn52" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
The element of force and intimidation is absent in sexual intercourse.  Besides, in sexual intercourse, carnal
copulation of a male and a female usually imply actual penetration of the
organs of the former and latter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn53" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the medical report adds nothing to bolster the
prosecution's claim that complainant was raped by appellant.  Rather, it merely confirms that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>early as one year ago, the complainant
has already engaged in sexual intercourse.  While this confirmation does not discount the possibility that the
appellant could have taken advantage of complainant on the stated dates, the
evidence adduced at the trial is not sufficient to pass the test of moral
certainty which is sufficient to convict the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proof beyond reasonable doubt is required to convict an
accused.  By reasonable doubt is not
meant that which of possibility may arise, but it is that doubt engendered by
an investigation of the whole proof and an inability, after such investigation,
to let the mind rest easy upon the certainty of guilt.  Absolute certainty of guilt is not demanded
by the law to convict one of any criminal charge but moral certainty is
required, and this certainty is required as to every proposition of proof
requisite to constitute the offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn54" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the prosecution failed to overcome the constitutional
presumption of innocence by proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

REVERSED <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span>SET ASIDE.  Accused-appellant Manuel Batis is ACQUITTED
