<p class="BODY">The relevant antecedents are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private complainants Eugenia Galapon, her daughter Marilyn
Fermina Galapon, and the latter's common-law husband, Dominador Acob, were
caretakers of a house located at Barangay 14, Bacarra, Ilocos Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around 6:30 in the evening of September 28, 1989 while the
complainants and other members of their family were watching a home movie, four
armed men appeared on their front porch (azotea).<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Dominador Acob switched on the porch light and saw a gun pointed at him.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
He was told not to be afraid because they were members of <span style="">the </span>NPA and they just wanted to enter
the house and to eat for they were hungry.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Acob complied with the request, opened the front door<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and four men armed with guns, a hand grenade and a knife entered.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Once inside, the four armed men identified in court as the four accused,
searched the house and asked for keys and money.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> When
they were told that the occupants had no money and that the only key they had
was the key to the gate, Edgar Sadang and Arnulfo Sayo grabbed Eugenia Galapon
and Marilyn Galapon and brought them to the second floor of the house.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Sadang demanded money from Marilyn, threatening to rape her and kill her
common-law husband if she refused.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> When
she could not give any, she was taken into one of the rooms by Sadang.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
There, she was sexually assaulted by Sadang.  With a gun pointed at her, he tore open her house dress (duster), ripped
off her panty, forced her to lie down on the bed, went on top of her and had
sexual intercourse with her forcibly, all the while threatening to kill her if
she offered any resistance.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
While this abuse was going on, Eugenia, Marilyn's mother, was made to stand at
the door of the room to witness the rape while she was guarded by Sayo who was
armed with a knife.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> When
Sadang finished taking advantage of Marilyn, he went out of the room and took
Eugenia away from the door.  Sayo, on
the other hand, followed suit and raped Marilyn while threatening to kill her
if she resisted.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Sadang and Sayo brought Marilyn and Eugenia to
another room to look for valuables.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Sadang and Sayo then forcibly opened a wooden trunk ("baul" as is
commonly known in local parlance) and an aparador and took the following items,
viz:  (a) assorted jewelry; (b) clothing
materials; (c) a chainsaw; (d) an electric drill; and (e) two guns, all of
which belonged to the family of Lucia Galapon, owner of the house who was
abroad at that time.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Later, Sadang and Sayo brought Eugenia and Marilyn to the
groundfloor where the two other armed men, later identified as Joel Maligsay
and Leodigario Espinar, were guarding Dominador Acob and the rest of the
family.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The four malefactors continued to search the house and took nine pairs of
earrings, a camera, a home video unit (Betamax) with rewin<span style="">d</span>er, two wristwatches and P3,000.00 in
cash, all belonging to Eugenia and Marilyn Galapon and Dominador Acob from a
bodega and a medicine cabinet.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> They
then assembled the said occupants in the living room and after threatening them
with death if they reported the incident to the police authorities, left the
house at about 11:00 in the evening.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Afraid that the armed men will make good their threat, the
victims did not report the incident to the police.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither did Marilyn Galapon, the rape victim, submit herself for medical
examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two weeks later or on October 16, 1989 to be exact, herein
private complainants were asked to go to the Bacarra Police Station to identify
a suspect apprehended by the police.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> Said

robbed them on September 28, 1989 and as the first robber who raped Marilyn.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Later, they were taken to the PC Headquarters in Camp Juan, Laoag City where
they identified another suspect, Arnulfo Sayo, as one of the armed robbers and
the second robber who raped Marilyn.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> Said

headquarters and in the presence of police investigator, PC Sgt. Monico
Dolloog.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Leodigario Espinar was likewise identified as one of the robbers.  On May 10, 1990, Joel Maligsay was
apprehended and was later on identified in open court by Eugenia and Marilyn
Galapon.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the police authorities recovered the stolen chain
saw and electric drill from the house of one Petronilo Espejo of San Nicolas,
Ilocos Norte who told police investigators that it was Edgar Sadang who offered
the items to him for sale.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing, the court a <i><span style="">quo </span></i>rendered the aforequoted judgment of conviction, hence,
the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in a resolution dated January 31, 1993, the trial court
resolved to dismiss the appeal of accused-appellant Arnulfo Sayo for failure of

In the case at bench, the prosecution has sufficiently established the fact

Court declared that:</span></p>

<blockquote>"The fact that the witness fails to mention a particular
detail of an incident, especially when testifying on different occasions, does
not <i>per se </i>undermine his credibility.  The nature and difference of the proceedings involved and the questions
propounded therein as would or would not succeed in eliciting the details
desired are only some of the factors to be considered.  What is controlling is the consistency of
the witness in relating the significant and indispensable components of the
principal occurrence.  We have held that
a few discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses
referring to minor details, and not in actuality touching upon the basic
aspects of the whys and wherefores of the crime, do not impair their
credibility."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances cited by appellants do not, at all, indicate
fabrication and falsehoods.  At best,
they merely reflect the witness's sincerity, candor, and at times, her
illiteracy.  Thus, despite the minor
inconsistencies in Eugenia's testimony (which we find insignificant and
inconsequential to discuss singly), it is believable on the whole as a coherent
narration of what transpired that evening.  Moreover, assuming <i><span style="">arguendo </span></i>that
Eugenia's version must be disregarded, the same would not result in the
acquittal of the appellants, the said testimony being merely corroborative of
Marilyn's narration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the constitutional presumption of innocence vigorously
invoked by the appellants cannot be applied in the instant case where the guilt
of the accused had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.  It is true that the Bill of Rights
guarantees that any person accused of a criminal offense is presumed innocent
until the contrary is proved,<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a> and
the quantum of evidence required by law to overcome this presumption, and to
justify any criminal conviction is proof beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a>
However, this is not<span style=""> </span>to say that
there should be absolute certainty in every criminal conviction.  What the law requires the prosecution to
adduce is only that degree of proof which produces conviction in an
unprejudiced mind<a style="" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a> or
at least, moral certainty that the offense was committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE, </span></b>premises
