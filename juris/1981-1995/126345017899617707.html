Sanchez and Cesar Cabrera (deceased), represented by wife Sofia Cruz Cabrera,
the Court notes that the record shows that the decision of the Court of
Industrial Relations in Case No. 71-IPA dated November 22, 1968 reads in part
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1) <span class="GramE">That</span> the salary increases granted to the eight (8) top
officials of the NWSA in November, 1965, should be extended to all the
supervisors of the Authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The water
crises of 1966 and 1967 are not sufficient justification for not extending the
salary increase to the supervisors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court grants 35% general increase staggered for three years."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal from said decision having been filed out of time, this
Court declared the same final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And entry of final judgment of this Court's
decision was made on <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before rendering <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision, We
required the NWSA to submit the list of those who would be benefited by the
increase granted by the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Resolution of March 9,
1972, p. 222, Record.)</span> The NWSA submitted a list of 566 employees
including the nine above-named <span class="SpellE">movants</span> (Annex
"B", pp. 234-242, Record), and it was in the light of said
information that <span class="GramE">We</span> rendered Our decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, according to the instant motion, in execution of <span class="GramE">Our</span> judgment, the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>
pertinently ordered on <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="10">October 23,
 1974</st1:date> thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The main question to be resolved by the Court is <span class="GramE">Who</span> are those employees entitled to the benefits of the 35%
increase granted under the decision?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All supervisors, all
members of the NWSA Supervisors Association and/or all the positions listed in
the Collective Bargaining Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner union claims they are those named in the lists submitted by
management and the union, Annexes 'A' and 'B' of their motion, numbering 566
and 922, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Management, on
the other hand, now maintains that they include only those supervisors whose
positions are listed in the CBA, those section chiefs and above numbering 200
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Motion and/or
Manifestation filed by the Government Corporate Counsel dated October 4, 1974)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this regard, the court takes judicial
notice of the Supreme Court Resolution in this case (G.R. No. L-30051) issued
on March 9, 1972, requiring the respondent NWSA and the NWSA Supervisors
Association to submit within five (5) days a <u>stipulation on the number and
average compensation of the members of respondent union who would be benefited
by the decision of the Industrial Court, should the same be affirmed in this
appeal</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
(underscoring supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to
this resolution, both parties submitted their respective list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Management list showed 566 members, while
that of the union was 922.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention of management now,
that only 200 employees are entitled to the increase cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its submission of the list to the Supreme
Court which contains 566 employees as prospective beneficiaries of the decision
in case of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> thereof by said <span class="GramE">court,</span> certainly constitutes an admission of a party in
contemplation of Section 22, Rule 130 of the Rules.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Management is now barred or stopped
from claiming otherwise, <span class="GramE">specially</span> considering that
this was a judicial admission made before the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot now assert that the figure of 566
which it gave the Supreme Court is erroneous, and that the correct number is
only 200 as it now claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Likewise, the figure being claimed by
the union that 922 supervisors/members of the Association are entitled to the
benefits of the decision cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">A verification</span> by this Court reveals that the
list submitted by the Association to the Supreme Court includes names of employees
whose membership came only after the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Representatives of the Association admit that at the time of the
decision, actual membership of the union was only 566 more or less as reflected
in both the union and management records.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Understandably, the membership of the Association swelled to almost
double the original number after the decision, because of the expectancy of a
possible inclusion in the 35% increase of wage granted to petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The court therefore, holds that
only 566 as contained in the list submitted by management are entitled to the
increase.</u>‚Äù (Underscoring Ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="8">August 25,
 1975</st1:date>, the Secretary of Labor modified the NLRC decision in the
following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"With respect to the third assigned error in the Appeal, there
is merit to the contention of respondent NWSA that the eight (8)(should be 9)
top officials who were already granted salary increases (6-Area Manager-42%;
1-Asst. Chief Engineer-49%; 1-Corporate Treasurer-49%) should no longer be
entitled to the 35% staggered wage increases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear from the CIR Decision that these eight (8<span class="GramE">)(</span>should
be 9) top officials who had already been given their salary increases are
excluded from the benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Last paragraph, page 6, Resolution)."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appealed to the Office of the President, that Office rendered a
decision on <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1980</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part reads:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, OP Decision No. 1815 dated February
2, 1976, is hereby modified in the sense that respondent's employees who were
its supervisors <span style="">(excluding </span>the
aforementioned top officials) on November 22, 1968, and who then held
appointments as such, are entitled to the salary increase granted under the
decision of the Court of Industrial Relations dated November 22, 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, the proper MWSS authorities
and its auditor should require the claimant-beneficiaries to present their
appointments as supervisors issued on or before <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1968</st1:date>, before paying their respective
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all other respects, said OP

<p class="BODY">But it should be borne in mind that the decision of the Office of
the President is nothing more than a construction of the judgment of this Court
as to how it should <span style="">be executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And what is important, in this
connection, <span style="">is
</span>that many circumstances have taken place since <span class="GramE">We</span>

<blockquote>"<u>Increases granted to the then NAWASA top officials, herein
<span class="SpellE">movants</span> ANTONIO MENOR, et al., in November, 1965,
were in the nature of promotional or meritorious increases for exemplary and
efficient performance ordained and mandated by Civil Service law, rules and
regulations</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no question that the increases granted to herein <span class="SpellE">movants</span> ANTONIO MENOR, et al., in 1965, as mentioned in the
<span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> portion of the decision were by virtue of
merit and efficiency in the public service as mandated by Civil Service law,
rules and regulations; merit and efficiency being the cornerstone of an efficient
public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To deny then <span class="SpellE">movants</span> ANTONIO MENOR, et al., the subject 35% general
salary increase would render at naught the merit and efficiency rule in the
public service and would undermine the foundation of an efficient public
service at the then NWSA, now MWSS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
may be recalled that in the past there had been a continuing public gripe
against <span class="SpellE">NWSA's</span> inefficiency and a public clamor for a
more efficient water service which prompted the <span class="SpellE">adaption</span>
of an upgraded NWSA pay plan implemented on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Please see penultimate paragraph, p. 8, Motion for Clarification).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But even earlier, or in July, 1967, 1968 and 1969 general
increases were extended to the supervisors and all employees of the NWSA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Please see 2nd par., p. 8,
Motion for Clarification).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
because of the promotional increases granted to herein <span class="SpellE">movants</span>

in July, 1967, 1968 and 1969, as well as in the upgrading of the NWSA pay plan
in September, 1974, so much so that by September, 1974, some of the <span class="SpellE">Movants</span> received lower salaries than their immediate
subordinates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this is not iniquitous,
it is an open disregard of the merit and efficiency rule ordained by Civil
Service law, rules and regulations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>By denying now the 35% general
salary increase to the herein <span class="SpellE">movants</span> ANTONIO MENOR,
et al., the Office of the President not only sanctioned the iniquitous
situation<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it hoped to remedy by such
denial, but also<span style="">&nbsp; </span>overlooked, if not
disregarded, the right<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of said <span class="SpellE">Movants</span> to claim the 35% general salary increase in
consonance with the rulings of this Honorable Court in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
cases of NAMARCO vs. FRISCO Workers Union, et al., and <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span>
Workers Union, et al., vs. <span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span>, etc., et al</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Office of the President, in denying <span class="SpellE">Movants</span>'
Motion for Reconsideration, further opined that to grant the 35% general salary
increase to said <span class="SpellE">movants</span> ANTONIO MENOR, et al., would
not remedy the iniquitous situation, which the subject decision allegedly
sought to cure by equalizing the scale of increases granted to the supervisors
of the NWSA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By such holding, the Office of the President, we submit,
forgot to consider the fact that by EXCLUDING the herein nine (9) Movants from
the general salary increases granted to all employees and supervisors of the
NWSA in July, 1967, 1968 and 1969, and in the upgrading of the NWSA Pay Plan in
September, 1974 as a consequence of which the salaries of some of them (<span class="SpellE">Movants</span>) became <u>less</u> than those of their immediate
subordinates, said <span class="SpellE">Movants</span> were no longer the cause
(as held by the Office of the President) but the victims of such iniquitous
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To deny <span class="GramE">them</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Movants</span>) again the 35% general salary increase
ordained by the defunct <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>
would be adding insult to injury.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>But on top of all this, a liberal
construction <span style="">in </span>favor of <span class="SpellE">movants</span> ANTONIO MENOR, et al., is called for under the
circumstances there being an apparent doubt as to the beneficiaries of the 35%
general salary increase ordained by the defunct Industrial Court</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That there is here some doubt as to the beneficiaries of the
oft-mentioned 35% general salary increase to all supervisors of the NWSA is
beyond question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so because
the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> portion of the subject decision does
not <u>expressly</u> deny NOR grant to <span class="SpellE">Movants</span> the
35% salary increase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There appears to be
a void on this aspect of the <st1:street><st1:address>Industrial Court</st1:address></st1:street>'s
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must have prompted the
mind of this Honorable Supreme Court when it required petitioner and respondent
association to submit to IT the list of those who should be benefited by the
decision of the defunct Industrial Court should the same be affirmed in the
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the resolution of this
Honorable Court issued on March 9, 1972 requiring the petitioner and respondent
association, among others, to submit the list of supervisors who would be benefited
by the decision of the Industrial Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Please see paragraph 2, page 2, Motion for Clarification)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In compliance with said resolution, both parties submitted the
required list; the list submitted by petitioner included all the herein nine
(9) <span class="SpellE">Movants</span>, likewise respondent association included
the nine (9) <span class="SpellE">Movants</span> in its list.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, insofar as both parties are
concerned, there is a judicial admission on their part that the nine (9) <span class="SpellE">Movants</span> must also be made beneficiaries of the 35% general
salary increase, thus prompting the National Labor Relations Commission,
successor of the defunct Industrial Court, to rule that NWSA is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from opposing the grant to the nine (9) <span class="SpellE">Movants</span> of the 35% general salary increase ordained by the
subject decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should now be
unquestionable, therefore, that the <u>mutual</u> lists (566 members in all)
submitted by petitioner and respondent association to this Honorable Supreme
Court pursuant to its resolution of March 9, 1972, must be deemed included as
part and parcel of the subject decision when the same was held as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> by this Honorable Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is submitted that the foregoing legal stance in the light
of the above discussion is in consonance with the spirit and substance in statutory
and judicial interpretation to the effect that in case of doubt in
labor-management relations, the doubt, as mandated by the Constitution, must
always be resolved in favor of the workingman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That a doubt here exists, we contend, is sufficiently pointed out in the
foregoing discussions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, the relevance for a liberal construction of labor <span style="">statute</span>s<span style=""> </span>in favor of the worker."</span> <span class="GramE">(Pp.
358-362, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We cannot close <span class="GramE">Our</span> eyes to the inequity
to herein <span class="SpellE">movants</span> if the interpretative decision of
the Office of the President is to be followed to the letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Succinctly stated, the absurd situation that
would result would be that just because the Court of Industrial Relations found
it but proper to improve the situation of the other supervisors so that their
salaries may approximate those of the nine <span class="SpellE">movants</span>,
the said nine <span class="SpellE">movants</span>' salaries would in consequence
be pegged to the increased amounts given them prior to the decision of the
Industrial Court affirmed by Us no matter if subsequent promotions and <span class="SpellE">upgradings</span> are given to the other employees over and above
the equalization process resulting from Our decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the general <span class="SpellE">upgradings</span>
and promotions extended in July 1967, 1968 and 1969 to the other supervisors
and employees of NWSA none of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> were
included, so much so that by 1969, those who were receiving salaries less than
the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> in 1965, were promoted and received
higher salaries than the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not and could not have contemplated
such inequity and unfairness in <span class="GramE">Our</span> decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, We hold that, there being no
clear showing that the salary increase in 1965 were exactly equivalent to the
35% increase granted to the others, it is but fair that they be given the
difference if any; and, further, in that <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
should not have been excluded in the 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1974 increases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>In view of all the foregoing</b>, in the exercise of Our
prerogative to make the execution and implementation of Our final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision fair and just to all concerned, in the
light of the circumstances that have intervened in the meanwhile, it is hereby
ordered that the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority adjust the salaries
of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> (their retirements, if they have
already retired) in line with the foregoing opinion.</p>
