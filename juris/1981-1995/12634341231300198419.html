				<H3>RODOLFO ENCARNACION, PETITIONER, VS. DYNASTY

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This refers to the appeal from the October 24 and November 20,
1978 Orders of the then Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XI, at that
time presided over by the Honorable Elias B. Asuncion, dismissing the complaint
on the ground that the case is principally a labor case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1975,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>petitioner was employed as a projectionist by
respondent Dynasty Amusement Center of which the other respondents are
officers.  On September 29, 1978,
petitioner filed a complaint for damages with the then Court of First Instance
of Manila, alleging among others, that he was suspended or had been disallowed
to work and that was made the subject of harrassment and slanderous
accusations.  Respondents filed a motion
to dismiss the complaint on the ground that respondent court has no
jurisdiction over the nature of the case as it involves a labor dispute which
pertains exclusively to the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without waiting for respondent court to resolve their motion to
dismiss, respondents filed their answer dated October 16, 1978, wherein they
averred that the suspension of petitioner from work is a prerogative of
management <span style="">so </span>as to impose
discipline among employees, said right being recognized under the New Labor
Code of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 24, 1978, the trial court issued <span style="">its </span>Order dismissing the case on the
ground that it has jurisdiction over the nature of the case <span style="">(p. </span>44, Rollo).  The subsequent motion for reconsideration
was denied by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> on November 20, 1978 (p. 54, <u><span style="">id</span></u><span style="">.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that the case is more of one for damages and
thus is a civil dispute.  Besides, he
claims, reinstatement is not prayed for.  Petitioner further contends that respondents had already waived and are
estopped from questioning the trial court's jurisdiction when <span style="">they </span><span style="">filed their answer seeking affirmative </span>reliefs.</p>

<p class="BODY">When this case was filed, the applicable law was Section 1 of
Presidential Decree No. 1367, which provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.  Paragraph
(a) of Article 217 of the Labor Code, as amended, is hereby further amended to
read as follows: </blockquote>

<blockquote>a).  The Labor Arbiter shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and decide the following cases involving all workers,
whether agricultural or non agricultural:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.15in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Unfair labor practice cases;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Unresolved cases in collective bargaining, including those
which involve <span style="">wages, hours </span>of
work and other terms and conditions of employment; and</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->All other cases arising from employer-employee relations duly
indorsed by the Regional Directors in accordance with the provisions of this
code; Provided, that the Regional <span style="">Directors
shall </span>not indorse and Labor Arbiters <span style="">shall </span>not entertain claims for <span style="">moral </span>or other forms of damages."</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the amendatory provisions of Presidential Decree No.
1691, which took effect during the pendency of this case, ousted respondent
court of the jurisdiction it initially had under Presidential Decree No.
1367.  Jurisdiction over all money
claims, including claims for damages arising from or in connection with
employer-employee relations, is now vested exclusively in the Labor Arbiters of
the National Labor Relations Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question now is whether or not Presidential Decree No. 1691
has a retroactive effect to cover the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">This query was resolved in the case of <u>Atlas</u> <u>Fertilizer</u>
<u>Corp.</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Navarro</u>, (149 SCRA 432) wherein We <span style="">ruled: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"In conflicts of </span>jurisdiction
between the courts and the labor agencies arising from the amendments <span style="">effected </span>by P.D. 1691 on P.D. 1367,
this Court held in the cases of Ebon v. De Guzman (113 <span style="">SCRA 52), Aguda v. Vallejos (113 SCRA 69), and Sentinel </span>insurance
Co., <span style="">Inc. vs. Bautista, </span>(<u>supra</u>),
that P.D. 1691 is a curative statute which corrected the lack of jurisdiction <span style="">of </span>Labor Arbiter at <span style="">the </span>start of the proceedings and,
therefore, should be given a restrospective application to the pending
proceedings.  P.D. 1691 merely restored
a jurisdiction earlier <span style="">vested </span>in
Labor Arbiters <span style="">before the </span>enactment
of P.D. 1367.  It was intended to
correct a situation <span style="">where </span>two
tribunals would have <span style="">jurisdiction over </span>separate
issues arising from the same <span style="">labor </span>conflict.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x  <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>This construction of law <span style="">is
</span>not new.  <span style="">It </span>must <span style="">be noted </span>that
the amendatory provision of P.D. 1367 itself was give<span style=""> retroactive application, </span>for also being curative in nature.</blockquote>

<blockquote>P.D. 1691 should, therefore, be given a retroactive application to
this pending case as the precise purpose of the amendment was to hopefully
settle once and for all the conflict of jurisdiction between regular courts and
labor agencies (Sentinel Ins., Co. vs. Bautista, <u>supra</u>)."<u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the cases of <u>Getz</u> <u>Corporation</u> <u>Phils.</u> <u>vs.</u>
<u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u> (116 SCRA 86), <u>PLDT</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Dulay</u>
(172 SCRA 33) and <u>Polotan-Tuvera</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Dayrit</u> (160 SCRA
423), the Court also declared that Presidential Decree No. 1691 is a curative
statute with retrospective application to pending proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <u>Abad</u>
</span><u>vs.</u> <u><span style="">RTC</span></u><span style=""> <u>of</u> <u>Manila</u> (154 SCRA </span>664,
671), the Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"However, whereas before jurisdiction over money <span style="">claims </span>of laborers and employees
appertained to Courts of First Instance, the same are now to be taken
cognizance of by proper authorities in the Department of Labor and Employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The rule of adherence of jurisdiction until a cause is
finally resolved or adjudicated does not apply when the change in jurisdiction
is curative in character.  Thus in the
instant case, there is nothing wrong in holding that Courts of First
Instance/Regional Trial Courts no longer have jurisdiction over aforesaid
monetary claims of labor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is, therefore, unmeritorious for the complaint
clearly shows that the petitioner's claim for damages arose from the acts
attributed to his employer, while he was still an employee thereof.  Thus, the action for damages arose from an
employer-employee relationship.  We do
not agree with petitioner that the case is a civil dispute simply because he
did not ask for reinstatement, for an employee need not seek reinstatement in
order to file a complaint before the labor arbiter (<u>A.</u> <u>Consteel</u> <u>Construction</u>
<u>Co.,</u> <u>Inc.</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Intermediate</u> <u>Appellate</u> <u>Court</u>,
G.R. No. 64673, Oct. 21, 1988).  More
so, estoppel cannot attach by virtue of Section 2, Rule 9 of the Revised Rules
of Court, inasmuch as the question of <u>compentencia</u> maybe raised even for
the first time on appeal, apart from the fact <span style="">that jurisdictional </span>issues can <span style="">never be waived.  Besides, the
issue of jurisdiction </span>was <span style="">raised
even </span>before the <span style="">answer was
filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby DISMISSED and <span style="">the order appea</span>led fr<span style="">om AF</span>F<span style="">I</span><span style="">RMED.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
