made the victim fall forward on the backrest of a bench.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by two more karate blows
that crumpled him to the cement floor where he lay prostrate and
motionless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <span class="SpellE">Centeno's</span>
order, two policemen then picked up <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>

<p class="BODY">Villanueva corroborated <span class="SpellE">Violago</span> and
said he cried out, "Why are you doing this to my friend?" when he saw
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> being mauled by <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also
declared that <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> was felled
with three karate blows from <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This witness claimed he got a glass of water

not drink it any more as he was already dying then. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>He felt <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>'s
pulse but there was none.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He opened <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>'s
shirt and put his ear to his chest but could hear no heartbeat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said that the other persons who witnessed
the killing, besides the policemen, were <span class="SpellE">Violago</span>, <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> <span class="SpellE">Salao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Serafin</span> <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span>theory of the
defense was that <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> was so
intoxicated that he reeled and fell and hit his head and suffered the internal
brain hemorrhage that killed him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
support this claim, it introduced Mercedes Bautista, chief forensic chemist of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">NBI, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">who </span>testified that at the time of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>'s
death he had 0.21% of alcohol in his blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She declared on cross-examination that the effect of such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">quantity would vary according to the person's
physical condition although there would surely be emotional instability in
every case.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

heard the alleged sound, considering the thick concrete walls of the room and
the fact that they were then some ten meters away.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is also the
argument that no external injuries were found </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the nape of the neck, where the karate blows were administered although
there were abrasions and contusions elsewhere in the victim's head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As Dr. Vidal explained, however, even if no
marks were left on the neck, karate blows thereon could cause the generalized
and extensive bleedings that caused the victim's death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will you please explain,
if a karate blow delivered on the nape of a person without necessarily
producing contusions or abrasions will cause brain hemorrhage?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Depending
on the position of the fist that one will apply on the person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A karate blow will produce inner injury but
without any outside injury especially this portion of the hand, (witness
pointing to the <span class="SpellE">hypothenar</span>) unlike this portion
(witness pointing to the knuckles) and especially when the karate blows
delivered with the <span class="SpellE">hypothenar</span> on a muscular portion
of the body like the nape, there will be no external injuries but the injury is
internal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To further explain, I will
cite to you an example.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The boxers who
use gloves on their hands and when they will deliver blows on a person, that
person will not sustain external injuries but there is severe injury inside the
brain and that could justify that karate blows will not produce external
injuries but internal injuries.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

by treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As for the mitigating
circumstances claimed by the defense, the Court holds that they cannot be
allowed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The derogatory statement made
