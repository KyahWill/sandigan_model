<p class="NUM">(3) in awarding interest and attorney's fees in favor of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We turn to the first
alleged error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As noted earlier, <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> had alleged in its answer that it had no knowledge
or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations
made by PNB in its complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>, in other words, purported to deny those
allegations and hence now contends that it had generated an issue of fact which
the trial court should have first passed upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>, however, cannot be deemed to have
denied the allegations of the amended complaint, considering that the truth of
those allegations relating to the execution of the surety bond and the contents
thereof was peculiarly within the knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>
being the <u>issuer</u> of the bond and Endorsement No. B-60-3 itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Equitable Banking Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span></u>,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> the Supreme Court rejected out of hand the
same argument which <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> now seeks to make:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>This pretense is manifestly devoid of merit</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the Rules of Court permit a litigant
to file an answer alleging lack of knowledge to form a belief as to the truth
of certain allegations in the complaint, <u>this form of denial ‘must be availed
of with sincerity and in good faith</u>, -- <u>certainly neither for the
purpose of delay</u>.’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it has
been held that <u>said </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">mode of
denial is unavailing ‘where the fact as to which want of knowledge is asserted
is to the knowledge of the court so plainly and necessarily within the
defendant's knowledge that his averment of ignorance must be palpably untrue</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.’ Thus, under conditions almost identical to
those obtaining in the case at bar, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, upheld a judgment on the pleadings in Capitol
Motors vs. <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>
(G.R. No. L-28140, March 19, 1970) from which we quote:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“‘We agree with the defendant-appellant that one of the modes of
specific denial contemplated in Section 10, Rule 8, is a denial by stating that
the defendant is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief
as to the truth of a material averment in the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">however, is whether paragraph 2 of defendant-appellant's answer
constitutes a specific denial under the said rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not think so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Warner Barnes &amp; Co. Ltd. vs. Reyes, et
al. G.R. No L-9531, May 14, 1958 (103 Phil. 662), this Court said that <u>the
rule</u> authorizing an answer to the effect that the defendant has no
knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of an
averment and giving such answer the effect of a denial, <u>does not apply where
the fact as to which want of knowledge is asserted, is so plainly and

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At
the same time that <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> pretended to have denied
the allegations of <span class="SpellE">PNB's</span> amended complaint, it
admitted in the </span>affirmative defense section of its answer that it had
indeed executed the Surety Bond and Endorsement No. B-60-3 in favor of PNB; <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> must be deemed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the Bond and the Endorsement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
affirmative defense in fact consisted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of
</span>pleading the very provisions of the Surety Bond upon which PNB based its
cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the issues raised
by the amended complaint and the answer were not genuine issues of fact on
which evidence would have had to be submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those pleadings raised, rather, questions concerning the proper
interpretation of the provisions of the Surety Bond and Endorsement No. B-60-3,
i.e., the determination of whether the surety bond and the endorsement had, as
contended by the PNB, guaranteed the payment by <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>
Lumber of its P25,000.00 loan from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">PNB;
</span>or whether, as maintained by <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>, the
surety bond and its endorsement served merely to secure the performance of the
terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit No. 14-10272.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold, therefore, that under these
circumstances, the trial court correctly rendered judgment on the pleadings.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We turn to the second
error imputed by <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> to the trial court:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the judgment on the pleadings, while it may
have been within the jurisdiction of the trial court, was prematurely
issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This argument appears to us even
more tenuous than the first assigned error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> claims that the trial court should
have withheld judgment on the </span>pleadings until after the third party
action brought by <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> against the owner of <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> Lumber on the indemnity <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">agreement executed between them, had gone forward to </span>judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third party complaint could, of course,
have been prosecuted quite separately from the principal action between PNB and
<span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, there was no reason at all why the trial court should have
deferred rendering judgment on the pleadings in the principal action,
considering that the PNB <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>not
interested at all in the outcome of the third party complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 12, Rule 6 of the Revised Rules
of Court, the purpose of a third party complaint is to enable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>defending party to obtain
contribution, indemnity, subrogation or other relief from a person not a party
to the action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, notwithstanding the
judgment on the pleadings, <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">could </span>still proceed with the
prosecution of its third party complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before passing on to the third error assigned by <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>, it is important to note that <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>
did not really dispute the correctness of the conclusion reached by the trial
court in respect of the substantive issue raised before it:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether the bond issued by <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> secured the obligations of <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>
Lumber to repay the P25,000.00 loan obtained from PNB, or whether the bond had
secured the Letter of Credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court held that the surety bond was intended to secure the repayment of <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> Lumber's loan from PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We believe and so hold that the trial court
was correct in so holding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first
place, the surety bond explicitly stated that the P25,000.00 loan was being
secured by the bond:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is a special provision of this undertaking to guarantee
the full payment of a loan not to exceed TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PESOS
(P25,000.00) that may be granted by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Philippine
National Bank to <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> Lumber."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In
the second place, while the bond and the endorsement had referred to the Letter
of Credit, <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> Lumber had <u>no</u> obligations
under the Letter of Credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As noted
earlier, <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> Lumber was <u>beneficiary-assignee</u>
of the Letter of Credit. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Utassco's</span> view would reduce the terms and conditions of the
Surety Bond to nonsense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such view would
also mean that <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>, in its own reading of the
bond, was <u>never at risk</u> since there were <u>no</u> obligations to secure
and that <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> was in fact collecting premiums for
issuing the bond under which it had </span>no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">liabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The principle of
effectiveness is basic in contract interpretation:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>where two (2) interpretations of the same
contract language are </span>possible, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">one
interpretation having the effect of rendering the contract meaningless (and one
of the parties merely dishonest for receiving consideration <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
without parting with any), while the other interpretation would give effect to
the contract as a whole, the latter interpretation must be adopted.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the instant case, the
reference to the Letter of Credit in the surety bond and the endorsement was
either merely inadvertent <span class="SpellE">surplusage</span> or,
alternatively, merely indication of ineptness on the part of the draftsman </span>of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>bond and the endorsement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not disputed by <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>the endorsement was
intended to replace the final <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">paragraph
of the original bond, which paragraph limited the life of the bond to one year
from issuance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The endorsement had the
important effect of giving the bond continuing life so long as "the
account" remained unpaid and outstanding on the books of PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The term "account" here could only
refer to the account of the principal debtor, <span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span>
Lumber, with PNB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The endorsement also
made it clear that the liability </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lanuza</span> Lumber and <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>
was joint and several in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">nature, and
that <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> had waived any benefit of <span class="SpellE">excussion</span> that it might otherwise have had.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on a very practical level, it is
difficult to understand how <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> could have
reasonably supposed that its bond in the amount of RPP25,000.00 was intended
only (or even principally) to secure performance of the obligations of the
issuer -- Kangyo Bank - under the Letter of Credit which had a face value of
US$28,150.00, many times the face value of the bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We come to the final
error assigned by <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the trial court should not </span>have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">granted interest and attorney's fees in favor
of PNB, considering the clause in the endorsement limiting the liability of <span class="SpellE">Utassco</span> to P25,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The issue here presented is not a new one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was extensively discussed and <span class="SpellE">Utassco's</span> submission decisively rejected by this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Plaridel</u></span><u> Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. v.

the Court held:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner objects to the payment of interest and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">attorney's </span>fees because:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) they were not mentioned in the bond; and
(2) the surety would become liable for more than the amount stated in the
contract of <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In support of its objection petitioner dwells on the
proposition that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">a </span>surety's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">liability can not be extended beyond the
terms of his undertaking, citing articles 1956 and 2208 of the New Civil Code
which provide </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">follows:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'ART. 1956.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No interest
shall be due unless it has been expressly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">stipulated
in writing.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'ART. 2208.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence
of stipulation, attorney's fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial
costs, cannot be recovered, except:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.'<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>The objection has to be overruled</u>, because<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">far back as the year 1922 this Court held in <span class="SpellE">Tagawa</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Aldanese</span>, 43 Phil. 852, that <u>creditors suing
on a <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span> bond may recover from the surety as
part of their damages, interest at the legal rate even if the surety would
thereby become liable to pay more than the total amount stipulated in the bond</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘<u>The theory is that interest is allowed
only by way of damages for delay upon the part of the sureties in making
payment after they should have done</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In some states, the interest has been charged from the date of the
judgment of the appellate court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this
jurisdiction, we rather prefer to follow the general practice which is to order
that interest begin to run from the date when the complaint was filed in court,
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.'</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Such theory aligned with Sec. 510 of the Code of Civil Procedure
which was subsequently recognized in the Rules of Court (Rule 53, Section 6)
and with Article 1108 of the Civil Code (now Art. 2209 of the New Civil Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In other words <u>the surety is made to pay interest, not by
reason of the contract, but by reason of its failure to pay when demanded and
for having </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">compelled the
plaintiff to resort to the courts to obtain payment</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
should be observed that interest does not run from the time the obligation
became due, but from the filing of the complaint.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“As to attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Before the enactment of the New Civil Code, successful litigants could
not recover attorney's fees as part of the damages they suffered by reason of
the litigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if the party paid
thousands of pesos to his lawyers, he could not charge the amount to his
opponent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, <u>the New Civil Code permits recovery of attorney's
fees in eleven cases enumerated in Article 2208, among them ‘where the court
deem it just and equitable that attorney's fees and expenses</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> of litigation should be recovered’ or<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘when the defendant acted in gross and
evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff's plainly valid, just
and demandable claim.’ This gives the courts discretion in apportioning
attorney's fees</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Now, considering, in this case, that the principal debtor had
openly and expressly admitted his liability under the bond, and the surety knew
it (p. 123 R.A.), we can not say there was abuse of lower court's discretion in
the way of awarding fees, specially when the indemnity agreement x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> afforded the surety adequate
protection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(100 Phil. 681-682)."
