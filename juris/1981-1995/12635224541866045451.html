This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Albay, 10th Judicial District, Branch III, convicting Leonardo Alamo, 
Leopoldo Arnaldo, Teodulo Rocelo, Rosadinio Bañares and Rogelio Logronio
 of the crime of multiple rape. The dispositive portion of the decision 
reads:
<blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the Court finds the defendants Leonardo Alamo, 
Leopoldo Arnaldo, Teodulo Rocelo, Rosadinio Bañares and Rogelio Logronio
 guilty of rape and sentences each of them to reclusion perpetua; each 
to pay Eunice Fortuna Aragon the sum of P3,000.00 as moral damages and 
each to pay one-fifth of the costs. Credit the defendants with the time 
they have undergone preventive imprisonment."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The information dated December 11, 1972 against the five (5) accused 
based on the complaint filed by Armando Aragon for and in behalf of his 
12-year old daughter, Eunice Aragon, charges:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 20th day of November 1972 in the City of 
Legaspi, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the above-named accused, by means of intimidation and force and 
with lewd designs, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and 
feloniously help one another in having carnal knowledge, one after 
another, with one EUNICE FORTUNA ARAGON, against the latter's will. </p>
  <p> "Contrary to law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The prosecution's evidence is summarized in the People's Brief, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "At about 3:30 o'clock in the afternoon of November 20, 1972, 
Eunice Aragon and her 7-year old sister, Nancy, were at the Team 
Theater, Legaspi Port, Legaspi City, viewing the movie advertisements. 
An ice cream vendor, later identified as Rosadinio Bañares, approached 
them and offered ice cream. At first they refused the offer but when 
Bañares insisted and threatened them, they accepted the ice cream. 
Subsequently, Bañares told them to go to the nipa swamp at Bitano, 
Legaspi City the same time promising to give them P1.00. Again the girls
 refused. However, because of the threats of Bañares that if they did 
not go to the nipa swamp he would hurt them, the two girls fearfully 
obeyed him (pp. 4-7, tsn, May 16, 1973). </p>
  <p> They walked to the nipa swamp. Eunice was ahead followed closely 
by her sister Nancy, and Bañares (pp. 21, 25-26, 55, tsn, May 16, 1973).
 </p>
  <p> When they reached the nipa swamp, Bañares told the girls to enter a
 thicket but they refused, so Bañares pushed them inside (p. 7, tsn, 
Id.). Bañares then told Eunice to remove her panties. When she refused 
to do so, Bañares held her waist and removed them himself. At this 
juncture Eunice kept on struggling to free herself from his hold. Eunice
 then fell on her back. Immediately, Bañares placed himself on top of 
her, put out his penis and inserted it into her vagina. Eunice pushed 
Bañares but her efforts were futile. She could not scream because 
Bañares gagged her mouth. During the sexual intercourse, Eunice felt 
pain on her waist. (pp. 8-9, 29-30, tsn, Id.). </p>
  <p> After Bañares had satisfied her lust, he left. After a while, 
Eunice stood up and put on her panties. Not long thereafter, another man
 identified later as appellant Teodulo Rocelo appeared and pushed Eunice
 down causing her to fall on her back. Rocelo then took off his pants 
and removed her panties, and had sexual intercourse with her. Although 
she felt some pain while she was being criminally abused by Rocelo she 
did not say anything to him because she was afraid. After consumating 
his beastly desires, Rocelo threatened Eunice and told her not to talk 
about the incident to anybody (pp. 11-13, 33-35, tsn, Id.). </p>
  <p>
  While Rocelo was having sexual intercourse with Eunice, another man, 
identified later as appellant Leonardo Alamo, was waiting outside the 
nipa swamp. When Rocelo left, he entered the nipa swamp and upon seeing 
Eunice, who at the time was still lying down, immediately placed himself
 on top of Eunice. Eunice struggled hard to free herself, but appellant 
Alamo pinned her down by holding her waist. Eunice cried. Said appellate
 consummated the sexual act with Eunice. Before leaving her, she was 
warned not to report the matter to her parents, otherwise she would be 
'boxed' (pp. 13-15, tsn, Id.).
  </p>
  <p>
  After appellant Alamo, came another man, later identified as appellant
 Rogelio Logronio arrived. Immediately said appellant placed himself on 
top of Eunice who was still lying down on her back. She told him to get 
out and kicked him with her right foot. However, Logronio succeeded in 
having carnal knowledge of her. Said appellant left after warning her 
not to tell anybody about the matter otherwise he would 'box' her (pp. 
15-16, tsn, Id.).
  </p>
  <p>
  Eunice then stood up. A few moments thereafter, another man, later 
identified as appellant Leopoldo Arnaldo, arrived and pushed her. Again 
she fell flat on her back. Arnaldo placed himself on top of her. Eunice 
pushed him and told him to go away. But appellant nevertheless succeeded
 in having sexual intercourse with her. Like his co-appellants, Arnaldo 
warned Eunice not to tell anybody of what happened (pp. 17-19, tsn, 
Id.).
  </p>
  <p>
  After Leopoldo Arnaldo left, Eunice went home but did not report her 
harrowing experience to her parents because she was afraid (pp. 19-20, 
tsn, Id.).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While the case was pending appeal with Us, four (4) of the accused, 
namely, Leonardo Alamo, Leopoldo Arnaldo, Teodulo Rocelo and Rogelio 
Logronio, withdrew their appeal, which We allowed in Our resolution of 
December 17, 1976 (Rollo, p. 238) hence the judgment as to said accused 
has become final and executory. Only the appeal of the accused Rosadinio
 Bañares remains.
</p><p>
The said accused-appellant Bañares submits the following assignment of errors in his appeal:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  The lower court erred in giving credence to the testimony of the
 alleged offended party when the same is saturated with inconsistencies 
and improbabilities;
  </p>
  <p> 2.  The lower court erred in making a conclusion that threats and 
intimidation were employed by all the accused in succeeding to have 
sexual intercourse with the alleged offended party; </p>
  <p>
    3.  The lower court erred in not acquitting the accused from the charge against them.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The fact that there was sexual intercourse is not denied by 
accused-appellant. What this Court is called upon to decide is whether 
or not force or intimidation was used when the accused had sexual 
intercourse with the victim, so as to qualify the crime as rape. Such 
issue was also the issue raised before the trial court and said court 
ruled that rape was committed, there being force or intimidation in the 
consummation of the crime.
</p><p>
We find no reason to depart from the trial court's judgment of 
conviction. The appeal of the accused must fall. The weight of evidence 
to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt has been 
clearly shown by the prosecution.
</p><p>
The main thrust of accused-appellant's argument is that there was no 
force or intimidation employed on the girl and in fact the girl 
consented to have sexual intercourse with him and that it was the girl 
who asked P1.00 from him as consideration of the sexual cohabitation.
</p><p>
We find no merit in appellant's contention. The records are very clear 
that Eunice never consented to the sexual intercourse. That she was 
intimidated and forced by the accused so that she would submit to his 
lustful desires is clearly shown in her testimony, as follows:

<p>
Considering the tender age of the complainant who was then only 12 years
 old at the time of the commission of the offense, We hold that the 
force employed by the accused-appellant as narrated in her testimony 
above-quoted was sufficient to instill fear in her, compelling her to go
 with him to the swamp and there submit to the lustful desires of the 
accused after she failed in her struggle to free and remove herself from
 him who held her at the waist, causing her to fall to the ground 
whereupon he was able to insert his penis in her private parts, thus 
consummating the sexual act with her. This Court’s ruling, applied in 
many cases of rape, that "it is not necessary that the force employed 
against the complaining woman in rape be as great or of such charac­ter 
as will not be resisted. It is sufficient that the force used is 
sufficient to consummate the culprit's purpose of copulating with the 
offended woman" (People vs. Savellano, 57 SCRA 320, citing U.S. vs. 
Villarosa, 4 Phil. 434, 437 cited in 52 C.J. 1018, note 7; Decision of 
Supreme Court of Spain dated May 14, 1878, 3 Viada, Codigo Penal 452; II
 Hidalgo Codigo Penal 302). The force or violence necessary in rape is 
naturally a relative term, depending on the age, size and strength of 
the parties and their relation to each other (7 C.J.S. 475), is 
specifically applicable in the case at bar. We reiterate it here, as We 
recently applied it in the case of People vs. Buenaventura Baylon, G.R. 
No. 56877, promulgated April 27, 1984.
</p><p>
We have indicated earlier that four (4) of the other accused, namely 
Leonardo Alamo, Leopoldo Arnaldo, Teodulo Rocelo, and Rogelio Logronio, 
withdrew their appeal, thereby rendering their conviction final and 
executory. This fact of withdrawal must have been prompted by a strong 
sense of guilt and repentance, and upon a realization that the evidence 
of the prosecution is overwhelming, and that of the defense, weak in the
 extreme. (People vs. Carreon y Viray, 99 SCRA 473).
</p><p>
Appellant claims that it was the complainant who asked P1.00 from him 
and in return submitted her body voluntarily to him. This claim which is
 stoutly denied by the complainant is not only flimsy but also 
preposterous and outrageous for it adds insult to injury. No sane and 
sensible man will justify his lust upon a tender child of 12 by paying 
her the measly sum of P1.00 unless he is himself so corrupt in his life 
and debased in his moral virtues. There is no showing that the 
complainant girl belongs to or practices the so-called oldest profession
 and even so, no prostitute, however young or aged, sells her flesh as 
cheap as that.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the judgment of conviction 
rendered by the lower court finding the accused-appellant Rosadinio 
Bañares guilty of rape and sentencing him to imprisonment of <em>reclusion perpetua </em>and to pay Eunice Fortuna Aragon the amount of Three Thousand Pesos as moral damages is hereby AFFIRMED.
</p><p>
Cost <em>de oficio</em>.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Aquino, Escolin</em>, and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr.,</em> and <em>Abad Santos, JJ.</em>, concur that the damages should be increased to P30,000.
