<p class="BODY">In this petition for review, the petitioner assigned eight (8)
errors which may be compressed into three (3) <span class="GramE">propositions,
that</span> the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> erred in finding:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. <span class="GramE">that</span> <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span>
was a director of NPDC, hence a public official within its jurisdiction for his
designation by <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span>director of NPDC, Inc. was
invalid;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. <span class="GramE">that</span> the money covered by the
certificate of time deposit was government funds; and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3. <span class="GramE">that</span> he employed deceit in executing
an affidavit falsely alleging that he had authority to dispose of NPDC funds
when in fact he did not have such authority.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All these issues are factual, hence, not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
in a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court where only legal
issues may be raised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span> findings appear to be fully supported by
the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Confirmatory of that fact
are the issuances made by <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span> from <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1981</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1982</st1:date> which <span class="GramE">were</span> all made on official stationery of NPDC (not NPDC,
Inc.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The promissory notes which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>executed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. </span>D and E) in obtaining loans
from <span class="SpellE">Philtrust</span> and the deeds of assignment (of the
certificate of deposit) which he made in favor of <span class="SpellE">Philtrust</span>
were signed by him as "Director of NPDC." His affidavit stated that
he was "the Director of the National Parks Development Committee."
Since NPDC is a government agency under the Office of the President, <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span>, as director of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">that </span>agency, was a government official.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
had jurisdiction over him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 4, PD
No. 1606.)</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The designation of <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span> as Acting
Director of NPDC, Inc., was found by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
to be an error resulting from Vice-Chairman <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
Valencia's apparent inability to distinguish between the NPDC and NPDC, Inc.
and his using both names interchangeably.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No mere designation by <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could make <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span> a director of NPDC, Inc. for the
directors of the corporation had to be elected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His "designation" was therefore invalid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Presumably, it was the realization of the
invalidity of the first designation that prompted <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to issue his subsequent Order No. 76 designating <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span>
as director of NPDC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This later
designation superseded the first.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The check of the Philippine Tourism Authority, a government
agency, was issued to NPDC, also a government agency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the funds were public funds
subject to audit by COA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
conversion by <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span> to his own use through
unfaithfulness and false pretenses constituted <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Witness Elisa <span class="SpellE">Malig</span> (NPDC Chief
Cashier) testified that <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span>, as director, had no
authority to borrow or withdraw NPDC funds except upon voucher of NPDC duly
approved by COA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not even the
Vice-Chairman <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
could borrow or withdraw said funds (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="9">Sept. 26, 1986</st1:date>, pp. 12, 19-20).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Perlas</span>' use of a
forged Secretary's Certificate and a self-serving affidavit, falsely alleging
that he was authorized to dispose of NPDC funds constituted deceit which
enabled him to use the <span class="SpellE">NPDC's</span> time deposit
certificate for his private advantage.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding no reversible error in the lower court's conclusions, <span class="GramE">We</span> affirm the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, We perceive an error in the court's computation of the
additional penalty of temporary special disqualification [eleven (11) years and
one (1) day to twelve (12) years and four (4) months] imposed by it on <span class="SpellE">Perla<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">s</span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The medium period of said additional <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">penalty </span>under Article 214 of the
Revised Penal Code should be a straight term within the period of eleven (11)
years and one (1) day to twelve (12) years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
is affirmed except the penalty of temporary special disqualification imposed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>the accused which should be for a
period of twelve (12) years in each of the three cases of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the petitioner</p>
