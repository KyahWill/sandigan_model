money alleged to be due to her as their partner in <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Two years after issues had
been joined but the case still <span class="SpellE">unterminated</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span> asked the Court to appoint Ramona Merced as receiver

assets of the partnership were being squandered by mismanagement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court, thru Judge <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span>

the receivership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reason given:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the partnership was no longer in existence
because its term of ten years expired in 1967.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Judge Rafael T. <span class="GramE">Mendoza,</span> granted the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, Judge <span class="SpellE">Dimalanes</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Buissan</span> who succeeded Judge Mendoza reconsidered the
latter's action by reinstating the receivership in his order dated </span><st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">June 6,
 1974</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In the order dated </span><st1:date year="1974" day="13" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">June 13,
 1974</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> (Annex L),
Judge <span class="SpellE">Buissan</span> explained why he reinstated the
receivership:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The order of Honorable Judge Mendoza terminating the
receivership appears to be premised on the fact that the partnership known as
the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> Ports Terminal and <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span>
Service has automatically been dissolved after the termination of its ten-year
existence provided for in the partnership disregarding the fact that, after the
termination of the ten-year period from January 1967, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Recentes</span> and de <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> and the
treasurer of the partnership never rendered an accounting for the purpose of
dissolving the partnership even up to the present, so that ordinarily the
partnership still continuously exists as usual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, defendants de <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Recentes</span> formed another partnership known as the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> Ports <span class="SpellE">Arrastre</span> and
Stevedoring Service and continued the business that was conducted by the former
partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is shown by the fact
that the last partnership is doing business with the clientele of the old
partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted also
that only plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>
was not included in the so-called new partnership.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">movant</span> failed to consider the
fact that while the existence of the former partnership may have been already
terminated, its existence as such partnership with respect to its members and
third-parties who may have interest therein, is not terminated until the
officers who are defendants in this case, and who were charged by law to make
the necessary accounting and liquidation for the purpose of terminating the
previous partnership shall <span class="GramE">comply</span> with the requisites
of the law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order dated <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="7">July 5,
 1974</st1:date> (Annex M), directed that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
management and operation of the partnership will remain with the officers of
said partnership and that Ramona Merced as receiver will only receive the net
profit of the partnership and to keep each income, account for them when
required by this court until such time as the same will be distributed to those
who may be entitled to it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1975</st1:date> (Annex O), reiterated the order dated <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1975</st1:date> (Annex Q), directed the defendants and Ramona Merced, the
receiver, to submit an accounting of the partnership affairs under pain of
contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">And the order of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">March
 31, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> (Annex S),
reiterated the previous orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The issue in this case is
simple:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Was there lack of jurisdiction
or grave <span class="GramE">abuse</span> of discretion in the issuance of the
questioned orders?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The answer is equally simple:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Art. 1829 of the Civil Code stipulates:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1829<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On</span> dissolution the partnership is not terminated, but continues
until the winding up of partnership affairs is completed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, all the questioned orders are intended to wind up <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the partnership affairs in an orderly manner
and to protect the interest of the plaintiff who is the private respondent in
this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge not only
had jurisdiction to issue the orders, he also acted prudently in the premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
