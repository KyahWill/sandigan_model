after the prosecution had </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">resented its first witness, accused Nunez
changed his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lea of "not guilty" to
"guilty." Hence, the lower court held, in abeyance the promulgation

Briones and Bonifacio Streets in Mandaue City.  Pfc. Tizon controlled the traffic </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Manatad manned the traffic; while Pfc. Catamora acted as back-up and posted
himself </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">at </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Norkis Trading building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">At about 4:00 o'clock in
the afternoon, Pfc. </span>Catamora noticed eight (8) persons, one of whom he
identified as Edwin Nunez, acting suspiciously.  He noticed one of them giving instructions to two of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">men to approach Pfc. Manatad.  He followed the two, but </span>sensing that
they were being followed, they immediately <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">proceeded to the middle of the road and engaged Pfc.</span> Catamora to
a gun battle.  At that instant, Pfc.
Catamora heard a series of shots from the other group and thereafter saw Pfc.
Manatad sprawled on the ground.  Being
out-numbered and to save his own life.  Pat. Catamora sought refuge at the nearby BIR Office from where he saw
two (2) persons take Pfc. Manatad's gun <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and
again fired at him to make sure that he is dead while the rest of the group
including Nuñez acted as </span>back up.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Thereafter, </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Nunez group commandeered a vehicle and fled </span>from
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the scene of the shooting.  Pfc. Rene Catamora testified that </span>he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">can identify accused?</span>appellant
Nunez because of a mole at the bridge of his nose near the left, eye which he
noticed when the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused passed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">2 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">or
3 meters in front of him together with his companions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On August 16, 1987, two
teams of police officers were tasked to conduct surveillance on a suspected
safehouse of members of the sparrow unit located in Peace Valley, Cebu
City.  Upon reaching the place, the
group saw </span>Rodrigo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Dasig </span>and
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Edwin Nuñez trying to e</span>scape.  The team of Capt. Antonio Gorre captured
Nuñez and confiscated a .45 caliber revolver with 3 magazines and ammunitions,
while the group of Sgt. Ronald Arnejo pursued Dasig, who threw a grenade at his
pursuers, but was shot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">his </span>left upper arm and
subsequently  apprehended.  A .38 caliber revolver with 17 live
ammunitions were confiscated from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Dasig was brought to the hospital for treatment,
while Nuñez was turned over to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">the </span>Metro
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">discom for investigation.  </span>Meanwhile, Dasig was interrogated by
M/Sgt. Ariston Ira of the PC Criminal Investigation Service on August 19, 1987
at his hospital bed at the Lapulapu Army Hospital in Cebu City.  Assisting Dasig during the interrogation was
Atty. Fortunato Parawan of the Creer Law Office, who was requested by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the military </span>to represent appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who </span>did not have a lawyer.  Before the start of the interrogation, Atty.
Parawan asked appellant whether he was willing to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">avail </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">his </span>services,
to which appellant agreed.  M/Sgt. Ira
then appraised Dasig of his constitutional rights.  The interrogation was conducted in Cebuano upon appellant's
request.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dasig confessed that he and the group of Edwin Nuñez killed Pfc.
Manatad.  He likewise admitted that he
and Nuñez were members of the sparrow unit and that their aliases were
"Armand" and "Mabi." respectively.  The extra-judicial confession of appellant
marked as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">Exhibit "J"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"> </span>was signed by him on every page
thereof with the first page containing a certification likewise signed by him,
which states: "I hereby certify that the herein statement is free and
voluntary, and that I am assisted by my counsel in the course of this
investigation" followed by the signed conformity of Atty. Parawan.  The extra-judicial confession was subscribed
and sworn to before Cebu City Asst. Fiscal Salvador Solima.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal, Dasig contends that the Procedure by which
his extra-judicial confession was taken was legally defective, and contrary to
his Constitutional rights.  He further
contends that assuming he conspired in the killing of Pfc. Manatad, he should
be convicted at most of simple rebellion and not murder with direct assault.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also claims <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">that
</span>the custodial interrogation was done while he was still very sick and
consequently, he could not have fully appreciated the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">wisdom of </span>admitting such a serious offense.  That even with the presence of counsel, his
extra-judicial confession is inadmissible in evidence as said counsel did not
actively assist <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">him </span>and advise
him of his rights.  In effect, his
presence was merely to give a semblance of legality to the proceedings and not
to protect appellant against possible abuses of the investigator.  Dasig, likewise questions the sincerity of
Atty. Parawan in protecting his rights considering that the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is </span>a known anti-Communist advocate and
that the law firm to which he belongs has represented high ranking officers of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the argument specious.  Fiscal Salvador Solima in his certification.  Exhibit "J-7-B," stated that he had personally examined
the affiant and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>is convinced that the latter's
statement was free and voluntary and that the affiant signed the same in his
presence and swore under oath as to the veracity of everything therein Atty.
Fortunato L. Parawan also testified that he assisted the affiant from the start
of the investigation up to its termination.  Atty. Parawan testified thus:</p>

introduced Rodrigo Dasig to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
inquired from the personnel of the hospital the whereabout of Rodrigo Dasig and
I introduced myself as a lawyer.   So
they informed me the room of Rodrigo Dasig.  At that time I introduced myself as a lawyer who came to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">assist </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
Ariston Ira conducted the investigation was Dasig informed of his
constitutional rights to remain silent, to counsel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">and if </span>he chooses to testify or say something, that statement of
his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">will be </span>used against or in
his favor in the court of justice?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.  He was willing to get me as counsel in that
investigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
he was informed of his constitutional rights what transpired next?</blockquote>

investigation started.</blockquote>

you present at the very start of that investigation?</blockquote>

finished.</blockquote>

that reduced to writing?</blockquote>

said you were present during the entire investigation.  Were the answers of the accused, Rodrigo

they are voluntary.</blockquote>

the investigation, I think that was already past 3:00 or 4:00, we proceeded to
the office of the City Fiscal at F. Ramos St., Cebu City and then we proceeded

Fiscal Solema (sic).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not find any reason to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">doubt </span>the factual findings and conclusions of the trial court
that the extra-judicial confession of the appellant was voluntarily made.  Said the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"The prosecution's evidence clearly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

independent counsel preferably of his own choice but since at that time he did
not </span>signify his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">intention to
retain a lawyer of his own choice, so he was provided with </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">lawyer in the person of Atty. Fortunato

during the custodial investigation conducted by T/Sgt. Ariston L. Ira at his
hospital </span>bed at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Camp Lapulapu
Army Station Hospital, Cebu City where he was confined after being hit on his

<blockquote>"Anent his claim that Atty. Fuentes was not his choice,
Section 12 (1) of Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Sec. 12(1).- Any person under investigation for the commission of
an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent
and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">own choice.  If the person cannot afford the services of counsel he must be provided
with one.  These rights cannot be waived
except in writing and in the presence of counsel.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">is </span>very
clear from the aforequoted provision that a person under investigation for the
commission of an offense may choose his own counsel but if he cannot afford the
services of counsel, he must be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">provided
</span>with one.   While the initial
choice of the lawyer in the latter case is naturally lodged in the police
investigators, the accused really has the final choice as he may reject the
counsel chosen for him and ask for another one.  In the instant case, the records show that no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">objection was voiced b</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">y </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the

<p class="BODY">Appellant relies on the much abused claim that his extra-judicial
confession was legally defective and hence, should not have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">admitted </span>and considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">by </span>the trial judge.  This accusation is whimsical and obviously a
mere refuge for appellant's turnabout.  In an attempt to avoid criminal liability, he now questions the
integrity of the police authorities and the reputation of the lawyer who stood
by him during the investigation.  Indubitably established and now a matter of record is the fact that
appellant was assisted by Atty. Parawan who even signed the former's sworn
declarations.  It is likewise a matter
of record that before appellant made his extra-judicial confession, he was
first asked if he was amenable to the services of Atty. Parawan to which query
he answered affirmatively.  Finally, the
alleged use of force and intimidation has not been substantiated by evidence
other than his self-serving testimony.  As has been pointed out, such allegation is another naive effort of
appellant to back track from his prior voluntary admission of guilt.  Evidently, the taking of his extra-judicial
confession was done with regularity and legality.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

point as manifested in the People's brief, which We quote:</p>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>government, among other<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> means.  (Article 135, Revised Penal Code).  In this case, appellant not only confessed voluntarily his membership

13.0pt">group in the killing of Pfc. Manatad while manning the traffic in

<p class="BODY">The crime of rebellion consists of many acts.  It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is
a vast </span>movement of men and a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">complex
net of </span>intrigues and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">plots.  Acts committed in furtherance of rebellion
though crimes in </span>themselves are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">deemed

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is a person in authority is a mere
component or ingredient of rebellion or an act done in furtherance of the
rebellion.  It cannot be made a basis of
a </span>separate charge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Moreover, in </span>the

We <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">held that where the accused who was </span>charged
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with murder admitted </span>his
membership with the NPA and the killing of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>suspected PC informer, the crime committed is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">murder </span>but rebeIlion punishable under
Articles 134 and 135 of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the proper imposable penalty, the Indeterminate Sentence
Law is not applicable to persons convicted of rebellion (Sec. 2 R.A. 4203),
contrary to the insinuation of the Solicitor General.  Article 135 of the Revised Penal Code imposes the penalty of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p</span>ri</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">sion mayor</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>and
a fine not exceeding P20,000.00 to any person who promotes, maintains, or heads
a rebellion.  However, in the case at
bar, there is no evidence to prove that appellant Dasig headed the crime
committed.  As a matter of fact he was
not specifically pinpointed by Pfc. Catamora as the person giving instructions
to the group which attacked Pfc. Manatad.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant merely participated in committing the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">act, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">or just </span>executed the command of an unknown leader.  Hence, he should be made to suffer the
penalty of imprisonment of eight (8) years of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">prision mayor</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.  </span>For the resulting death, appellant is
likewise ordered to pay the heirs of Pfc. Manatad FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS
(P50,000.00) as civil indemnity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Premises considered, We uphold the findings of the trial court
that the extra-judicial confession was legally obtained.  However, appellant being a confessed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">member of the sparrow unit, the liquidation
squad of </span>the New People's Army whose objective is to overthrow <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">the </span>duly constituted government, the
crime committed is simple rebellion and not murder with direct assault.</p>
