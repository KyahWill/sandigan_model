				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The main issue raised in this appeal is whether admissions
obtained during custodial interrogations without the benefit of Miranda
warnings and in the absence of counsel are admissible in evidence when the same
are later reduced into writing and signed in the presence of counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Carlos Tupaz filed this appeal from the decision of the
Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Metro Manila in Criminal Case No. 70857, finding
him and his co-accused, Eduardo de Jesus guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of Robbery with Homicide.  The
dispositive portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds the accused Ruel Capistrano NOT
GUILTY of the offense herein charged for insufficiency of evidence so that said
charge should be and is hereby DISMISSED as against him; and that the accused
Carlos Tupaz and Eduardo de Jesus are GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of Robbery with Homicide as charged and therefore hereby sentences each
of them to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>; and <i>in </i><i><span style="">solidum</span></i><span style="">, </span>to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Leonardo Garcia the sum
P30,000.00 and to restitute to Nelson Garcia, the brother of the victim, the
amount of P7,000.00 which he spent for the wake and funeral of his deceased
brother."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused were charged in an Amended Information which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 8th day of September, 1987, in the
Municipality of Pasig, Metro Manila, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above named accused, conspiring and confederating
together and all of them mutually helping and aiding one another, armed with a
dagger, a stainless knife and an icepick, with intent to gain, without the
knowledge and against the will of the owner thereof and by means of force and
intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take,
rob and divert from one Leonardo Garcia y Carian a tricycle driver, cash money
amounting to P40.00; that on the occasion of the said robbery and for the
purpose of insuring success in their criminal acts, the said accused with
intent to kill, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping and
aiding with one another, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously attack, assault and stab said Leonardo Garcia y Carian, thereby
causing the latter to sustain fatal stab wounds which directly caused his
death."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found from the records reveal that on September 8,
1987, at about 8:30 p.m., three unidentified men flagged down the tricycle of
Leonardo Garcia.  After a few minutes'
ride, Leonardo was stabbed 17 times on the neck, trunk and on the extremities,
causing his death.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
His meager earning that day of P40.00 was taken from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of Leonardo was referred to Pat. Rogelio Lorbes for
investigation after a certain Violeta de Vera reported to the Pasig Police
Station at around 11:00 p.m. on September 8, 1987 that a victim of robbery
hold-up was brought to Rizal Medical Center.  Pat. Lorbes, together with a Pat. Meoleta, went to the said hospital and
was informed that the victim's identity was Leonardo Garcia.  After gathering more information from the
victim's sister, Pat. Lorbes went immediately to the scene of the crime
specifically at San Agustin Street at the back of the Public Market, Pasig,
Metro Manila.  However, he failed to
gather any information on the commission of the crime or identities of the
assailants, since no one among those he interviewed witnessed the incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 9, 1987, Cpl. Arnaldo Limpoco and Pfc. Reynaldo
Zapata were dispatched to a particular stall along San Agustin St., Public
Market, Pasig to look for a certain “Eddie” and another surnamed Tupaz in
connection with the death of Leonardo.  Upon finding the two, the police officers asked them whether they had
knowledge of the stabbing incident, to which they <span style="">allegedly </span>answered <span style="">in </span>the
affirmative.  “Eddie,” accused Edgardo
de Jesus, then surrendered to the officers two bladed weapons:  one ten-inch dagger and one eleven-inch
stainless knife.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
“Eddie” and Tupaz, herein appellant Carlos Tupaz, were brought by the officers
to police headquarters, where they were turned over to Pat. Lorbes.  The two were then interrogated by Pat.
Lorbes<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
without the assistance of counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> On
September 10, 1987, Pat. Lorbes fetched a lawyer from CLAO, Atty. Oscar
Saldivar, and in the latter's presence, reduced the statements of the two
accused to writing.  Both accused signed
their respective statements.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant Carlos Tupaz had a different version
of his arrest.  He testified that he was
a market vendor and owns a stall at the Pasig Public Market selling pineapples,
cabbages, stringbeans, bananas and other fruits and vegetables.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He has been in this trade for four years and practically live, eat and sleep in
said stall.</p>

<p class="BODY">He claimed that in the morning of September 9, 1987, while he was
tending his stall at the Public Market in Pasig, three men in civilian clothes
entered his stall, poked a gun at him and begun searching the place.  After which, he was mauled and was forced to
board a jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> While inside the jeep, he
continued receiving blows until they reached the Police Headquarters <span style="">of Pasig.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the police headquarters, appellant was placed in one <span style="">of </span>the detention cells.  Around midnight, he was taken out of <span style="">his </span>cell by Cpl. Limpoco and brought to
a room where he was handcuffed and blindfolded by Cpl. Limpoco.  Cpl. Limpoco then began mauling him, all the
while forcing him to admit killing somebody at the market.  After three hours, appellant was returned to
his cell.  The following day, September
10, 1987, appellant asked to see a doctor, but was refused by the jail guard.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of that same day Pat. Lorbes
took him to the CLAO office to sign some documents (Exhibit “K”), with <span style="">a </span>warning and threat not to say
anything about the incident which transpired the night before.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant Tupaz denied knowing Eduardo de Jesus, or “Boy Negro” until he met
them in jail.  He also denied furnishing
the answers in his alleged statement,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
although he admitted that it was his signature which appeared thereon.  In fact, he never gave a statement to the
police that he was a<span style=""> </span>truck
helper, because he is not, as he is a vegetable and fruit vendor.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As observed by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>“After a thorough assessment of the evidence submitted in this
case, the Court is given the impression that the prosecution mainly relied on
the sworn statements in the nature of confessions given by both the accused
Carlos Tupaz and Eduardo de Jesus before the police investigator, Pfc. Rogelio
Lorbes, sometime in the morning of September 10, 1987; and their supplementary
sworn statements which may also be construed as confessions given before the
same investigator sometime on October 26, 1987, both of which identified the
other accused Ruel Capistrano upon the latter's arrest, as their companion when
they robbed and killed the victim Leonardo Garcia that night of September 8,
1987 somewhere at San Agustin Street, Volante, New Public Market, Pasig, Metro
Manila.”<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There being no other witness to the crime, the court itself relied
heavily on the sworn statements of the accused declaring that their
“interlocking confessions which were corroborated in some aspects by some other
evidence” leaves “<u><span style="">very little doubt</span></u><span style="">”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>(underscoring ours) that they were
responsible for the crime.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court further said:</p>

<blockquote>“The Court viewed with jaundiced eyes the protestations of Tupaz
and de Jesus when they testified that they did not know the contents of the
documents presented to them and were forcibly made to sign each one of them
because of physical maltreatment that they suffered in the hands of police
officers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“They could have blurted out to the fiscal that these statements
were extracted from them by force and intimidation and the fiscal could easily
order their detention elsewhere such as the provincial jail so that they maybe
beyond the clutches of their captors.  But they did not.  This is one
significant factor determinative of the falseness of their claim that they were
not aware of the contents of the documents executed by them and that their
signatures or thumbmarks were affixed thereon through force and threats.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While there is some merit in the above pronouncement of the trial
judge, but has the prosecution established the burden of evidence of proof
beyond reasonable doubt?  Is the alleged
extra-judicial confession admissible in evidence?  If so, is it sufficient to convict?</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <i>Morales v. Ponce Enrile</i><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court laid down the correct procedure for peace officers to <span style="">follow </span>when making an arrest and in conducting
a custodial <span style="">investigation:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“At the time a person is arrested, it shall be the duty of the
arresting officer to inform him of the reason for the arrest and he must be
shown the warrant of arrest, if any.  He
shall be informed of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to counsel,
and that any statement he might make could be used against him.  The person arrested shall have the right to
communicate with his lawyer, a relative, or anyone he chooses by the most
expedient means – by telephone if possible – or by letter or messenger.  It shall be the responsibility of the
arresting officer to see to it that this is accomplished.  No custodial investigation shall be conducted
unless it be in the presence of counsel engaged by the person <span style="">arrested, by any person on his behalf or
appointed by the court upon petition either of the detainee himself of by
anyone on his behalf.  The right to
counsel may be waived but the waiver shall not be valid unless made with the
assistance of counsel.  Any statement obtained
in violation of the procedure herein laid down, whether exculpatory or
inculpatory in whole </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">in part, shall be inadmissible in evidence.”</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this instant case, the investigating officer Pfc. Rogelio
Lorbes admitted that the two accused, Tupaz and de Jesus were turned over to
him for investigation on September 9, 1987 by the CID, interviewed them and
solicited from them facts and information surrounding the robbery hold-up with
homicide without the assistance of a lawyer.  The facts and information were later reduced to writing on September 10,
1987 in the presence of a CLAO lawyer, a certain Atty. Saldivar.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering such circumstances, there was an apparent violation of the accused
right to counsel.  The right to counsel
attaches upon the start of an investigation, <i>i.e.</i>, when the
investigating officer starts to ask questions to elicit information or
confession or admission from the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant in this case was already arrested as one of the principal
suspects in the killing of Garcia when he was turned over to Pfc. Lorbes for
investigation.  According to the
testimony of Cpl. Limpoco, he, together with his team, was ordered to make a
follow-up investigation of a stabbing incident that happened at the New Pasig
Public Market on or about September 8, 1987; and that their target persons were
one Eddie and another Tupaz.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the “interview” conducted by Pfc. Lorbes cannot be considered
merely as a general inquiry but rather a custodial investigation.  Custodial investigation is the stage where
the police investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime
but has began to focus on a particular suspect who had been taken into custody
by the police who carry out a process of interrogation that lends itself to
elicit incriminating statements.  It is
when questions are initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has
been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any
significant way.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the other constitutional pre-condition, particularly that
of the Miranda warning, the trial court was convinced that this was met in as
much as the sworn statements<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> show
that this was complied with.  We
disagree.  In the case of <i><span style="">People v. Jara,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court through Justice Gutierrez,
said:</p>

<blockquote>“[The] stereotyped ‘advice’ appearing in practically all
extrajudicial confessions which <span style="">are
later </span>repudiated has assumed the nature of ‘legal form’ or model.  Police investigators either automatically
type it together with the curt ‘Opo’ as the answer or ask the accused to sign
it or even copy it in their handwriting.  Its tired, punctilious, fixed and artificially stately style does not
create an impression of voluntariness or even understanding on the part of the
accused.  The showing of a spontaneous,
free and unconstrained giving up of <span style="">a </span>right
is missing.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is possible that the accused-appellant really took part in the
robbery hold-up, but the Court is not persuaded to the point of moral
certainty, which is the high standard of proof required for conviction.  If We disregard the extrajudicial
confession, We find that the prosecution has no other evidence to sustain a
finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">So often has it been said that it is better for one hundred criminals
to go free than for one innocent man to be convicted.  That is the reason why We require the constitutional presumption
of innocence to be offset only <span style="">by </span>most
persuasive of proofs that will establish the guilt of the accused beyond the
whisper of doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding that the guilt of the accused-appellant
Carlos Tupaz has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, the decision of the
lower court is hereby REVERSED and the accused-appellant is ACQUITTED.</p>
