				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a review of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court, Branch XIX in Bacoor, Cavite convicting appellant Guillermo Eglipa of Murder, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, foregoing considered, the Court finds accused Guillermo Eglipa GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder and there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances present in the commission of the crime hereby sentences said accused to suffer a penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i> to indemnify the offended party in the amount of P30,000.00, to pay actual damages of P37,827.30 as funeral expenses and moral damages of P10,000.00 and exemplary damages of P10,000.00 and to pay the cost. Accused is credited with his preventive imprisonment during his confinement in jail." (p. 337, <i>Rollo</i>)</blockquote>The records disclose, that appellant Eglipa and Rudy Valiente were jointly charges with Murder in an information filed in December, 1982 by the 3rd Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Cavite with the Regional Trial Court of Cavite at Bacoor for the killing of Ricardo Gardeleza, a Minister of the Iglesia ni Kristo, that occurred in Barrio Talaba, Bacoor, Cavite, on August 16, 1982. Rudy Valiente was later released in due course after his acquittal by the Decision of the trial court dated January 21, 1987. (p. 343, <i>Rollo</i>)<br><br>The prosecution relied on Gerson Samson to prove the involvement of appellant but the trial court did not give credence to his due to inconsistencies in his testimony. However, the trial court convicted appellant on the basis of his two separate extra-judicial confessions made on April 17, 1982 at the Bacoor Police Station and on September 10, 1982 at the Criminal Investigation Service, Camp Crame, Quezon City. Hence this recourse where the sole issue raised by appellant is the admissibility of his two extra-judicial confessions.<br><br>The trial court noted that the extra-judicial confessions of Eglipa were taken without the presence of counsel. But despite the doctrine laid down in <i>Morales vs. Ponce Enrile,</i> 121 SCRA 538 and <i>People vs. Galit,</i> G.R. No. L-51770, March 20, 1985 viz: <i>"No custodial investigation shall be conducted unless it be in the presence of counsel engaged by the person arrested, by any person on his behalf, or appointed by the court upon petition either of the detainee himself or by anyone on his behalf the right to counsel may be waived but the waiver shall not be valid unless made with the assistance of counsel. Any statement obtained in violation of the procedure herein laid down, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, in whole or in part, shall be inadmissible in evidence."</i> Such requirements were merely considered as "governing guidelines" in future cases. (p. 326, Rollo). Also, it considered the Confessions executed on August 17, 1982 and September 9, 1982 admissible in view of the fact that they were made before April 26, 1983, the date <i>Morales vs. Ponce Enrile</i> was promulgated. In other cases, however, where this court was confronted with the same issue of the admissibility of extra-judicial confessions executed earlier than April 26, 1983, this Court declared the extra-judicial confessions inadmissible.<br><br>In addition, appellant was able to prove that he was compelled under duress and force to execute the extra-judicial confession on August 17, 1982, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" valign="top">"Atty.
