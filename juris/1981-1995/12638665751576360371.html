				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issues upon which this dispute turns are neither novel nor of
any great complexity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case is
notable chiefly for the careless and slipshod manner in which it was dealt with
by officials of the defunct Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flawed with error from the outset, it had
initially been filed with the Workmen's Compensation Unit at <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> as a
claim for disability benefits <span style="">for <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>, a driver
of <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> Transit, <span style="">who </span>had allegedly become incapacitated from a brain tumor
contracted in the course of his employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was very shortly discovered, however, that <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>
was already dead and hence, the claim should not have been filed in his
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was replaced with one for
death benefits, this <span style="">time in the name of
<span class="SpellE">Padernal's</span> widow, Lourdes Dice <span class="SpellE">Ouinto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>, for
herself and in behalf of her minor children.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An award was rendered <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
about a year later, on <st1:date year="1974" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1974</st1:date>,
by the Acting Chief of the WCC Unit, in favor of Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the award was patently erroneous; for it
found that Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> (not her husband, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>) had contracted a brain tumor while in the employ of <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> Transit, which illness was either <span style="">aggravated by or the result of the nature of
her employment, </span>and on <span style="">this ludicrously
erroneous foundation, </span>ordered <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> to pay
Lourdes herself P623.25 as <span style="">reimbursement
for medical expenses and P6,000.00 as compensation for permanent total
disability.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notice of the award was served on <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span>
Transit which immediately filed a motion praying for reinstatement of its right
to controvert the claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alleging that
it had never received notice, either of the filing of the claim or of the
proceedings in the WCC, or even of the illness of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> asserted that it had thus been denied an
opportunity to controvert the claim and to show, not only that Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> had never been its employee, but also, and even if
the award be read to refer<span style=""> to <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>, that there was </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">causal connection between his illness and the nature of his work, not
to mention the fact that when <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> died, he had
already long ceased to be an employee of <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span>
Transit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to reinstate was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a subsequent motion for reconsideration
was pronounced well-taken,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
although instead of giving <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> <span style="">a </span>chance to offer proof against the cl<span style="">a</span>im, the same Acting Chief of the WCC
Unit forthwith issued an amended award, this time finding that <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> had developed a
brain tumor "which was either aggravated by or the result of the nature of
his employment while in the employ of respondent as driver (and) resulting to
(sic) his/her death on February 4, 1972," and on that basis sentencing <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> to pay his widow P5,383.36 as death compensation
and reimbursement for <span style="">burial expenses,
P623.35 as reimbursement of medical expenses, and P250.20 as attorney's fees.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> appealed to the Commission, but
there it lost again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, the
Commission did rule that the amended award of death benefits was
"erroneous," "fatally defective" and "devoid of
merit," since <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> had died more than two
years after the date of disability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless the Commission awarded disability benefits for <span class="SpellE">Padernal's</span> "total" and "permanent"
incapacity predicated on what it declared to be the "indisputable
fact" that the <span style="">latter had been
"employed as a driver by respondent and * * during the course of his
employment * * developed the ailment later on diagnosed as a brain tumor which
disabled him totally for labor on November 1, 1969 and caused his death on
February 4, 1972."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission brushed aside the issue <span style="">of </span>lack of notice raised by <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span>; it
adverted to the fact that a registry return card had been received by the WCC
Unit relative to the notice sent by the Hearing Officer to <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span>,
and to the decision in <span class="SpellE"><u>Vda</u></span><u>. de <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> vs. WCC</u><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
awarding similar benefits despite the failure to give the notice or to file the
claim required by Section 24 of the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lecaroz</span></span><span style=""> filed a motion for reconsideration, which
the Commission denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the preset
appeal:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) pleading lack of notice of,
variously, the sickness or death of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>, the filing of the claim for benefits, and the
proceedings conducted in the WCC Unit at San Pablo City up to the time of the
original award; and (b) asserting an ability, given the opportunity, to show
that (1) <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> had
ceased to be employed by <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> as early as in 1957,
(2) at the time he left such employ, he was completely free from any ailment
that might have been caused or aggravated by the nature of work and (3) his
alleged brain tumor had been contracted many years after his separation from <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz's</span> service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Present <span style="">&nbsp; </span>respondents were
directed by the Court to comment on the petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>
never complied, despite notice which was effected only with no <span style="">little difficulty, and a subsequent
show-cause resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The comment filed
by the Secretary of Labor stressed, mainly, <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz's</span>
forfeiture of its right to controvert the claim, resulting in its being barred
from setting up the so-called non-jurisdictional defenses, such as that the
illness did not arise out and in the course of employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Due process requires, of course, that before any person is made
liable to perform any <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> or satisfy any
liability, there be prior notice and opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In workmen's compensation cases under the old
law, <span style="">Act No. 3428, it was necessary, in
addition, that notice </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the illness of injury be given the employer
and the claim based thereon filed within specific periods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That notice was a condition precedent to the
prosecution </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">any claim for compensation; a failure to give
it barred recovery.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Section 24 of the Act provided:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
compensation proceeding under this Act shall prosper unless the employer has
been given notice <span style="">of </span>the injury
or sickness as soon as possible after the same was received or contracted and
unless a claim for compensation <span style="">wa</span>s<span style=""> </span>made not later than two months after the
date of the injury or sickness, or in case of death, not later than three
months after death, regardless of whether or not compensation was claimed by
the employee himself. * * *.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The notice requirement has been liberally interpreted, both in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
upon whose statutes our compensation law had been <span class="SpellE">modelled</span>,
and in this jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be
given in any form, even orally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
the Act provided that "failure or delay in giving notice * * (was not) a
bar to the proceeding if it is shown <span style="">that
the employer, his agent or representative had knowledge of the accident or that
the employer did not suffer by such delay </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">failure."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Even so, notice in some
form or other was generally deemed imperative, the need for it being founded on
the employer's correlative duty himself to notify the Workmen's Compensation
Commission of t<span style="">he </span>employee's
sickness or injury and to manifest whether he (the employer) was admitting <span style="">or denying liability for compensation, such
notification </span>being, <span style="">in turn,
requisite to the preservation of his right to controvert the claim.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As already observed, <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> flatly
denies receiving any notice, and on that account having any knowledge, of the
alleged illness of <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> or of the compensation
claim filed on behalf of the latter or<span style=""> </span>of
the proceedings conducted thereon prior to being served copy of original award
of July 22, 1974 erroneously rendered in favor of Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the only evidence
contradicting this disclaimer consists of:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) the testimony of the same Feliciano Reyes who had originally filed the
claim on behalf of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span>
that such notice had <u>orally</u> been given,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) a registry return receipt purporting to show that notice of the claim
had also been dispatched to <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> <span style="">by </span>the San Pablo WCC Unit on March 7,
1974<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> which,
however, carries an illegible and never-identified signature where that of the
addressee or his agent should appear <span style="">in </span>acknowledgment
of its <span style="">receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These "proofs" are quite clearly
too weak and ambiguous in character to survive the direct challenge offered by <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span>, given the fact that notice, as already pointed
out, is as crucial to the claimant's cause as it is to the respondent's in a
compensation case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, given the <u>prima facie</u> serious and substantial
objections it has raised against the compensation claim, the Court cannot bring
itself to believe that <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span>, if it had had notice
thereof, would have passively allowed the proceedings <span style="">before the San Pablo WCC Unit to progress, as they did, to an award
without even making an appearance therein; this, as much as any other
consideration, inclines to the belief that no such notice was in fact
effectively given and received.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Calado</span></u></span><u><span style=""> </span>vs. </u><u><span style="">WCC</span></u><span style="">, </span><u>supra</u>,
cannot appropriately be cited to support the respondents here because it does
not dispense with the requirement of notice or the filing of a formal claim
unqualifiedly and under all circumstances, but simply <span style="">applies </span><span style="">and gives effect
to the earlier-quoted Section 27 of the Workmen's Compensation Act that failure
</span><span style="">or </span><span style="">delay </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">giving notice does not bar a claim if it is
shown that the employer, </span>his <span style="">agent
or representative had knowledge of the accident or that the employer did not
suffer by such delay </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">failure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There the Court found that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“* * (t)here <span style="">is </span>no
controversy that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Calado</span> was employed with <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span>, that he contracted tuberculosis that arose out of
and in the course <span style="">of </span>such
employment and that he eventua<span style="">lly</span>
died of said illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there
any question that petitioners were his dependents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That tuberculosis is a compensable sickness
is expressly recognized in Section 2 of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> does not and
cannot dispute the fact that from the first time <span class="SpellE">Calado</span>
<span class="SpellE">vomitted</span> blood and exhibited other symptoms of the
disease, he repaired to the Company hospital and was treated thereat; that he
was not cured; when he left the hospital, the company physician refused to
issue to him any release paper allowing him to work; he <span style="">asked </span>for a sick leave, <span class="SpellE">Acoje</span> denied;
instead, he was made to sign resignation papers; scarcely over two years
thereafter, he died of the same malady.**.”<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As may be seen, the factual situation here is entirely different,
it never having been pretended that apart from the alleged notices that <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> firmly denies receiving, <span style="">said employer </span>or <span style="">its
agents or representatives had any actual knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Padernal's</span> ailment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appealed decision, while appearing to uphold <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz's</span> claim of an unimpaired right to controvert,
nonetheless denies said employer the appropriate relief, which should have been
the reception of such evidence that the latter had to offer to defeat the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it <span style="">also </span><span style="">summarily makes another award of disability benefit based on the
allegedly indisputable facts of <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> <span class="SpellE">Padernal's</span> employment as a driver by <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span>
and of his having, </span><span style="">in t</span><span style="">he course of </span><span style="">such </span><span style="">employment,
developed the illness which disabled him totally and later caused his death,
and holding, on the basis of <span class="SpellE"><u>Calado</u></span>, that <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> was not exempted from liability even if <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> had not been able to file claim while he was still
alive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not support those factual findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it is conspicuous for the
absence of any competent, credible evidence that <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> was in the employ of <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span>
at a time reasonably proximate to the <span style="">onset
of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz's</span>
vigorous assertions that <span class="SpellE">Padernal</span> had left its
service in the best of health as early as in 1957, or twelve (12) years before
he fell ill in 1969, some substantial proof that he remained so</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">employed
during that intervening period should have been offered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of compensability created by
law and jurisprudence does not arise from the failure alone of the alleged
employer to controvert a claim for compensation benefits; another essential, if
implicit, prerequisite is that the fact of employer-employee relationship and <span class="SpellE">supervention</span> of the illness during the existence of that
relation are established, the burden of doing so being upon the claimant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE, </b>being in error for awarding disability benefit
without clear evidentiary basis, as well for denying petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lecaroz</span> the opportunity to controvert the private
respondent's claim, the questioned decision of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission and the order of the respondent Secretary of Labor affirming said
decision are REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the proceedings wherein the same were
entered are DISMISSED, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>
