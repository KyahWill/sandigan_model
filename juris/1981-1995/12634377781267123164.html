				<BR><STRONG>NARVASA, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case chronicles the harrowing experiences of a young girl,
barely 14, at the hands of a member of the same household; twice snatched from
sleep in the dead of night, her will to resist sapped by being made to smoke
marijuana at knife-point, twice forced to submit in silence to that which her
sex would consider the ultimate invasion -- rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is called upon to review the conviction of the accused
on two informations filed before the trial court, ordering Edgardo Manuel y
Galang to suffer <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style=""> </span>and pay the victim the amounts of
P40,000.00 as indemnity and P10,000.00 as moral damages for each rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Emma Ruth Rabago was 13 years and eleven months old when the
alleged rapes occurred in 1989.  She
shared residence at 1163 Kagitingan Street, Tondo, Manila, with her sisters
(Estela and Anne Marie Garcia), cousins (Jeffrey Manlili, Josephine Rabago) and
niece (Jaja Manuel), as well as with Edgardo Manuel, the accused, and his
mother Lucy Manuel.  Emma's mother, Lucy
Paclibar Rabago was then working in Saipan.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first information alleges --</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 21st day of July, 1989, in the City of
Manila, Philippines, the said accused did then and there wilfully, unlawfully,
and feloniously with lewd designs, have carnal knowledge with (sic) the
undersigned complainant, a minor, 14 years of age, by then and there forcing
her to smoke marijuana, thereby making her dizzy, weak and unable to resist,
undressing her, threatening to kill her, lying on top of her and inserting his
penis into her private parts, then succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her,
against her will and consent."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A second information, alleging substantially the same facts,
averred that the complainant was also raped on the 23d of June, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty to both charges.  Upon order of the trial court, the cases
were consolidated and tried jointly.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution built its case primarily on the testimony of the
complainant.  Emma Rabago testified that
on the night of June 23, 1989, while sleeping in her unlit room with her sister
Estela P. Garcia, Edgardo entered, smoking a marijuana cigarette, <span style="">holding a </span><i><span style="">balisong</span></i><span style="">.  </span><span style="">He
tapped her on the shoulder, pointed the </span><i><span style="">balisong</span></i><span style=""> at </span><span style="">her neck and threatened to kill </span>her if
she would shout.  Emma did not shout,
fearing for her safety.  She smoked the
marijuana as ordered.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Edgardo, while keeping the weapon levelled at her neck, then carried her to the
floor and removed her clothing.  He lay
on top of her, inserted his penis in her vagina several times.  She felt pain, but did not struggle or
resist because she was very weak.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Emma testified that she reported the incident to two neighbors, a
certain Auntie Nitz, friend of her mother, and one Linda Borillo, another
neighbor, but nothing came of the reports.  She did not tell anyone else of the rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">She narrated the events that led to the second rape on July 21,
1989, stating that it took place at around 1:00 o'clock in the morning, while
sleeping with Estella Garcia on the same bed.  Emma claims that she woke up on the floor, apparently having been
carried there by Edgardo, who again made her smoke marijuana <span style="">while pointing a </span><i><span style="">balisong</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">at her neck.  When </span>the drug had taken effect on
Emma, Edgardo removed her clothes, lay on top of her and inserted his penis
into her vagina.  She again felt pain,
unable to offer any struggle against Edgardo, however, as she was overcome by
weakness.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This time, she reported the incident again to her Ate Linda, then
to the police on Aug. 13, 1989, with the assistance of her mother, who had
returned from Saipan.  On
cross-examination, Emma stated that she also reported the rapes to her father
and brother, who did nothing.  The
latter advised her, however, to wait for her mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">Adoracion Paclibar-Rabago, mother of Emma, testified that she
entrusted her children, Emma, Anne Marie Garcia and Estella Garcia, to Lucy
Manuel, mother of Edgardo.  It was,
however, Linda Borillo, her friend, who called overseas and told her to come
home as her daughter had been raped.  She returned to the Philippines on Aug. 10, 1989.  The next day, she had Emma examined at the
NBI by medico-legal officer, Dr. Noel B. Minay, who prepared a report which
indicates the presence of a "healed hymenal laceration."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was also learned at the trial that Edgardo was the defendant
in another case for acts of lasciviousness allegedly committed on Anne Marie
Garcia by touching her private parts.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the defense, on the other hand, consists mainly
of denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Edgardo testified that on the night of June 23, 1989, he was
sleeping in the sala of the house of Adoracion Paclibar.  He denied forcing Emma Ruth to smoke
marijuana and claimed he could not have raped her on either of the alleged
dates since three other persons slept in the room -- Anne Marie Garcia, Anthony
Rabago and Estella Garcia.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> Nor
could he have carried Emma to the floor because that is where Anthony
slept.  He claimed that it was Anthony
Rabago smoking marijuana, not he.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pressed for a reason for the filing of criminal cases against
him, Edgardo asserted that it was instigated by a certain Linda Hernandez
(godmother of Emma<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>) who
became envious when Adoracion entrusted her children to his mother, Lucy
Manuel.  He claims Linda was angered
when his mother refused to lend her money, so she convinced the children to
create a scandal that would drive him and his mother out of the house.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Edgardo also said that he was confronted about the reported rape
of Emma by Adoracion Paclibar when she returned from Saipan.  He refused to marry her, as demanded by
Adoracion, because he was "not in love with Emma Ruth Rabago and * * the
family is very troublesome," the daughters having different fathers.  He was surprised when policemen arrived to
arrest him, thinking that Adoracion was only joking when she said she would
file charges against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented Danilo Forte, who testified that he saw
Adoracion Paclibar, the mother of the complainant, having a beer with one
Leandro Ibarra at the store of Aling Virgie.  Forte testified that Adoracion said to the two persons she was speaking
with:  "You witnessed, even if a
person is innocent, I was able to have him incarcerated."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The statement, Forte claims, was made in the presence of many persons, and
clearly in reference to the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, through Assisting Judge Willelmo C. Fortun,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
promulgated its decision on April 29, 1992, the dispositive portion of which
reads as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Edgardo Manuel y
Galang <u>guilty</u> beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of "Rape"
charged in Crim. Cases No. 89-76010 and 89-76011, and pursuant to Article 335
of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, hereby sentences him as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1)  In Crim. Case No. 89-76010, accused is
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, to indemnify
Emma Ruth P. Rabago in the amount of P40,000.00, plus P10,000.00, as moral
damages, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the
costs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)  In Crim. Case No. 89-76011, accused is
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, to
indemnify Emma Ruth P. Rabago in the amount of P40,000.00, plus P10,000.00, as
moral damages without subsidiary imprisonment in the case of insolvency, and to
pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused assigns the following errors to the trial
court, <i>viz</i>.:  (1) finding the
accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of rape charged in Crim.
Case Nos. 89-76010 and 89-76011; (2) sentencing the accused to the penalty of <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style=""> </span>for each case; (3) ordering the
accused to indemnify the private complainant in the amount of P40,000.00 plus
P10,000.00 as moral damages in each case, and; (4) not giving "due
course" to (<i>i.e</i>., ignoring) the inconsistencies between the sworn
statement of the complainant before the police and her testimony before the
trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it must be pointed out that the medical
certificate allegedly issued following the medical examination of the private
complainant is not reliable evidence as to the fact of rape.  The document appears to have been prepared
by Noel B. Minay, M.D., of the<span style="">­ </span>Medico-Legal
Division of the NBI, the examining physician.  He was, however, out of the country during the trial.  The prosecution attempted, nonetheless, to
introduce the certificate in evidence against the accused by presenting Dr.
Nieto M. Salvador,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
whose competence was limited to identifying the signatures of his colleagues
which appeared on the document.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> The
medical certificate of Dr. Minay as to the condition of the complainant's
genitalia must be regarded as hearsay, the accused never having had the
opportunity to confront and cross-examine him.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Evidence of this nature deserves, as it possesses, no credibility
whatever.  It cannot, therefore,
establish any fact as to the condition of the genitalia of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Essentially, therefore, the Court is called upon to resolve the
conflicting claims of the complainant and the accused.  Reference to well-settled jurisprudence of
this Court removes the difficulty of this task.  As against the positive identification by the private
complainant, mere denials of accused cannot prevail to overcome conviction by
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would persuade the Court that inconsistencies in the
statements of the private complainant suffice to destroy her credibility,
questioning her claim of having reported the rapes to several persons.  He rejects the possibility of consummating
sexual congress in a room where other persons were sleeping.  Moreover, he attempts to impute ill-motive
to the complainant and other persons for filing of these charges against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">These protestations are unavailing and discussed forthwith, <i><span style="">seriatim</span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court had occasion to note the difficulty that young girls
have in coming forward to denounce an unwelcome sexual assault:</p>

<blockquote>"One should not expect a fourteen-year old girl to act like an
adult or mature and experienced woman who would know what to do under such
difficult circumstances and who would have the courage and intelligence to
disregard a threat on her life * * and complain immediately that she had been
forcibly deflowered.  It is not uncommon
for young girls to conceal for some time the assaults on their virtue because
of the rapist's threat on their lives, more so when the rapist is * * living
with her."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court is similarly not convinced that the discrepancies
between complainant's testimony in court and what she deposed in the affidavit
she signed at the police station on August 13, 1989 destroy her credibility.</p>

<blockquote>"The general rule has always been that discrepancies between
the statements of the affiant in his affidavit and those made by him on the
witness stand do not necessarily discredit him since <i><span style="">ex parte</span></i><span style=""> </span>affidavits
are generally incomplete.  Affidavits
are generally subordinated in importance to open Court declarations because
they are oftentimes executed when an affiant's mental faculties are not in such
a state as to afford him a fair opportunity of narrating in full the incident
which has transpired.  Further, affidavits
are not complete reproductions of what the declarant has in mind because they
are generally prepared by the administering officer and the affiant simply
signs them after the same have been read to them."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact is that Emma did report the matter to her mother
immediately upon the latter's arrival from Saipan, and this after earlier
confiding in Linda Borillo, who had called her mother overseas.  It is entirely natural and in accord with
ordinary experience that a girl of her tender years would need the presence and
support of her parent to go through the ordeal of a physical examination,
reporting to the police and testifying against her rapist in open court.  The Court has reviewed the testimony of Emma
and finds the same to be forthright and unwavering, and her identification of
the accused positive and certain.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the Court impressed by the claim that the charges against
the accused were filed by complainant because Edgardo refused to marry
her.  On the contrary, it seems more in
accord with reality that the offer to marry Emma was a result of the reported
rape, intended to spare her from the dishonor of Edgardo's uninvited lust.  Surely, no mother would prod her own
daughter to expose herself to humiliation and public curiosity for no good
reason.  Nor could it be expected that Emma
would, on her own, venture into the embarrassment of a rape investigation and
trial on trumped-up charges, given the Filipino woman's well-known modesty and
reticence.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused attempts exculpation on the theory that the presence of
other persons in the room renderred it impossible to commit the alleged <span style="">rapes.  </span>He maintained that it was not possible to carry Emma on the
floor, since that is where her brother Anthony slept, in such a way as to
obstruct ingress to or egress from the room.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has ruled repeatedly that the crime of rape may be
committed even when rapist and victim are not alone.  Rape may take only a short time to consummate, given the anxiety
of discovery, especially when committed near sleeping persons oblivious to the
goings-on.  Thus, the Court has held
that rape is not impossible even if committed in the same room while the
rapist's spouse was sleeping,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>or in a small room where other family
members also slept.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant questions the imposition of separate penalties
for each of the offenses charged.  He
forwards, however, no ground to show any infirmity in the judgment.  Suffice it to say that the appealed judgment
correctly, and in accordance with law, penalizes the accused for what the
evidence established to be two (2) separate and independent offenses of rape.</p>
