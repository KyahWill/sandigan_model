<blockquote>"That on November 27, 1973, at about 2:30 p.m. plaintiffs were
riding in their Mercury car, with Plate No. 44-43 (H-Manila-73), owned by
plaintiff Laura Velasco, and driven by their driver <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span>

Boulevard near the corner of Speaker Perez Street, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, toward the direction of Manila, when, before reaching said corner, an N/S
taxicab driven by defendant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Santos and with
Plate No. 75-25L (TX-QC-73), registered in the name of defendants Alice <span class="SpellE">Artuz</span>, c/o Norberto <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Santos,
crossed the center island towards their direction, and finally collided with
their car at the left front part, and thereafter, the said taxicab tried to
return to its original lane, but was unable to climb the island, and instead,
backtracked, hitting again plaintiffs' car in the left rear portion, causing
the latter's back portion to turn toward the center hitting a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> on its right, which was <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>
along their side going toward Manila also;"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

insured against third party liability for P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>

<p class="BODY">In its answer to the amended complaint, respondent <span class="SpellE">Maharlika</span> Insurance Co., Inc. claimed that there was no
cause of action against it because at the time of the accident, the alleged
insurance policy was not in force due to non-payment of the premium
thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It further averred that even if
the taxicab had been insured, the complaint would still be premature since the
policy provides that the insurer would be liable only when the insured becomes
legally liable.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">From the decision of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, petitioners elevated the case to this Court by a

respondent judge for considering private respondent's defense of late payment

payment should be disregarded supposedly because, as We understand petitioners'
argument, private respondent had thereby admitted that such fact was not in
issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They theorize that what was
stipulated in the pre-trial order "does not include the issue on whether
defendant <span class="SpellE">Maharlika</span> Insurance. Co., Inc. is liable
under the insurance policy, even as the premium was paid after </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

negligent.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioners’ position is
bereft of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have carefully

13.0pt">is no express statement as to the fact of late payment, this is
necessarily deemed included in or ineluctably inferred from the issue of
whether the company is liable under the insurance policy it had allegedly
issued for the vehicle Involved and on which petitioners seek to recover.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A pre-trial order is not meant to be a
detailed catalogue of each and every issue that is to be or may be taken up
during the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Issues that are
impliedly included therein or may be inferable <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>

those that are expressly stipulated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In fact, it would be
absurd and inexplicable for the respondent company to knowingly disregard or
deliberately abandon the issue of non-payment of the premium on the policy
considering that it is the very core of its defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Correspondingly, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot but perceive here an undesirable</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

to evade an issue determinative of a defense duly averred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Noteworthy, too is
petitioners' vacillation on this particular score.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their reply to respondents' comment,
petitioners categorically stated that respondents' point regarding the lack of
objection to the evidence is well taken, hence they do not insist on this
ground to review respondent court's decision.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

consider that matter as duly disposed of by the preceding discussion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintain that in spite of this late payment, the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We see no cogent proof of
any such implied agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
purported nexus between the delivery of the policy and the grant of credit
extension is too tenuous to support the conclusion for which petitioners
contend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The delivery of the policy was
made on March 28, 1974 and only because the premium had been paid, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

already happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there is
authority to hold that under such circumstances notice alone is necessary and

simple reason that no such contract existed between<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
