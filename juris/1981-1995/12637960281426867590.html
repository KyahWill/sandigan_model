<p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> to annul the order dated <st1:date month="10" day="25" year="1979">October 25, 1979</st1:date> of the former Deputy 
Minister of Labor in Case No. <span class="GramE">ROXI-C-209-79 and Case 
No.</span> LR-30-79, which affirmed the order dated May 31, 1979 of the Regional 
Director, granting the application of private respondent Mercantile Corporation 
of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> (MERCO), for clearance to terminate 
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Soco</span> 
and dismissing the latter's complaint for unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="BODY">Private respondent is engaged in the sale and distribution of ice 
cream in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Petitioner</span> who was employed as driver of <span class="SpellE">MERCO's</span> delivery van, was the President of the MERCO 
Employees Labor Union (MELU), an affiliate of the Federation of Free Workers 
(FFW).<span>&nbsp; </span>In the last week of January, 1979, the personnel officer of 
private respondent conducted an investigation due to reports that petitioner was 
carrying on his union (MELU) activities during his working hours for the purpose 
of transferring his Union's affiliation <span>from the FFW to the Southern 
Philippines Federation of Labor (SPFL) and for this purpose he was even 
utilizing the company vehicle of MERCO, in violation of the </span>Company's 
Rule No. 19(a) which prescribes a penalty of suspension of 15 days for the first 
offense and dismissal for succeeding offenses.</p>
<p class="BODY">It appears that on January 25, 1979, petitioner was ordered to 
deliver ice cream to the Imperial Hotel and <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span> Hotel at C.M. Recto Avenue and to Your Goody 
Mart at <span class="SpellE">Anda</span> Street, all in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, but he deviated from the usual route and went to 
Kiosk No. <span>4 on San Pedro Street to talk to <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Calago</span>, a co-employee, 
but who was then off-duty.<span>&nbsp; </span>The personnel officer of MERCO advised 
petitioner to report to his office to explain his unauthorized deviation in 
connection with said incident but petitioner did not comply.<span>&nbsp; </span>On 
</span><st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1979"><span>January 30, 
1979</span></st1:date><span>, MERCO wrote the FFW to which MELU </span>was 
affiliated and wherein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Soco</span> was the President asking for a grievance conference to 
be scheduled not later than <st1:date month="2" day="13" year="1979">February 
13, 1979</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>When petitioner manifested his unwillingness 
to attend the grievance conference in his belief that such is not necessary, FFW 
relayed this information to MERCO.<span>&nbsp; </span>Due to the refusal of 
petitioner to submit <span class="GramE">himself</span> to a formal conference, 
MERCO, in a memorandum dated <st1:date month="2" day="13" year="1979">February 
13, 1979</st1:date> suspended petitioner for five (5) days, effective <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1979">February 15, 1979</st1:date>, for violation of 
<span>Company Rule No. 19(a).<span>&nbsp; </span>Then a report of this action taken 
was filed with the Ministry of Labor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="13" year="1979">February 13, 
1979</st1:date>, at <st1:time hour="10" minute="30">10:30 A.M.</st1:time>, 
petitioner was instructed to deliver ice cream to the <span>New </span>City 
Commercial Corporation <span>at </span><st1:street><st1:address>R. <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> and <span class="SpellE">Gempesaw</span> Store at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Gempesaw</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:city></st1:address> City.<span>&nbsp; </span>After 
making these deliveries, petitioner then proceeded to the Office of SPEL Union 
at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Puericulture</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> building located on 
<st1:street><st1:address>Alvarez Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>John <span class="SpellE">Ferrazzini</span>, Manager of MERCO saw the 
company vehicle parked along the street.<span>&nbsp; </span>After verifying that 
petitioner was the driver of the MERCO Ford <span class="SpellE">Fierra</span> 
van, he then called for Rogelio <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Galagar</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> Secretary of the 
MELU and another employee and in their presence, the MERCO manager took out the 
rotor of the van.<span>&nbsp; </span>Later that morning, when petitioner came out of 
the building he was unable to start the engine of the vehicle and he called for 
company assistance.<span>&nbsp; </span>An officer of MERCO advised herein petitioner 
to report to his office because of the said incident in order to explain his 
unauthorized deviation but petitioner did not do so.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="2" day="14" year="1979">February 14, 1979</st1:date>, respondent MERCO 
wrote the FFW to which MELU was affiliated <span>and the </span>petitioner 
herein was the President, <span>for </span>a grievance conference on <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1979">February 15, 1979</st1:date>, but this was reset 
to <st1:date month="2" day="21" year="1979">February 21, 1979</st1:date> to 
afford <span>FFW </span>sufficient time to notify petitioner <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Soco</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span>On </span><st1:date month="2" day="20" year="1979">February 20, 
1979</st1:date>, FFW informed MERCO that the requested grievance conference 
would not be held because petitioner <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Soco</span> finds it unnecessary to do so.</p>
<p class="BODY">On his part, petitioner filed on <st1:date month="2" day="14" year="1979">February 14, 1979</st1:date> a complaint for unfair labor practice 
against MERCO, docketed by the Regional Office of the Ministry of Labor, 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, as LRD Case No. <span class="GramE">LR-30-79.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner alleged therein that the 
five (5) days suspension imposed on him by respondent Company, was on account of 
his union activities.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="21" year="1979">February 21, 
1979</st1:date>, petitioner was placed on preventive suspension pending the 
approval of <span class="SpellE">MERCO's</span> appli<span>cation for clearance to 
terminate the services of the </span>former.<span>&nbsp; </span>This application was 
filed with the Ministry of Labor on <st1:date month="2" day="22" year="1979">February 22, 1979</st1:date> and docketed therein as LRD Case No. 
<span class="GramE">ROXI-C-209-79.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">MERCO's</span> application for clearance to terminate was opposed 
by petitioner even as MERCO filed its Answer to the complaint against it for 
unfair labor practice, on <st1:date month="3" day="7" year="1979">March 7, 
1979</st1:date>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The two cases were consolidated and tried jointly as agreed to by 
the contending parties.<span>&nbsp; </span>In an order dated <st1:date month="5" day="21" year="1979">May 21, 1979</st1:date>, the Regional Director granted 
private respondent's application to terminate the employment of 
petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>He upheld the preventive suspension imposed by MERCO 
on herein petitioner and dismissed the latter's complaint for unfair labor 
practice.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said order was then appealed by herein petitioner but 
the Deputy Minister <span>of Labor, on </span><st1:date month="10" day="25" year="1979"><span>October 25, 1979</span></st1:date><span>, affirmed the 
appealed </span>order.<span>&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of petitioner's appeal led to 
the filing of the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner assails the action taken by the respondent Deputy 
Minister of Labor as done with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or 
in excess of jurisdiction.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends that Policy 
Instruction <span>No. 6 of the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE) indicates 
that the Regional Director has no jurisdiction to hear and decide unfair labor 
practice cases because the exclusive original jurisdiction over such labor cases 
belongs to the Conciliation Section of the Regional Office of the MOLE.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioner avers, that such cases, therefore, should be first resolved by 
the Labor Arbiter and not the Regional Director.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>This contention is undeserving of the Court's 
favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The fact appears that at the initial hearing conducted on March 7, 
1979 by the Regional Director, it was agreed upon by the parties to consolidate 
the two cases being litigated considering that both cases concern the same 
parties and the issues involved are interrelated (Decision of the Regional 
Director, p. 20, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioner obviously accepted the jurisdiction of the Regional Director 
by presenting his evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>By having asked for affirmative 
relief, without challenging the Regional Director's power to hear and try his 
complaint for unfair labor practice, he cannot rightfully now challenge the 
resolution made in said cases by the same Director, based on the latter's 
alleged lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Tijam</em></span><em> vs. 
Sibonghanoy</em>, 23 SCRA 29, it has been stated that "after voluntarily 
submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the me<span>rits, it 
is too late for the loser to question the jurisdiction or power of the court." 
Therein, <span class="GramE">We</span> stated that the Court "frowns upon the 
undesirable practice of a party submitting his case for decision and then 
accepting the judgment, only if favorable, and attacking it for lack of 
jurisdiction when adverse."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In <span class="SpellE"><em>Ching</em></span><em> vs. 
Ramolete</em>, 51 SCRA 14, this view was reiterated, and <span class="GramE">We</span> quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div align="right">xxx</div></td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Having invoked the jurisdiction of the trial court to secure an 
affirmative relief against his opponents, petitioner may not now be allowed to 
repudiate or question the same jurisdiction after failing to obtain such 
relief.<span>&nbsp; </span>While jurisdiction of a tribunal may be challenged at any 
<span>time, sound public policy bars petitioner from doing so after having 
procured </span>that jurisdiction himself, speculating on the fortunes of 
litigation."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner avers that respondent Minister of Labor erred in 
affirming the findings of the Regional Director that he violated Company Rule 
No. 19(a) twice and his dismissal was, therefore, unwarranted.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This issue raised by petitioner relates to questions of fact.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It has been held, however, in numerous cases, that as a <span>general 
rule, </span>the findings of fact of the trial court or quasi-judicial bodies 
are binding on this Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>This principle should <span>be applied 
in the instant cases, considering that the findings of respondent Deputy 
Minister of Labor are supported by the evidence he appreciated.<span>&nbsp; </span>As 
a matter of fact, the petitioner was caught for the second time by no less that 
the Manager of respondent's company, in actual violation of the rule prohibiting 
the use of the company vehicle for private purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Lastly, petitioner asserts that in affirming his dismissal, the 
Deputy Minister of Labor violated the constitutional provision of the security 
of tenure of employees and that assuming that he indeed violated the company 
rule, the fact remains that the damage caused by him, if any, to the company, is 
only very minimal which should not warrant the imposition of a penalty of 
dismissal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner submits that he has been employed in the 
company for eighteen (18) years.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner avers that the damage 
inflicted on MERCO by his activities due to his misuse of the company vehicle 
during working <span>hours did not hamper the </span>smooth <span>business 
operations of MERCO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">However, what should not be overlooked is the prerogative of an 
employer company to prescribe reasonable rules and regulations necessary or 
proper for the conduct of its business and to provide certain disciplinary 
measures in order to implement said rules and to assure that the same would be 
complied with.<span>&nbsp; </span>A rule prohibiting employees from using company 
vehicles for private purpose without authority from management is, from our 
viewpoint, a reasonable one.<span>&nbsp; </span>This regulation cannot be faulted by 
petitioner because this is proper and necessary even <span>if only for an 
orderly conduct of <span class="SpellE">MERCO's</span> business.<span>&nbsp; 
</span></span>From the evidence presented, petitioner twice used the company 
vehicle in pursuing his own personal interests, on company time and deviating 
from his authorized route, all without permission. <span>&nbsp;</span>To cap off his 
infractions, petitioners stubbornly declined even to satisfy <span class="SpellE">MERCO's</span> <span>request for an explanation or to attend a 
grievance </span>conference to discuss his violations.<span>&nbsp; </span>Certainly, 
to condone petitioner's own conduct will erode the discipline that an employer 
should uniformly apply so that it can expect compliance to the same rules and 
regulations by its other employees<span>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>Otherwise, the 
rules necessary and proper for the operation of its business, would be gradually 
rendered ineffectual, ignored, and eventually become meaningless.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Court agrees fully with the comment made by the 
respondent Deputy Minister of Labor, represented by the Office of the Solicitor 
General, that —<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not unmindful of the fact that petitioner has, as he 
says, been employed with petitioner <span>Company for eighteen (18) 
years.<span>&nbsp; </span>On this singular </span>consideration, the Court deems it 
proper to afford some equitable relief to petitioner due to the past services
