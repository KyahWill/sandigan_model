				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Rape is essentially an offense of secrecy, not generally attempted
except in dark, or deserted and secluded places, away from prying eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence it is that a prosecution for the crime
usually commences solely upon the word of the offended woman herself, and
conviction invariably turns only upon her credibility as the people's single
witness of the actual occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
consequently behooves the court to exercise the greatest degree of care and
caution in the consideration and analysis of her testimony, and no conviction should
be handed down except only if it appears that her sincerity and candor are free
from suspicion.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused may, to be sure, be convicted even on the sole basis
of complainant's testimony provided this be credible, natural and convincing,
and otherwise consistent with human nature and the course of things;<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
to suffice for conviction, her testimony must be free of serious contradiction,
and ring true throughout;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and in the assessment of the testimonial credit of the wronged woman, evidence
of her conduct immediately after the alleged assault is of utmost importance.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
These norms are unfortunately not met by the evidence given by the offended
party herself in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acquittal of the appellant on reasonable doubt must perforce be this
Court's verdict.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>, was
convicted by the Regional Trial Court at <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> of
the crime of rape perpetrated against Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> and
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>
</i>and indemnify the latter in the amount of P30,000.00, as well as to pay the
costs of the action.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The complainant, Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>, is married to <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> is the
first cousin of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court accorded full credit to Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez's</span>
sole, uncorroborated testimony, now briefly summarized hereunder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rape, Ruby says, took place on the night of <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1985</st1:date> in her house in <span class="SpellE">Malipampang</span>, San <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
small, one-storey house, measuring eight by ten feet, with an entrance but no
door, and two windows, one covered with transparent plastic and the other, fine
chicken wire and coarse burlap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
alone in the house, except for her two children, six and two years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span>,
was away, at work in the adjacent <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> of <span class="SpellE">Calawitan</span>, threshing <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="font-size: 7pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11 o'clock</st1:time>
that night, Ruby says she was awakened by the weight of a man on top of her,
who was kissing her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to
scream, but the man covered her mouth with one hand while with the other, he
raised her blouse and grasped one of her breasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pushed him away by his right shoulder but
he took hold of her hands and threw them forcefully to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then pinned her thighs with his
knees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ruby says that at this point she
could no longer put up any resistance, and the man succeeded in raising her
skirt and removing her panties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
while in some sort of shock, she felt him penetrate her and consummate his
lust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left immediately afterwards,
but not before threatening her with harm should she tell her husband of the
incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> says, too, that although
there was no longer any lamp lit in the house at the time, there was some light
streaming in from her neighbor's house, and by that light, she recognized
appellant because of his build.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruby says her husband, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>, came home about an hour later, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> was riding a motorized tricycle
operated by his cousin, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, Alfredo had brought <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> to his place of work in the morning of that same
day; in fact, and already for about two (2) weeks, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>
had been taking <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> to his place of work and
fetching him <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruby did not tell her husband on his arrival of what his cousin
had done to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to relate the
event to her husband the following morning but was unable to complete her
narrative, for when she came to the part where she said that Alfredo had
embraced and kissed her, and touched her private parts, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span>
had become so enraged that she no longer told him of the rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to her, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span>
had immediately rushed out of the house in search of his cousin but did not
find him until several days later, when he came upon Alfredo driving his
tricycle; <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> boxed Alfredo but the latter did
not stop and thus avoided any further harm.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruby says she presented a formal accusation against Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> six (6) days later, on <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accompanied by her mother-in-law, she went to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain and before him executed a written complaint, but alleged only that
Alfredo had embraced and kissed her, and touched her private parts on the night
of <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She made no mention of the rape because,
according to her, she had not yet told her husband about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did so only two (2) days later, on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1985</st1:date>, nine (9) days
after the supposed rape, after which she went back to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain to report the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
latter's direction, however, it was to the police instead that she ultimately
reported Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez's</span> violation of her chastity;
and in the evening of the same day, she submitted herself to a medical
examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> was arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Alfredo was in the municipal jail --
and according to Ruby, as she, her husband, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span>,
and the latter's sister, Edna, were walking past his cell -- ­he pleaded for
pity and forgiveness.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the Trial Court pronounced Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez's</span> testimony of the foregoing facts adequate to
establish the appellant's guilt of the felony of rape beyond reasonable doubt,
overruling in the process the latter's <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
defense of alibi and his submission that Ruby's evidence was fatally flawed by
grave contradictions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court did not believe Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez's</span>
story, narrated on the witness stand in his defense, that he did not commit and
could not have committed the crime imputed to him because at the time of its
alleged perpetration, he was then in <span class="SpellE">Calawitan</span>, three
kilometers away from Ruby's house in <span class="SpellE">Malipampang</span>;
that he was in <span class="SpellE">Calawitan</span>, precisely to fetch and
bring home on his tricycle Ruby's husband, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span>,
and his (appellant's) own brother, Eduardo; that on that night, he had left <span class="SpellE">Malipampang</span> for <span class="SpellE">Calawitan</span> at 9:50
o'clock, and he and his companions had left <span class="SpellE">Calawitan</span>
for home at about 11:45 o'clock, riding on his tricycle; that when they arrived
at <span class="SpellE">Edmundo's</span> house, they had partaken of some milk
served by Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> herself, and he had smoked a
cigarette before leaving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did
the Trial Court believe that Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez's</span> testimony
was seriously at odds with her sworn statement before the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain or the other evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> has appealed to this
Court and prays for reversal of the Trial Court's verdict, arguing that the
Court <i>a quo </i>erred in:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“giving credence to the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and ** disregarding the evidence for
the defense;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“convicting ** (him) despite
the failure of the prosecution to fully establish ** (his) identity **;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“convicting ** (him)
despite the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable
doubt.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rule, of course, is that the findings and conclusions of
trial courts, which have the opportunity to directly observe the demeanor of
the witnesses and analyze the evidence at first hand, should be accorded great
respect and should not generally be disturbed on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception is when it appears that the
Trial Court has ignored or failed to appreciate facts and circumstances of such
weight and substance as to place in grave doubt the validity of its findings
and conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case at bar is
comprehended in the exception and on this account must terminate in the appellant's
absolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are perceived defects in Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez's</span>
testimony which militate against according it the full credit it was given by
the Trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considered singly and
independently of any other, the defects might not suffice to overturn the Trial
Court's judgment of conviction; but assessed and weighed conjointly, as logic
and fairness dictate, they exert a powerful compulsion towards reversal of said
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is in the first place the improbability inhering in Ruby's
account of her violation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is plain
from the evidence that Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> was
unarmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He carried no instrument of
violence of any kind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He uttered no
threats against Ruby or her children, who were sleeping beside her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet she would have the Court believe that the
accused, without weapons or threats, had rendered her unable to resist his
lustful aggression by first covering her mouth with one hand and holding one of
her breasts, then flinging her hands to the ground, and pinning her knees with
his thighs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had thereby become so
helpless that the appellant was able to remove her panties and satisfy his
perverse desires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And all the while that
the accused was preparing to carry out his lustful intent, the only physical
resistance she offered was to push him back by his right shoulder, and to
mumble the word, “traitor.” She did not try to slap him, scratch his face, hit
him, box him, kick him, get away from under him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her first attempt, she made no further
effort to shout or scream; nor did she seek to wake the children lying beside
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after the appellant had
allegedly satisfied himself that he uttered a vague threat of some harm that
would befall her if she should tell her husband of the happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A story such as this does not inspire belief
of the commission of a felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather,
it indicates either that the sexual encounter did not occur at all, or that it
was consented to by the woman after some initial reluctance.</p>

<p class="BODY">If she had in truth been raped, it would normally be expected
that she would tell her husband about it immediately on his return from work,
perhaps with much revulsion, distress, weeping.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not only did she not tell her husband about her repulsive violation when
he arrived with her violator, she also proceeded --according to the appellant
-- to serve them milk.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, it is undisputed that no report to the police or any
municipal authority was made by Ruby until after six (6) days from the alleged
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that on <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1985</st1:date>, Ruby executed a
sworn statement before the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain, Exhibit
“1,” in which she declared the following:<span style="font-size: 6pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style=""> </span>on the night and at the
place in question, the appellant had indeed laid himself on top of her, kissed
her, and touched her breast and private parts;<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style=""> </span>but she had resisted; she
had kicked him and cursed him aloud;</p>

<p class="BODY">3)<span style=""> </span>and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> had desisted from any further sexual assault and left
the house when she threatened to tell her husband about the event;</p>

<p class="BODY">4)<span style=""> </span>she did tell her husband
about Alfredo's attack however, on the following night;</p>

<p class="BODY">5)<span style=""> </span>her husband had not then
said anything although it seemed to her that he harbored ill feelings towards
her attacker, his cousin.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her sworn statement is palpably in contradiction of her testimony
in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In court she declared that
Alfredo had actually consummated the rape; in Exhibit 1, Alfredo had committed
at most attempted rape or <span class="SpellE"><i>abusos</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">deshonestos</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
court, Ruby did not mention the kicking and loud cursing she claims in Exhibit
1 to have made at the time that Alfredo was attempting against her virtue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not say in Court that she had
threatened to tell her husband about the attack, as she does in Exhibit 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told the Court she informed her husband
about Alfredo's crime on the following morning, contrary to what she says in
Exhibit 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In court, Ruby said that when
she told her husband about Alfredo's offense, her husband had become so
terribly infuriated that he had immediately rushed out to avenge the wrong done
to his wife; whereas in Exhibit 1, Ruby says that her husband had merely kept
silent although he appeared resentful.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are strange contradictions regarding events which are fairly
simple and uncomplicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may also be asked, if Ruby had already unburdened herself to
her husband about his cousin's attempt to rape her, why the formal complaint of
that offense was not made to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain
until six (6) days later, or on November 26.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it is true that her husband had become fiercely furious in the
morning of November 21, 1985 -- instead of merely keeping silent, as Ruby says
in her Exhibit 1 -- so furious in fact that he had rushed out to look for the
appellant and exact revenge, there is no reason why a report of the crime -- at
least as much of it as had thus far been disclosed by Ruby -- should not have
been made until several days afterward.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And when at last the formal complaint was made on November 26, 1985
before the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain, there is still the
intriguing question why the complaint was not of consummated rape, but only of
an attempt to commit it; for surely, this was already the appropriate time <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
husband could not have become angrier, by this time his rage must have already
somewhat subsided, he having already sought out his cousin, found him and boxed
him, and so the apprehension that he would try to kill his wife's assailant had
become quite remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no longer
a strong enough reason to still withhold the real nature of the offense
allegedly committed against Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet it still took another two days before a
complaint charging the supposedly correct crime was submitted to the
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inconsistencies such as these
cannot but detract from Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez's</span> credit as a
witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, too, the oddity of the complainant's own reaction on
seeing the person who had allegedly raped her only about an hour earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not accuse him, revile or denounce
him, show rage, revulsion, disgust.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, she served him some milk, and suffered him to stay at her home
and leisurely smoke a cigarette before going home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a nonchalant, unconcerned attitude is
totally at odds with what might naturally be expected of a person who had just
suffered the ultimate invasion of her womanhood.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is highly unlikely, in addition, even foolish or foolhardy,
one might say, considering the routine established over twenty days between
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> and his first cousin, <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> -- i.e., Alfredo would bring <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span>
on his tricycle to the latter's place of work at a neighboring <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> in the morning and then pick him up from that
place late at night to bring him home on the same tricycle -- for Alfredo to
sexually assault his cousin's wife shortly before leaving to fetch her husband
from work, and actually to bring him home to his just ravished wife, enter her
home and stay there for a few minutes, drinking milk and smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is furthermore the negativity or innocuousness of the
medical examination to which Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> eventually
submitted herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examination
disclosed no sign of any violence on her person, no indication that she was the
victim of a rape at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, it
might be stated that no such signs or indications could be expected from a
medical examination undertaken eight or nine days after the supposed rape; but
this certainly is not a fault for which the appellant should be blamed; it is a
situation for which Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> must take exclusive
responsibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, there is the admission elicited from Ruby <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> that there was a misunderstanding between her family
and the appellant's family concerning the sale of a parcel of land, in
connection with which, in Ruby's own words, appellant's “parents and other
members of the family are trying to disgrace me because of that incident;” and
although she explained that her family “ignored that incident ** (and) tried to
have a smooth relationship with ** (Alfredo's) family **,” the possibility of
some ulterior motivation on Ruby's part for <span class="SpellE">proferring</span>
her inconsistent criminal complaints cannot be altogether ignored.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be conceded that the appellant's defense of alibi is
weak;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the facts upon which it is based do not totally preclude his being present at
the scene of the crime at the time of its supposed commission, considering the
proximity thereof to the place where he claimed he was on that occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The settled rule, however, is that conviction
should rest on the strength of the prosecution's evidence and not on the
weakness of the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, it appears to the court that the prosecution has failed to
present proof sufficient to overcome the constitutional presumption of
innocence in appellant's favor who therefore, merits acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are in this case, as earlier pointed out, “facts of
substance and value militating against an affirmation of the finding of guilt,”
and this proscribes the imposition of any criminal sanction on the accused,
“particularly when the evidentiary rule is recalled that in crimes against
chastity, the testimony of the injured woman should not be received with
precipitate credulity, and when the conviction depends at any vital point on
her uncorroborated testimony, it should not be accepted unless her sincerity
and candor are free from suspicion.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering and appraising the entirety of the evidence, it is not possible for
this Court to declare that the complaining witness’ sincerity and candor are
indeed free from suspicion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is REVERSED, and the
