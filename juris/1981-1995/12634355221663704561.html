SPOUSES HERMINIA AND PATROCINIO GALMAN; SPOUSES REMEDIOS AND BENJAMIN MENDOZA; PASCUAL

				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This tangled case involves the conflicting claims of the herein
petitioners to the ownership of a building allegedly constructed by them
pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement concluded with Agustina Manaloto, one of
the private respondents, and of the other private respondents’ right to occupy
part of the said building by virtue of an earlier sublease contract signed by
them, also with Manaloto.  The
controversy has been complicated by the death of Manaloto, who is now
represented by her only heir.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal by <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, the petitioners
allege that in its resolution dated July 29, 1977, the respondent Court of
Appeals adjudicated the case even before the lower court had commenced trial;
that the said court based its resolution on a compromise agreement in which the
petitioners had no participation; and that the private respondents’ act in
filing a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> before the Court of Appeals was
improper.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present petition seeks the reinstatement of an earlier
decision promulgated on March 30, 1976, by the same Court of Appeals on the
basis of the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents Patrocinio Galman, Benjamin and Remedios
Mendoza and Pascual Alcaraz (the Galman group) filed a complaint (later
amended) against the petitioners and their co-respondent, Agustina Manaloto,
for annulment of documents, recovery of possession and damages with preliminary
injunction and preliminary mandatory injunction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
They sought to enforce their right to occupy three store spaces in a building
located on a government lot in Quiapo, Manila, pursuant to a contract of
sublease they had entered into in 1961 with Manaloto, who was the lessee of the
said lot.  The herein petitioners claim
the building was constructed at their expense by virtue of a Memorandum of
Agreement concluded with Manaloto in 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the trial, Judge Amador E. Gomez of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, Branch I, issued an order on October 17, 1972, establishing
a “temporary arrangement” among the parties regarding the occupancy of the
disputed store spaces pending litigation whereby the Galman group would each
pay the petitioners P500.00 as monthly rental and P5,500.00 as goodwill for
every door.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
After two years, herein petitioners (and Manaloto) moved to amend this
arrangement by increasing the goodwill and the monthly rental.  Judge Carlos L. Sundiam of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, Branch 28, who took over the case after the
retirement of Judge Gomez, granted the motion on January 24, 1975, increasing
the goodwill to P30,000.00 and the monthly rental to P1,200.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The case was subsequently reassigned to Judge Manuel T. Reyes of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, Branch 9, who further amended the October 17, 1972
order by decreasing the monthly rental to P1,000.00 and the goodwill to
P25,000.00 in an order dated June 9, 1975.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 2, 1975, the Galman group filed a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
with the Court of Appeals praying for the annulment of Judge Sundiam’s order of
January 24, 1975 and Judge Reyes’s order of June 9, 1975 and for the issuance
of a writ of preliminary injunction to stop the sheriff from executing the said
orders.  They claimed that the
“temporary arrangement” dictated by Judge Gomez in his October 17, 1972 order
was a contract and that Judge Sundiam and Judge Reyes acted with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in issuing their respective orders
which had the effect of altering the agreement between the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals originally dismissed the petition and
dissolved the temporary restraining order it had earlier issued against the
enforcement of the challenged orders.  Justice
Mariano V. Agcaoili declared that the said</p>

<blockquote>x x x orders are well within the
jurisdiction of the lower court to promulgate inasmuch as the original order of
October 17, 1972 has been issued under the direction and control of the lower
court who had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case and the parties
thereto which jurisdiction continues to reside therein until the final
determination of the case.  Such being
the case, it lies within the legal power and jurisdiction of the lower court to
make subsequent amendments thereto after the parties had been duly heard and to
them a more equitable and fair arrangement as warranted by conditions obtaining
at the time of its amendment.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On a motion for reconsideration filed by the Galman group,
however, the respondent court reversed its judgment on July 29, 1977 and
enforced a “Compromise Agreement” entered into between the Galman group and
Manaloto which the trial court was ordered to adopt and implement.  The agreement read in full as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>COMPROMISE AGREEMENT<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>COME NOW the plaintiffs Herminia Verde Galman, Pascual Alcaraz and
Remedios Mendoza and defendant Agustina Manaloto and by way of final settlement
of the case agree to move the Honorable Court to render judgment on the
following compromise:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  That on the three (3)
door spaces occupied by the three plaintiffs, said plaintiffs will pay Agustina
Manaloto the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">a.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Goodwill as suggested by Judge Gomez in the
sum of P11,000.00 so that the P5,000.00 already paid by them, plaintiff will
pay an additional P5,000.00 which Agustina Manaloto hereby acknowledges as
received by her in full;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">b.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The rental start on August 1976 shall be
P1,000.00 per door space;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">c.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That this agreement is without prejudice and
it shall not effect the claim for one (1) door space of Mrs. Galman which is
now occupied by Antonio Banzagales;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">d.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the amount of P20,000.00 which was given
by Herminia Galman to Mrs. Agustina Manaloto in monthly amortizations of
P5,000.00 the first amortizations to be due on August 1, 1978 and every
succeeding month thereafter until fully paid; the parties hereby agree that no
amount shall be repaid by Agustina Manaloto to Remedios Mendoza or to Loyda
Justiniano (Pascual Alcaraz).</p>

<blockquote>2.  That Agustina Manaloto
has entered into this final agreement upon the statement of Antonio Banzagales;
“Sigue, hinahamon ko kayo na kumapit kina Galman at hindi ako magbibigay sa
hinihingi ninyo sa akin at tignan natin kung ano ang magagawa ninyo” and as
owner of the Building she hereby exercises her full right to enter into this
final agreement regarding the three (3) door spaces to plaintiffs Galman,
Mendoza and Alcaraz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  That the duration of
this agreement will be for as long as this contract of Agustina Manaloto with
the Bureau of Building including its extension, and the terms hereof shall be
binding on all the successors-in-­interest of all the plaintiffs and of the
defendant Agustina Manaloto.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we have signed this AGREEMENT in the City of
Manila, Philippines, this 27th day of November, 1976.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is this decision that is challenged in this petition on the
ground that the respondent court had usurped the power of the trial court to
determine and establish the very issue pending before it, to wit, the legal
relationship of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have examined the records and must agree with the
petitioners.  A perusal of the assailed
resolution shows that the Court of Appeals has, indeed, exceeded its
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The challenged orders were intended merely to maintain an
equitable scheme regarding the use and/or possession of the store spaces in
issue pending resolution of certain basic questions, among them whether the
contract of lease signed by the Galman group and Manaloto in 1961 covers the
building allegedly constructed by the petitioners; if it is true, as alleged,
that the Galman group contributed to the cost of the building; the validity of
the Memorandum of Agreement concluded, and later amended, in 1972; and the
liability, if any, of Manaloto to the petitioners for the cost of the building.  These questions may be answered only after
trial on the merits where the parties should be given a chance to be heard and
to present their respective positions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The October 17, 1972 order of Judge Gomez was acceptable to the
Galman group until the amount of the rental and the goodwill was subsequently
increased.  It was then that they
complained by suing for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> with the Court of
Appeals.  As earlier noted, the
respondent court reconsidered its decision of July 29, 1977 and adopted instead
a Compromise Agreement entered into between Manaloto and the Galman group, to
the total exclusion of the herein petitioners.  By so doing, the respondent court in effect decided the case on the
merits, thus arrogating a function pertaining only to the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Galman group acted precipitately in filing the petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
with the Court of Appeals.  Interlocutory orders, such as the orders subject of the Galman group’s
petition, cannot be reviewed by the appellate court until trial on the merits
shall have been held and final judgment is rendered.  <i><u>Certiorari</u></i> was clearly not the proper remedy at the
time.  And even if it were in fact
permitted, it would nevertheless not lie because it has not been shown that the
questioned orders were issued with grave abuse of discretion.  The “temporary arrangement” decreed by Judge
Gomez was an expedient measure intended to govern the relations of the parties
pending decision of the case on the merits.</p>

<blockquote>If the Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter and of the
person, <u>orders or decisions upon all questions pertaining to the cause are
orders and decisions within its jurisdiction and, however irregular or
erroneous they may be, they cannot corrected by <i>certiorari</i></u>.  (Villa Rey Transit, Inc. vs. Bello, 7 SCRA
735; Associated Union vs. Ramolete, 13 SCRA 582; emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>A writ<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>of <i><u>certiorari</u></i>,
in order to succeed, must be based on jurisdictional grounds, because, as long
as the respondent acted with jurisdiction <u>any error committed by it in the
exercise thereof will amount to nothing more than an error of judgment</u>
which may be reviewed or corrected only by appeal.  (Abig vs. Constantino, L-12460, May 31, 1961, 2 SCRA 299;
emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The final issue to be resolved is the enforceability of the
compromise agreement applied by the respondent court in its resolution of March
30, 1976.  This agreement, which was
concluded by and between the Galman group and Manaloto only, declared the
latter as the owner of the building where the disputed store spaces are situated
and fixed the amount of the rentals and the goodwill to be paid to
Manaloto.  It was considered a <u>final
settlement of the case</u>.  Yet the
herein petitioners, who are claiming title to the building in dispute, were not
signatories of the agreement and were totally excluded therefrom.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is axiomatic that anyone who is not a party to a contract or
agreement cannot be bound by its terms.  Hence, the herein petitioners, not having participated in the compromise
agreement, cannot be affected by it.  Article 1311(1) of the Civil Code provides that “contracts take effect
only between the parties, their assigns and heirs, except in case where the
rights and obligations arising from the contract are not transmissible by their
nature, or by stipulation or by provision of law ....” This principle is echoed
in Rule 130, Section 25, of the Rules of Court, which states that “the rights
of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of
another.” <u>Res inter alios acta alteri nocere non debet</u>.  There are, of course, exceptions to this
rule, but none of them is present in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties have been clamoring for a speedy settlement of the
controversy, but it is not for this Court to decide it on the merits.  This function belongs only to the trial
court, to which the case must be returned for proper disposition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution of the respondent Court of
Appeals dated July 29, 1977 is hereby SET ASIDE and its decision dated March
30, 1976, REINSTATED.  This case is
hereby remanded to the trial court, which is directed to hear and decide it
with all possible dispatch.  SO ORDERED.</p>
