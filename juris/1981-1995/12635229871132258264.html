This petition for <em>certiorari </em>seeks to review the decision of 
the then Court of Appeals (now Intermediate Appellate Court under BP 
129) dated August 31, 1972, affirming the validity of the resolution of 
the Social Security Commission denying favorable consideration of the 
claim for benefits of the petitioner under the Group Redemption 
Insurance plan of the Social Security System (SYSTEM).  The dispositive 
portion of the re­spondent Court's decision reads as follows:
<blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the Court hereby upholds the validity of the appealed 
resolution No. 1365, dated December 24, 1968, of appellee Social 
Security Commis­sion; without pronouncement as to costs" (p. 31, Rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The undisputed facts are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> On or about January 1, 1965, upon application of the SYSTEM, Group
 Mortgage Redemption Policy No. GMR-1 was issued by Private Life 
Insurance Com­panies operating in the Philippines for a group life 
insurance policy on the lives of housing loan mortgagors of the SYSTEM. 
 Under this Group Mortgage Redemption scheme, a grantee of a housing 
loan of the SYSTEM is required to mortgage the house con­structed out of
 the loan and the lot on which it stands.  The SYSTEM takes a life 
insurance on the eligible mortgagor to the extent of the mortgage 
indebtedness such that it the mortgagor dies, the proceeds of his life 
insurance under the Group Redemption Policy will be used to pay his 
indebted­ness to the SYSTEM and the deceased's heirs will thereby be 
relieved of the burden of paying for the amortization of the deceased's 
still unpaid loan to the SYSTEM (p. 25, rec.). </p>
  <p>
    Petitioner herein is the widow of the late Bernardo G. Serrano, who,
 at the time of his death, was an airline pilot of Air Manila, Inc. and 
as such was a member of the Social Security System.
  </p>
  <p>
    On November 10, 1967, the SYSTEM approved the real estate mortgage 
loan of the late Bernardo G. Serrano for P37,400.00 for the construction
 of the applicant's house (pp. 25-26, rec.).
  </p>
  <p>
    On December 26, 1967, a partial release in the amount of P35,400.00 
was effected and devoted to the construction of the house (p. 2, rec.). 
 As a consequence, a mortgage contract was executed in favor of the 
SYSTEM by the late Captain Serrano with his wife as co-mortgagor.
  </p>
  <p>
    On March 8, 1968, Captain Serrano died in a plane crash and because 
of his death, the SYSTEM closed his housing loan account to the released
 amount of P35,400.00 (p. 26, rec.).
  </p>
  <p>
    On December 2, 1968, the petitioner sent a letter addressed to the 
Chairman of the Social Security Commission requesting that the benefits 
of the Group Mortgage Redemption Insurance be extended to her.
  </p>
  <p>
    The letter of the petitioner was referred to the Administrator of 
the SYSTEM, who recommended its disapproval on the ground that the late 
Captain Serrano was not yet covered by the Group Mortgage Redemption 
Insurance policy at the time of his death on March 8, 1968.  In its 
resolution No. 1365 dated December 24, 1968, the Social Security 
Commission sustained the said stand of the SYSTEM and thereby formally 
denied the request of the petitioner (p. 26, rec.).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On appeal to the then Court of Appeals, the respondent Court affirmed the decision of the Social Security Commission.
</p><p>
Hence, this petition.
</p><p>
The only issue to be resolved is the correct­ness of the interpretation 
given by the respondent Commission which was upheld by the respondent 
Court as to the applicability of the Mortgage Redemption Insurance plan 
particularly on when coverage on the life of the mortgagor commences.
</p><p>
Article II (Insurance Coverage) of the Group Mortgage Redemption Policy No. GMR-1 provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "<em>Section 1. Eligibility</em> -- Every mortgagor who is not 
over age 65 nearest birthday at the time the Mortgage Loan is granted 
(or, in the case of a Mortgagor applying for in­surance coverage, on a 
Mortgage Loan granted before the Date of Issue, at the time he makes 
such application) and who would not be over 75 nearest birthday on the 
date on which the original term of the Mortgage Loan expires shall be 
eligible for insurance coverage under this Policy, provided that if the 
total indebtedness to the Creditor under the new Mortgage Loan and the 
outstanding balance of any prior Mortgage Loan or Loans insured 
hereunder, exceeds P70,000.00, he will be eligible for insurance 
coverage up to this maximum limit only. </p>
  <p> "Co-makers or co-signers of mortgage contract are not eligible for coverage under this Policy. </p>
  <p> "<em>Section 2. Mode of Acceptance</em> -- Any Mortgagor who is 
eligible for coverage on or after the Date of Issue shall be 
automatically insured, subject to the amount of insurance limit in 
Section 1 hereof, without proof of insurability provided that he is not 
more than age 60 nearest birthday at the time the Mortgage Loan is 
granted.  Such a mortgagor who is over age 60 nearest birthday at the 
time the Mortgage Loan is granted may be accepted for insurance only 
subject to the submission of evidence of insurability satisfactory to 
the Subscribing Companies. </p>
  <p> "Any eligible Mortgagor who was already a Mortgagor before the 
Date of Issue shall be automatically insured, subject to the amount of 
insurance limit in Section 1 hereof, without proof of insurability 
provided that he is not more than age 60 nearest birthday on the Date of
 Issue and that he makes written application to the Creditor for 
coverage within ninety (90) days from the Date of Issue.  If such a 
Mortgagor applies for coverage after ninety (90) days from the Date of 
Issue, he may be accepted for insurance upon written application 
therefor, subject to the submission of evidence of insurability to the 
Subscribing Companies. </p>
  <p> "<em>Section 3. Effective Date of Insurance</em> -- The insurance 
on the life of each eligible Mortgagor Loan or partial release of 
Mortgage Loan accepted for coverage who becomes a Mortgagor on or after 
the Date of Issue <em>shall take effect from the beginning of the amortization period of such Mortgage Loan or partial release of Mortgage Loan</em>. </p>
  <p> "The beginning of the amortization period as used herein shall 
mean the first day of the month preceding the month in which the first 
monthly amorti­zation payment falls due. </p>
  <p> "It is hereby understood that before any release on any approved 
Mortgage Loan is made by the Cre­ditor, the requisites binding the 
Mortgagor and the Creditor as regards to said Mortgage Loan shall have 
been completed. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xx                              xx                                 xx 
  </p>
  <p>
    (pp. 59-60, rec.; Italics supplied).
  </p>
  <p>
  A careful analysis of the provisions leads to the conclusion that the 
respondent Court of Appeals erred in construing the effectivity date of 
insurance coverage from the beginning of the amortization period of the 
loan.
  </p>
  <p>
  WE REVERSE.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There can be no doubt as to the eligibility of the late Captain Serrano 
for coverage under Section 1 of Article II of the Group Mortgage 
Redemption Insurance Policy as he was a mortgagor of the Social Security
 System not over the age of 65 nearest his birthday at the time when the
 mortgage loan was granted to him (p. 26, rec.).  This fact was admitted
 not only by the Social Security Commission but also accepted by the 
Court of Appeals.
</p><p>
The problem manifests itself in Sections 2 and 3 of the same article of 
the Group Mortgage Redemption Insurance Policy.  Section 2 provides that
 "<em>any mortgagor who is eligible for coverage on or after the Date of Issue shall be automatically insured</em>,
 x x" (Italics supplied); while Section 3 provides that the insurance 
"shall take effect from the beginning of the amortization period of such
 Mortgage Loan or <em>partial release of Mortgage Loan</em>" (Italics supplied).
</p><p>
Section 2 of Article II of the Group Mortgage Redemption Insurance 
Policy provides that insurance coverage shall be "automatic" and limited
 only by the amount of insurance and age requirement.  While the same 
section has for its title the mode of accept­ance, what is controlling 
is the meaning of the provision itself.  The said section can only 
convey the idea that the mortgagor who is eligible for coverage on or 
after the date of issue shall be automatically insured.  The only 
condition is that the age requirement should be satisfied, which had 
been complied with by the deceased mortgagor in the instant case.
</p><p>
Under said Section 2, mortgage redemption insurance is not just 
automatic; it is compulsory for all qualified borrowers.  This is the 
same automatic redemption insurance applied to all qualified borrowers 
by the GSIS (Government Service Insurance System) and the DBP 
(Development Bank of the Philippines).  Indeed, the Mortgage Redemption 
Insurance Policy of the GSIS provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 2. xx    xx This policy is granted subject to the terms and 
conditions set forth at the back hereof and in consideration of the 
application therefor and <em>shall take effect on  the date of the first date of the aforementioned loan</em>" (p. 126; CA rec.; Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WE take judicial notice of the Mortgage Contract being issued by the 
Social Security System in connection with applications for housing 
loans, specifically Section 16 thereof:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 16 - (a) <em>The loan shall be secured against the death of the borrower through the Mortgage Redemption Insurance Plan</em>; (b) <em>Coverage shall take effect on the date of the first release voucher of the loan</em> and shall continue until the real estate mortgage loan is fully paid; x x x" (Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, Section 3 of Article II presents an ambiguity.  The effective 
date of coverage can be interpreted to mean that the insurance contract 
takes effect "from the beginning of the amortization period of such 
Mortgage Loan" or "partial release of Mortgage Loan."
</p><p>
Applying Article 1374 of the new Civil Code, the mortgagor in the 
instant case was already covered by the insurance upon the partial 
release of the loan.
</p><p>
Article 1374, NCC, reads thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted 
together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result 
from all of them taken jointly."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The ambiguity in Section 3 of Article II should be resolved in favor of 
the petitioner. "The interpretation of obscure words or stipulations in a
 con­tract shall not favor the party who caused the obscurity" (Article 
1377, Civil Code).  WE have held that provisions, conditions or 
exceptions tending to work d forfeiture of insurance policies should be 
construed most strongly against those for whose benefit they are 
inserted, and most favorably toward those against whom they are intended
 to operate (Trinidad vs. Orient Protective Ass. 67 Phil. 181).
</p><p>
While the issuance of the Group<em> Mortgage Redemption Insurance</em> 
is a contract between the Social Security System and the Private Life 
Insurance Companies, the fact is that the SYSTEM entered into such a 
contract to afford protection not only to itself should the mortgagor 
die before fully paying the loan but also to afford protection to the 
mortgagor.  WE take note of the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I.  Insurance Coverage. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "1. Fire insurance - The SSS - financed house shall be covered 
by fire insurance equal to its appraised value or the amount of the 
loan, whichever is lesser. </p>
    <p> "2.  Mortgage Redemption Insurance - Coverage shall be compulsory for any mortgagor who is not more than 60 years old. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "<em>The insured indebtedness on the mortgage as provided in the 
policy shall be deemed paid upon the death of a mortgagor covered under 
the MRI</em>" (Emplo­yees' Benefits &amp; Social Welfare, 1983 Rev. Ed., CBSI, pp. 50-51; Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is imperative to dissect the rationale of the insurance scheme 
envisioned by the Social Security System.  The Mortgage Redemption 
Insurance device is not only for the protection of the SYSTEM but also 
for the benefit of the mortgagor.  On the part of the SYSTEM, it has to 
enter into such form of contract so that in the event of the unexpected 
demise of the mortgagor during the subsistence of the mortgage contract,
 the proceeds from such insurance will be applied to the payment of the 
mortgage debt, thereby relieving the heirs of the mortgagor from paying 
the obligation.  The SYSTEM insures the payment to itself of the loan 
with the insurance proceeds.  It also negates any future problem that 
can crop up should the heirs be not in a position to pay the mortgage 
loan.  In short, the process of amortization is hastened and possible 
litigation in the future is avoided.  In a similar vein, ample 
pro­tection is given to the mortgagor under such a concept so that in 
the event of his death, the mortgage obliga­tion will be extinguished by
 the application of the insurance proceeds to the mortgage indebtedness.
</p><p>
The interpretation of the Social Security Commission goes against the 
very rationale of the insurance scheme.  It cannot unjustly enrich 
itself at the expense of another (<em>Nemo cum alterius detrimento protest</em>).
 "Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the 
performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and 
observe honesty and good faith" (Article 19, Civil Code).  Simply put, 
the SYSTEM cannot be allowed to have the advantage of collecting the 
insurance benefits from the private life insurance companies and at the 
same time avoid its responsibility of giving the benefits of the 
Mortgage Redemption Insurance plan to the mortgagor.  The very reason 
for the existence of the Social Security System is to extend social 
benefits.  For SSS to be allowed to deny benefits to its members, is 
certainly not in keeping with its policy "x x x to establish, develop, 
promote and perfect a sound and viable tax-exempt social security 
service suitable to the needs of the people throughout the Philippines, 
which shall provide to covered employees and their families protection 
against the hazards of disability, sickness, old age, and death with a 
view to promote their well-­being in the spirit of social justice" (The 
Social Security Law, R.A. No. 1161, as amended).
</p><p>
To sustain the position of the SSS is to allow it to collect twice the 
same amount - first from the insurance companies which paid to it the 
amount of the MRI and then from the heirs of the deceased mortgagor.  
This result is unconscionable as it is iniquitous.
</p><p>
It is very clear that the spirit of social justice permeates the 
insurance scheme under the Group Mortgaged Redemption Insurance.  It is a
 wel­come innovation in these times when the concept of social justice 
is not just an empty slogan nor a mere shibboleth.  Social justice is 
explicitly institutionalized and guaranteed under the Constitution, 
(Article II, Section 6, 1973 Constitution).  The con­struction that 
would enhance the State's commitment on social justice mandates Us to 
hold for the petitioner.
</p><p>
Usually, among the items to be deducted by the SYSTEM from the first 
release of the loan is the premium corresponding to the mortgage 
redemption insurance (MRI).  However, if the premium corresponding to 
the amount to be deducted from the first release of the loan was not 
paid by the borrower, the deceased mortgagor, the said unpaid premium 
should be refunded by the heirs of the borrower.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, THE DECISION OF THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMING 
RESOLUTION NO. 1365 OF RESPONDENT COMMISSION IS HEREBY SET ASIDE.  THE 
SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IS HEREBY DIRECTED TO RELEASE THE PETITIONER FROM
 PAYING THE MORTGAGE LOAN.  THE PETITIONER IS HEREBY DIRECTED TO REFUND 
TO THE SSS THE PREMIUM CORRESPONDING TO THE RELEASED AMOUNT, IF THE SAME
 HAD NOT BEEN DEDUCTED THEREFROM.  NO COSTS.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, Escolin</em>, and <em>Cuevas, JJ.</em>, concur.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, J.,</em> in the result.
