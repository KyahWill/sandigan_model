In the defunct Court of First Instance of Leyte, BARTOLOME, CARLOS and 
MARINO all surnamed POGOSA were accused of murder in Criminal Case No. 
486-Ormoc.  The Second Amended Information reads:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "That on or about the 11th day of December, 1973, at around 8:00
 o'clock in the evening at Bo. Ipil, this city, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused BARTOLOME 
POGOSA, <em>CARLOS POGOSA</em> and <em>MARINO POGOSA</em>, conspiring 
together, confederating with and mutually helping and aiding one 
another, with treachery and intent to kill, did and then and there 
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, strike and stab 
the person of EXPEDITO ENCABO, inflicting upon the latter mortal wounds 
which caused his death." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 4.) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
In a decision promulgated on February 11, 1975, the trial court rendered the following judgment:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, this Court finds the accused Bartolome Pogosa guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt as principal in the commission of the crime of 
Murder and this Court hereby sentences said accused BARTOLOME POGOSA, to
 LIFE IMPRISONMENT and to indemnify the heirs of Expedito Encabo in the 
sum of P12,000.00, with all the accessory penalties provided by law and 
to pay the costs. </p>
  <p> "CARLOS POGOSA and MARINO POGOSA are found by this Court guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt as accomplices in the commission of the crime of
 Murder and this Court hereby sentences each of said accused Carlos 
Pogosa and Marino Pogosa to an indeterminate imprisonment of EIGHT (8) 
YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>Prision Mayor</em> in its medium period as the minimum to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>reclusion temporal</em>
 in its medium period as the maximum and to jointly and severally pay 
the heirs of Expedito Encabo in the sum of Twelve Thousand Pesos 
(P12,000.00) with all the accessory penalties provided by law and to pay
 the costs.  (Id., pp. 21-22.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The case is now before Us on appeal by all the three accused.
</p><p>
Bartolome whose sentence is life imprisonment (<em>reclusion perpetua</em>) is the brother of Carlos and Marino is the son of Carlos.
</p><p>
The People's version of the facts is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "About 8:00 p.m. on December 11, 1973, Expedito Encabo, a security
 inspector of the Ormoc Sugar Company (OSCO), and his common-law wife 
Pacita Cuesta de Leon, were taking supper in their house in Bo. Ipil, 
Ormoc City, when they heard sounds of falling pieces of iron.  Encabo 
went out to investigate the noise while his wife continued eating.  A 
few minutes later, Pacita heard her husband calling for help, mentioning
 the names of Paredes and Medy Parrilla, both security guards in the 
nearby compound of OSCO (tsn., Jan. 22, 1975, pp. 4-5).  She went to 
where her husband was calling for help some fifty meters away from their
 house and saw accused Bartolome Pogosa seeking forgiveness from Encabo 
for having caught him in the act of stealing iron scraps belonging to 
the Ormoc Sugar Company.  Encabo refused to pardon Bartolome who had 
been caught stealing several times in the past, and, after a brief 
heated discussion between the two (tsn., pp. 29-38), Bartolome pulled out
 a hunting knife from his waist and stabbed Encabo in the stomach with 
it, despite efforts on the part of the latter to parry the thrust and 
wrest the weapon away from his assailant (tsn., pp. 42-43, id.,).  Encabo
 fell to the ground face downwards, bleeding profusely.  As Pacita tried
 to lift her husband, Bartolome pushed her away and stabbed Encabo 
several times more.  (tsn., pp. 43-44, id.).  Suddenly two persons 
appeared behind Encabo, whom Pacita later identified at the PC 
Headquarters as Carlos Pogosa and Marino Pogosa.  Carlos Pogosa stabbed 
Encabo with a sharp pointed instrument, while Marino Pogosa struck the 
victim at his feet and back with an iron bar.  Before the assailants 
left, Bartolome told Pacita not to bother helping him (Encabo) 'because 
he will surely die.’ (tsn., pp. 8-10, id.).  The wounded Encabo was 
rushed to the OSPA Farmers Medical Center by Security Guard Vicente 
Trinidad of OSCO, accompanied by Pacita (tsn., p. 11, id.).  Five hours 
later, Encabo died. </p>
  <p> "Dr. Rogelio Marson, Assistant City Health Officer of Ormoc City, 
conducted a post-mortem examination of Encabo's body and found the cause
 of death to be hemorrhage secondary to multiple stabbed wounds (Ex. 
E)." (<em>Brief</em>, pp. 2-3.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is the submission of the People that the crime committed was not 
murder but only simple homicide so that the penalties to be meted to the
 appellants should be accordingly reduced.  The People's brief states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We agree with appellants' second assignment of error that the 
killing was not characterized by treachery.  The following circumstances
 show that treachery was not present:  (1) the meeting between accused 
Bartolome Pogosa and the victim was casual; (2) the stabbing was 
preceded by a heated discussion between them; and (3) although the 
victim was unarmed, he was able to put up a semblance of defense by 
trying to wrest the bolo away from his assailant before he was actually 
stabbed. </p>
  <p> "Neither was evident premeditation present in the commission.  The
 evidence does not show that appellants had deliberately planned to kill
 the deceased. </p>
  <p> "The mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender must be 
appreciated in favor of appellant Bartolome Pogosa for, as the evidence 
discloses, he (Bartolome) immediately surrendered to a certain Poton-og 
of the Ormoc City Police Department who brought him to the police 
headquarters.  (tsn., pp. 228­-290)." (Pp. 10-11.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bartolome admits having killed the deceased, Expedito Encabo, but he 
claims that he did so in self-defense.  Carlos and Marino dis­claim 
presence at the scene of the crime.
</p><p>
On the whole the assignment of errors made by the appellants impugns the
 credibility of the prosecution witnesses while claiming credibility for
 their own testimonial evidence.
</p><p>
The appeal must fail except in respect of the denomination of the crime committed.
</p><p>
The testimony of Pacita Encabo is summarized in the People's version of 
the facts.  Another witness was Olegario Paredes, an OSCO security 
guard, who said that he was ordered by Encabo to retrieve the scrap iron
 that had been stolen by Bartolome; that shortly after he left the two 
men, a shout for help was heard; that he saw Bartolome attacking Encabo 
with a bladed weapon even as the latter was avoiding the blows; and that
 Carlos and Marino approached the two adversaries.
</p><p>
Bartolome's claim that he acted in self-defense is too crude to be 
convincing.  The testimony of Pacita Encabo and Olegario Paredes clearly
 shows that there was no unlawful aggression on the part of the 
deceased.  Indeed under the circumstances he could not have been the 
aggressor.  As Security Inspector for the OCSO whose scrap iron had been
 repeatedly stolen, he was in effect the aggrieved party so that in the 
confrontation with Bartolome he was performing a lawful act - not an act
 of aggression.  Moreover, he was not even armed for he was eating his 
evening meal when he left his house to investigate suspicious noises.  
Upon the other hand, it was Bartolome who was armed with a small bolo.  
Accordingly, even if it be assumed for the sake of argument, that the 
deceased had kicked and slapped Bartolome, the use of a bolo under the 
circumstances was not justified for there was no reasonable necessity 
for its use.
</p><p>
That Pacita was the common-law wife of the deceased and Olegario Paredes
 was his subordinate did not disqualify them as witnesses and it was for
 the trial court to appreciate the credibility of the evidence which 
they gave.
</p><p>
As to Carlos and Marino, their defense is alibi - a defense which is not
 only weak but also easily contrived.  In this case the defense will not
 lie.
</p><p>
Carlos and Marino claimed that they were in their respective homes when 
the incident took place.  But their respective homes were barely twenty 
meters away from the scene of the crime so that it was not impossible 
for them to be there.  Moreover, they were positively identified by 
Pacita and Olegario in respect of their participation in the crime.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of the trial court is modified; Bartolome Pogosa
 is found guilty of homicide instead of murder; Carlos Pogosa and 
Marino Pogosa are found guilty as accomplices to the crime of homicide; 
Batolome Pogosa is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty 
of six (6) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as maximum; Carlos and Marino Pogosa are each sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of one (1) year of <em>prision correcional</em>, as minimum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em>,
 as maximum; Bartolome shall indemnify the heirs of Expedito Encabo the 
sum of Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos; and Carlos and Marino shall 
solidarily among themselves be subsidiarily liable for said amount if 
Bartolome be insolvent.  Costs against the appellants.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
