<p class="BODY">After a careful evaluation of the evidence of the parties, the
Court is convinced beyond reasonable doubt that petitioners are guilty of the
offense charged and that they and their deceased brother, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>,
acted in concert to perpetrate the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The witnesses for the prosecution <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span>
A. Jose and <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> Jose who were only an arm's
length behind the victim when he was assaulted by the <span class="SpellE">Manalaysay</span>
brothers directly and positively identified petitioners and their brother <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> as the persons who attacked and mauled the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They categorically stated that
they saw petitioners and <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> deliver fist blows
which hit the victim's head, face and torso.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They also testified that pe<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">titioners
took turns in kicking the victim when he fell to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their testimonies were corroborated in their
material points by Romeo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> who affirmed that the
petitioners joined their brother <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> in attacking
the victim, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> using a metallic object in his
hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The medico-legal necropsy report supports <span class="SpellE">Leonila's</span>
version of the events.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The report shows
that contusions were found on the head, face and back of the victim's body
giving rise to a strong inference that these were the result of multiple blows
and kicks inflicted by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span> thus clearly establish beyond
reasonable doubt that petitioners committed the crime of homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of conspiracy, petitioners assail the trial court's
findings holding them all liable for the crime claiming that conspiracy was not
clearly established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The familiar rule
is that the existence of conspiracy may be inferred from proof of circumstances
which show concurrence of will of the parties in furtherance of a common design
and every act of one of the conspirators in furtherance thereto, is the act of
all [Antonio v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, G.R. No. 57937,

The trial court's finding that there was a concurrence of wills among the four
accused in committing the offense charged was sufficiently established by the
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">First</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, </span>when
the victim approached the accused to settle the earlier altercation between his
sons <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> and Alexander and the accused <span class="SpellE">Ernani</span> and Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Manalaysay</span>,
the accused were all in close conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><u>Second</u>, all the accused delivered fist blows on the victim,
hitting him on his head, face and torso.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The initial blow was delivered by <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalaysay</span>, who using a "<span class="SpellE">llave</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ilesa</span>," hit the victim's head while the latter
was being held by one of the brothers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rest also took turns hitting him on the body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Third</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, </span>when the victim fell, all the
accused took turns kicking his prostrate body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No effort was made by any of them to pacify or prevent the others from
inflicting further harm on the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Fourth</u>,
all the accused immediately left the victim and rushed home together when
people arrived at the scene of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that they hurried away together is a strong indication of their
guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The above circumstances reveal
that the acts of the accused before during and after the incident indicate a
common purpose or design to assault the victim.</p>

credibility of the principal witnesses arguing that all of them were relatives
of the </span>accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their testimonies
are likewise impugned on the ground of alleged contradictions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a close perusal of the evidence
however, the Court finds that the contradictions pointed out are minor
inconsistencies which do not touch upon the commission of the crime and which
do not affect the credibility of the witnesses [Cortez v. Court of Appeals,
