Petitioners seek the reversal of the Resolution dated March 10, 1978 of 
the Minister of Labor affirming <span style="font-style: italic;">in toto</span> the decision dated December 23, 
1976 of the National Labor Relations Commission dismissing the complaint
 in NLRC Case No. 215-76 for Non-payment of Emergency Living Allowance 
(Violation of PD No. 525 and Letter of Instruction No. 174).
<p>
The Solicitor General was required to file comment but instead of 
submitting his comment on the petition, filed a manifestation that he 
cannot sustain the questioned decision and moved that he be relieved 
from the task of preparing such comment.
</p><p>
Petitioners allege in their complaint that the Proposed Salary 
Adjustment of Plant Employees of respondent Corporation was not in 
substantial compliance with PD 525 and LOI 174 since by mere glancing at
 the rate or amount of the alleged increase, ranging from a lowly sum of
 twenty-five (P0.25) centavos a day to fifty (P50.00) pesos a month, one
 can readily conclude that it was not really meant to take the place of 
the emergency allowance mandated by law.  They however admitted that the
 company responded to the President's appeal to grant emergency living 
allowance of P50 each month, but only for a brief span of three (3) 
months, from February to May, 1974 and thereafter, it was cancelled 
pursuant to an Office Order No. 74-74 designated as "Salary Adjustment 
of Plant Employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  In 
addition, petitioners averred that the said order was implemented to do 
away with the mandatory compliance with the presidential decree and 
letter of instruction, and that the salary adjustment which was purely a
 management increase based on "merit system" and "job efficiency of the 
workers," cannot be considered as a substitute for the emergency living 
allowance.
</p><p>
The Executive Labor Arbiter on December 23, 1976, dismissed the worker's
 complaint on a holding that the P50.00 emergency cost of living 
allowance can adequately be absorbed by the salary adjustment since it 
was categorically stated by the company that the said allowance was 
already incorporated to the basic salary.
</p><p>
The National Labor Relations affirmed in toto the arbiter's decision on 
appeal, thus prompting the workers to file the instant petition for <em>certiorari </em>raising
 lone issue of whether or not the salary adjustment granted to the 
workers can be considered as the emergency living allowance provided for
 under PD No. 525 in connection with letter of Instruction No. 174.
</p><p>
Petitioners assail the injustice and discrimination committed by 
respondent company, taking into account the rates of increases given 
which were very much below than what was mandated by the law.  They 
likewise argued that the company failed to prove compliance with the 
decree and the letter of instruction.
</p><p>
Respondent company, on the other hand, countered that Office Order No. 74-74 was for dual purpose, <em>first</em>:  to incorporate in the basic pay of the employees the emergency cost of living allowance, and <em>second</em>:
  to implement a merit increase to deserving employees in accordance 
with the recommendation of the respective department heads; that the 
incorporation of the emergency cost of living allowance is legal and 
proper since the Rules and Regulations Implementing PD 525 will yield 
the explicit, unmistakable and unequivocal intent of the lawmaker not to
 prohibit employers from incorporating into the basic pay the said 
allowance; that by the very nature of a merit increase, not all 
employees will get an increase because employees have varying competence
 and efficiency in their jobs and that it is highly incredible that the 
company will just simply cancel the allowance without incorporating the 
same in the basic pay, thereby courting criminal prosecution under the 
decree.
</p><p>
We find for the petitioners.
</p><p>
It is worth mentioning that as early as January 4, 1974, the President 
in his speech at the inauguration of the Central Bank Building, issued 
an appeal to employers in the private sector to adopt measures to 
augment the earnings of low-income workers who were greatly affected due
 to the increases in prices of prime commodities.  Such appeal was 
reiterated by the President when he issued PD No. 390 granting emergency
 allowances to government employees where he stressed that there is need
 to alleviate the plight of low wage earners to meet the impact of the 
rising prices of commodities.
</p><p>
There is no dispute that the emergency cost of living allowance was 
granted to petitioners but for only a short period of time and it was 
cancelled by virtue of Office Order No. 74-74.  It was claimed by 
respondent company that the allowance was incorporated into the basic 
salary of the employees and such incorporation is sanctioned by law.  
The NLRC heavily relied on the statement made by respondent company that
 the allowance was incorporated into the basic salary of the employees<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  although there is no showing that such incorporation was actually 
made.  Petitioners have no access to the records and documents of the 
company, hence, the burden lies on the latter to prove compliance with 
the decree.  We do not question the propriety of incorporating the 
allowance into the basic pay for that is not the issue at bar and 
besides, the incorporation is allowed by law.
</p><p>
Workers who belong to the low-income group should be amply protected by 
law from abuses committed by their employers.  The maxim "Those who have
 less in life should have more in law" clearly applies to herein 
petitioners.  Respondent company tried to circumvent the decree in the 
guise of salary adjustment and increases.  Further, LOI 174 provides for
 certain guidelines in the implementation of the grant of the emergency 
cost of living allowance.  Provision No. 7 of said LOI 174 allowed the 
crediting of the benefits to the employees as emergency allowance as 
long as they substantially conform with the guidelines set forth.  
Respondent company is capitalized at more than P1 million and under 
provision No. 3 of LOI 174, the emergency allowance recommended was 
P50.00 each.  The salary increases made ranged from P0.25 a day to 
P/50.00 a month.  As a whole, there was no substantial compliance with 
the provision.  We also note that out of the 165 employers, only 42 were
 given increases.  Such increases may not be credited as emergency cost 
of living allowance.  Sec. 6 of the Interpretative Bulletin on LOI No. 
174 specifically provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> " SEC. 6.  Allowances under LOI.  – All allowances, bonuses, wage 
adjustments and other benefits given by employers to their employees 
shall be treated by the Department of Labor as in substantial compliance
 with the minimum standards set forth in LOI No. 174 if: </p>
  <p> (a)  they conform with at least the minimum allowances scales specified in the immediately preceding Section.  x x x”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The "immediately preceding section" referred to states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 5.  Determination of Amount of Allowances.  - In determining
 the amount of allowances that should be given by employers to meet the 
recommended minimum standards, the LOl has classified employers into 
three general categories.  As an implementation policy, the Department 
of Labor shall consider as sufficient compliance with the scales of 
allowances recommended by the LOI if the following monthly allowances 
are given by employers: </p>
  <p> (a)   P50.00 or higher where the authorized capital stock of the 
corporation, or the total assets in the case of other undertakings, 
exceeds P1 million."
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    x x x
  </p>
  <p>
    Evidently, respondent company failed to show compliance with the 
decree and this being so, an affirmance of the assailed decision and 
resolution is not warranted.  Time and again, the Court has upheld the 
constitutional mandate of protection to labor and therefore, employers 
who are more in an advantageous position than their employees, should be
 more compassionate to their worker's need for without them, businesses 
would cease to operate.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The findings of the NLRC are binding with the Court only if said 
findings are supported by substantial evidence.  Such a circumstance is 
not obtaining in this case hence, the relief prayed for by petitioners 
must be granted.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the resolution dated March 10, 1978 of the Minister of 
Labor and the decision dated December 23, 1976 of the NLRC are hereby 
SET ASIDE.  No Costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos</em>, and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino</em>, J., concurred.  The employer should pay the petitioners mandated in LOI No. 174.
