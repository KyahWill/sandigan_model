				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>VITUG, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This appeal is interposed from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XLIX, in Criminal Case No. 87-58720-SCC convicting the accused thusly:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding the Accused PAULINO RIVERA y ORDANZA guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as principal, for the crime of FORCIBLE ABDUCTION WITH RAPE and hereby imposes on him the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and hereby condemns him to pay to ALMIDA (AILEEN) PORTONA and her parents the amount of P30,000.00 as and by way of moral damages and the costs of suit.<br><br>"The period during which the Accused underwent detention during the pendency of this case shall be credited to him in full provided that he agreed, in writing, to abide by and comply strictly with the rules and regulations of the City Jail.<br><br>"SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>The appellant was charged, on 02 November 1987, with forcible abduction with rape in a complaint filed by the victim, Almida Fortuna, which read:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about October 24, 1987, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together with others whose true names, identities and present whereabouts are still unknown and helping one another, with lewd designs, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously abduct, take and carry away from Cristobal Street, Punta, Sta. Ana, in said City, the undersigned complainant by means of force, violence and intimidation, to wit: by poking a knife at her and covering her mouth and forcibly bringing her into the grassy area at the back of a high concrete fence of EXON Chemicals, Inc., near the bank of Pasig River at Punta, Sta. Ana, this City, where the said accused together with his co-conspirators, by means of force, violence and intimidation, that is, by covering her mouth, holding her arms and legs and pointing a knife at her chest, succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her, against her will.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><br>When arraigned on 17 November 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> appellant pleaded "not guilty" to the crime charged.<br><br>The evidence for the prosecution consists, by and large, of the detailed testimony of the victim herself.<br><br>Almida Fortuna y Muscosa, also known as Aileen, was a 17-year-old housemaid of the spouses Jose and Esperanza Almirante who owned a small store in No. 2958 A. Bautista Street, Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila, where they resided. The daughter of Alberto and Alfita Fortuna of Catbalogan, Samar, Aileen was only five feet and one inch tall and a mere fifth grader in the elementary school when she already had to work for a living.<br><br>On 24 October 1987, at about nine o'clock in the evening, Aileen was asked to buy a case each of beer and "Coca-Cola" from the store owned by a certain Dodong along Cristobal Street.&nbsp; Aileen had gone to the store of Dodong twice before without any untoward incident.&nbsp; Aileen boarded a jeepney bound for Calahig and alighted at the junction of Cristobal and Bautista streets.&nbsp; A male co-passenger also alighted and walked alongside Aileen<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> towards Dodong's store.&nbsp; The place was a residential area.&nbsp; A church stood at the corner of Cristobal and Bautista streets.&nbsp; Just as Aileen had walked past the church, her male co-passenger suddenly darted from behind, held her hands, covered her mouth,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and dragged her towards a small alley where the abductor hailed another man.&nbsp; The two brought Aileen to Obrero Street, some fifty meters away from Dodong's store.&nbsp; She was shoved on board a passenger jeepney, with four other men, parked in front of appellant's house.&nbsp; One of the men blew smoke on the face of Aileen that instantly made here feel dizzy. Since she continued to struggle, the others held her by the hand and covered her mouth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> After a while, Aileen was brought down and dragged to a grassy area beside a dike about two meters away from the fence of Exxon Chemicals, Inc.&nbsp; The place was illuminated by two light bulbs, a hundred watts each, atop a concrete fence.&nbsp; There were no houses in the vicinity.&nbsp; Upon reaching the dike, Aileen was pulled to the ground by four men. One of the malefactors pointed a six-inch knife to her breast.&nbsp; Appellant was then standing just about a meter away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The men helped each other in undressing the struggling Aileen. They succeeded in taking off her t-shirt, "bra," jogging pants, shorts and panty.&nbsp; Her t-shirt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> was torn at its back by approximately eleven inches and at the right armpit by four inches. Her pair of corduroy shorts<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> was ripped by about eight inches in the area adjoining the legs while her jogging pants<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> was torn by one foot below the right hip.&nbsp; With her legs held apart, her hands raised to the level of her head and her mouth covered, one of the men mounted her and had sexual intercourse with her for about two minutes.&nbsp; Aileen cried out but did not lose consciousness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Appellant then took his turn, went astride Aileen and had sexual intercourse with her which lasted for about four minutes.&nbsp; All that she could do was to stare in pain at her aggressor.&nbsp; Aileen could recognize him on account of the bright light.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>There was, suddenly, a heavy downpour which sent appellant and the rest of the group scampering away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Aileen immediately dressed herself up and ran towards the direction of the road. In this plight, she was seen by Joel Calma and by a barangay tanod.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Aileen could not get a ride home because of the heavy downpour.&nbsp; She stayed on board a parked jeepney until about five o'clock in the morning when she proceeded to the church.&nbsp; Here, Dodong chanced upon her.&nbsp; After being told about what had happened, Dodong "phoned" the Almirantes who promptly fetched her.<br><br>Late that afternoon of 25 October 1987, Aileen, accompanied by Pat. Joselito Almirante, a son of her household employers, went to the Punta police detachment where she officially reported the incident.&nbsp; Aileen so described as best she could the persons who assaulted her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> On 27 October 1987, she was brought by the police to the house of Mrs. Teofila Munar, the barangay captain of Barangay 898, Zone 100, of Sta. Ana.&nbsp; Aileen saw a group of persons standing near the gate of the house but she did not notice appellant to be among them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> When Aileen mentioned the name of Joel Calma to Mrs. Munar, the latter summoned Joel. Questioned on the identity of the persons who raped Aileen, Joel named them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Later, Aileen was brought to Dr. Prospero A. Cabanayan, medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation, for medical examination. In his report,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Dr. Cabanayan stated that (1) there was no evident sign of extragenital physical injury on Aileen's body, and (2) there were healed deep hymenal lacerations at "3:00 o'clock and 8:00 o'clock positions in her sex organ."<br><br>On the basis of the information given to them by Joel Calma, the police picked up appellant at his residence in the early morning of 01 November 1987.&nbsp; At about five o'clock that afternoon, appellant was brought to Police Station No. 6 from the Punta police detachment.&nbsp; They dropped by at the house of the Almirantes.&nbsp; When Aileen saw appellant, Aileen, trembling in anger, tried to approach appellant but she was stopped.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The group then proceeded to Police Station No. 6, where Aileen executed her sworn statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Earlier in the day, at about eleven o'clock in the morning, Carlito Rosario, head of the barangay where the Almirantes resided, went to see Pat. Joselito Almirante to intercede for appellant who, it turned out, was the husband of Rosario's niece.&nbsp; Appellant's mother, Epifania, and his brother, Rodelio, also approached the Almirantes in an effort to settle the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Appellant was formally booked on 02 November 1987, with no bail recommended for his release, and charged in court the following day.<br><br>In his defense, appellant, a 28-year-old high school graduate and a contract worker in Saudi Arabia from 1980 until his last trip back to the country on 18 August 1987, vehemently denied any participation in the crime.&nbsp; According to him, at around ten o'clock in the evening of 24 October 1987, he was at home viewing a television program.&nbsp; He stepped out of the house only for a moment to converse with his neighbor, Joel Calma, who happened to drop by.&nbsp; The two were later advised by the barangay captain, Teofila Munar, to stay indoor since the police were expected to then shortly conduct a "saturation drive." Appellant went back to watching television until he went upstairs to join his sleeping children.<br><br>Continuing with his narration, appellant said that, on 25 October 1987 he did not leave the house except to attend the Sunday mass with his children.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The following day, he left but only to conduct his two sons to school.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On 27 October 1987, he went to the Manila Resources Agency to apply for employment abroad but was already back home at about two o'clock in the afternoon. By the gate of their house and in the company of Joel Calma and two other friends, he saw an owner-type jeep parked beside the house of Mrs. Teofila Munar.&nbsp; Patrolmen Machon and Nombrado, one police aide and two female companions alighted from the vehicle and entered Mrs. Munar's house.&nbsp; Joel was summoned by Mrs. Munar.&nbsp; Curious, appellant followed Joel to Mrs. Munar's house. Joel was asked whether he knew the men who were responsible for raping Aileen but Joel answered in the negative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In the morning of 01 November 1987, appellant said, he was invited by the police to the Punta Police detachment.&nbsp; Appellant asked for a warrant of arrest but the policemen assured him that he was merely being invited for questioning.&nbsp; Appellant requested his mother to fetch the barangay captain and to follow him to the police detachment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> At the detachment, appellant was informed that he was a suspect in the rape case. He was detained from six o'clock in the morning to five o'clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; Appellant, maintained his innocence and turned down overtures by the police to "settle" the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Later, however, he relented and tried to seek a settlement explaining that the Arabian government had meantime given him a re-entry visa within six months or until 09 February 1988.&nbsp; No settlement materialized due principally to his brother, Teodorico Rivera, being also arrested on 22 January 1988 on suspicion that the latter was among those involved in the rape case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>In the afternoon of the day of his arrest, appellant was brought to the Almirante residence.&nbsp; Aileen, appellant admitted, had so pointed to him as the culprit but it was only after Joselito Almirante had nodded his head to Aileen.&nbsp; The group proceeded to the police station to execute their respective sworn statements,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> including those of Mrs. Munar and Joel Calma.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>On the supposed sudden downpour testified to by Aileen, the defense presented a certification from the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Administration ("PAGASA") to the effect that while Typhoon Pepang was within the Philippine area of responsibility from 21 to 25 October 1987, no rainfall was recorded between nine in the evening and midnight of 24 October 1987 by the Science Garden Weather Station in Quezon City and the MIA Weather Station in Pasay which covered Punta, Sta. Ana, although there was a cloudy sky with light southwesterly to variable winds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Recalled to the witness stand, Dr. Cabanayan testified that the sexual assault upon Aileen could not have been consummated on 24 October 1987 since her hymen had "healed" lacerations with sharp and coaptable edges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Dr. Cabanayan conceded, however, that a sharp laceration is indicative of an early stage of healing and that the period of healing may vary depending on the way the woman takes care of her body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>On 02 January 1989, the trial court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> convinced by the case for the prosecution and undaunted by the evidence for the defense, rendered its decision convicting the accused of the crime charged and sentencing him accordingly.<br><br>In this appeal, accused-appellant questions the legality of his arrest, the denial of his right to counsel during custodial investigation, the manner and method of his identification and, not the least, his conviction on the sole testimony of the complainant.<br><br>Appellant contends that the trial court should have declared his arrest illegal for having been made without a proper warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> Unfortunately, this issue is a matter that should have been seasonably raised by appellant before the trial court.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Codilla</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> the Court has held:<br><br><blockquote>"This appellant starts his defense by challenging his warrantless arrest and detention for two days without any charges being filed against him.&nbsp; We have of necessity to reject this argument for the simple reason that he is estopped from questioning the legality of his arrest.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Any objection involving a warrant of arrest or the procedure in the acquisition by the court of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before he enters his plea, otherwise the objection is deemed waived.</span>&nbsp; Besides, this issue is being raised for the first time by appellant before this Court.&nbsp; He did not move for the quashal of the information before the trial on this ground. Hence, any irregularity attendant to his arrest, if any, was cured when he voluntarily submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the trial court by entering a plea of not guilty and participating in the trial." (Italics supplied.)</blockquote><br>Appellant's plea of "not guilty" when arraigned and his participation at the trial without timely questioning the legality of his arrest forecloses any further ventilation in this appeal of the issue.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Appellant claims to have been deprived of his right to counsel during custodial investigation.&nbsp; Appellant appears to have executed a sworn statement ("<span style="font-style: italic;">sinumpaang salaysay</span>") before Pfc. Arturo A. Cortes at Precinct No. 6 of the Western Police District at around eleven o'clock in the evening of 01 November 1995,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> after being apprised of his right to remain silent, right to counsel of his own choice and right against self-incrimination.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Galit,</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> we did rule that any statement, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, taken from the accused during custodial investigation must be made with the assistance of counsel, and such statement, including a waiver of the right to counsel, made without the presence of counsel, shall be inadmissible in evidence. That right to counsel attaches from the moment the investigation starts, i.e., when the investigating officer begins to ask questions to elicit information and confessions or admissions from the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> In the recent case of <span style="font-style: italic;">People v. Lucero</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> we have reiterated:<br><br><blockquote>"The 1987 Constitution requires that a person under investigation for the commission of a crime should be provided with counsel.&nbsp; We have constitutionalized the right to counsel because of our hostility against the use of duress and other undue influence in extracting confessions from a suspect.&nbsp; Force and fraud tarnish confessions and render them inadmissible.&nbsp; We take pride in constitutionalizing this right to counsel even while other countries have desisted from elevating this right to a higher pedestal.&nbsp; We have sustained the inviolability of this precious right with vigor and without any apology."</blockquote><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Galit</span>, however, itself recognizes the sustention of conviction as long as there still remains sufficient evidence therefor.&nbsp; Such is the case in this instance.&nbsp; Indeed, appellant's sworn statement has been offered in evidence by the defense as Exhibit 3 and, obviously, it did not serve as the basis for conviction.&nbsp; It is long settled that the testimony of a sole eyewitness, if credible and positive, is sufficient to convict an accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> This principle applies with greater force, than elsewhere, in rape cases where ordinarily the victim herself becomes the main witness for the prosecution.&nbsp; If her testimony is simple and straightforward, unshaken by a rigid cross-examination, the same must be given faith and credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>Going over the transcript of stenographic notes ourselves, we see no cogent reason to ignore the favorable assessment made by the trial court on Aileen's testimony.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br><blockquote>"COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Upon alighting from the jeep what happened?<br></div><br>"WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">When I alighted the jeep there was also a man alighting the jeep, and when I walked, that person went with me and then when I was near the store that person covered my mouth, sir.<br></div><br>"COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">What store are you referring to?<br></div><br>"WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">It is a big store, sir.<br></div><br>"COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Are you referring to that place wherein you called 'Calahig'?<br></div><br>"WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes, sir.<br></div><br>"COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Proceed.<br></div><br>"FISCAL CADELINA:&nbsp;
