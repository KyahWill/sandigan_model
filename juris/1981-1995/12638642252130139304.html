the victim being held by the two brothers, accused and Junior <span class="SpellE">Solares</span> (accused was holding the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined the records and we find no reason to
discredit the trial court's appreciation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
the evidence of the prosecution and that of the defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is of no moment that the prosecution presented a lone eyewitness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If her uncorroborated testimony is credible
and positive, and satisfies the court beyond reasonable doubt then it is
sufficient to justify con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">viction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Ibal</span>, 143 SCRA 317 (1986)).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave credence to the positive identification made
by prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>

probable, and her credibility <span class="GramE">was</span> not in any manner
shaken by cross-examination to which she had been exposed." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 17).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant tries to cast some doubt on <span class="SpellE">Cunanan's</span>
testimony by pointing to the fact that she was summoned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">This was satisfactorily explained as the appellant was

really impugn the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Solares</span> cites the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> wherein she stated that the appellant was holding
the right arm of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the victim <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> Mercado and Junior <span class="SpellE">Solares</span>

  13.0pt">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> repeatedly stabbed Mercado.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since that was his only participation in the crime, he contends that he
cannot be convicted of murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The presence of
conspiracy was clearly established in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assailants were animated by one and the
same purpose - that is to inflict harm on Mercado.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Manlolo</span>, G.R. No. 40778, January 26, 1989).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The question as to who actually
stabbed Mercado, therefore, becomes of no consequence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that in conspiracy, the act of
one is the act of all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The appellant also questions the finding of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">presence of treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends that the attack on the victim was
frontal; as such the victim was not completely deprived of his prerogative to
defend himself </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to retaliate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the victim was completely help<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hands were held by the attackers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the accused held the victim's right
arm with both of his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were
five people including <span class="SpellE">Solares</span> who were ganging up on
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As held in the case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Gimongala</span></u>,

<blockquote>"We sustain the finding of treachery against them as it is
clear that they had adopted means and methods to insure the commission of the
offenses without risk to themselves from any defense their unwary victims might
make.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears stressing that their
victims were totally unprepared for their sudden attack and also without any
weapons to resist it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the appellant alleges that he and the victim were good
friends so he had no motive in wanting him killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of improper motive on the part of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accused and the raising of the defense of
alibi that the appellant was asleep at the time of the killing in his house in
the same neighborhood cannot prevail over the straightforward narration of the
prosecution eyewitness, more so as no ill motive was attributed to the latter
to prevaricate the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. Trinidad, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">G.R.
