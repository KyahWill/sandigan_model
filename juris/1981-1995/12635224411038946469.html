This petition for review concerns a "subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>" 
which was issued by the trial court against the treasurer of the herein 
petitioner, the propriety of which was upheld by the defunct Court of 
Appeals (now Intermediate Appellate Court).
<p>
The facts of this case as stated in the decision of the then Court of Appeals are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Records disclose that the two respondent corporations herein sued
 the present petitioner before the Court of First Instance of Rizal for 
unfair competition with damages and attorney's fees. In due time herein 
petitioner, who was the defendant in that court suit, answered the 
complaint and joined issues with the plaintiffs therein, forthwith 
respondent Judge, to whom that lawsuit was assigned, proceeded with the 
trial thereof. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After they have presented about nine witnesses and various pieces of 
documentary evidence, herein private respondents made a request to the 
respondent Judge to issue a subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> against the treasu­rer of herein petitioner. Acting favorably on that request, said respondent Judge issued a subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>
 on February 13, 1968, directing the treasurer of the present petitioner
 to bring with him to the lower court on February 26, 1968 and March 8, 
1968 at 2:30 p.m. 'all sales invoices, sales books and ledgers wherein 
are recorded the sales of Plymouth Star Player rubber shoes from the 
time the corporation started manufacturing and selling said shoes up to 
the present.'
</p><p>
On March 4, 1968, petitioner filed a motion in the court below praying that the subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>
 dated February 13, 1968 be quashed on the grounds that: (1) the said 
subpoena is both unreasonable and oppressive as the books and documents 
called for are numerous and voluminous; (2) there is no good cause shown
 for the issuance thereof; and (3) the books and documents are not 
relevant to the case pending below. The private respondents herein 
opposed that motion of the petitioner. Acting on the said motion and on 
the opposition thereto, respondent Judge issued the first controverted 
order on May 6, 1968, denying the motion to quash the subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>.
</p><p>
On May 15, 1968, herein petitioner filed in the court a quo a motion for
 reconsideration seeking the said court to reconsider its order denying 
the motion to quash the subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>. This, too, was 
opposed by the private respondents. Acting on this motion, as well as on
 the opposition thereto, respondent Judge issued the second controverted
 order on June 28, 1968, denying the motion for reconsideration.
</p><p>
Consequently, on August 6, 1968, petitioner Universal Rubber Products, Inc. filed its present petition for <em>certiorari </em>with preliminary injunction, alleging that in so denying its motion to quash the subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>
 and its subsequent motion for reconsideration, respondent Judge acted 
with grave abuse of discretion amounting to an excess of jurisdiction."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
Pending the resolution of the appealed case, the Court of Appeals issued
 on September 25, 1968 a temporary restraining order directing the 
respondent Judge of the trial court to refrain from implementing his 
order dated May 6, 1968 in Civil Case No. 9686.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
On November 12, 1966, the respondent Court rendered its decision denying the petition for <em>certiorari </em>filed by petitioner for lack of merit. The dispositive portion of the said decision reads:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, for lack of merit, the present petition for <em>certiorari </em>with
 preliminary injunction is hereby denied and the temporary restraining 
order issued by this Court on September 25, 1968 is now lifted, with 
costs against the petitioner. </p>
  <p> SO ORDERED."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner argues three errors to support his petition, to wit:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center"> "I. </p>
  <p>
    The respondent court erred when it found the fact of the petition 
and its annexes as not demonstrating clear abuse of discretion by 
respondent Judge.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    II.
  </p>
  <p>
    The respondent court erred when it refused to sustain the contention
 of petitioner that the issuance by the respondent judge of the subpoena
 <em>duces tecum</em> was an arbitrary exercise of judicial power.
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    III.
  </p>
  <p> The respondent court erred when it did not consider the subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> issued by the respondent judge as a fishing bill when it refused to order its quashal."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The issues summarized, We are called upon to answer whether the issuance of the "subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>" is proper in a suit for unfair competition.
</p><p>
Private respondent claims the affirmative because (1) the subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>
 in question specifically designates the books and documents that should
 be produced in court and they are "sales invoices, sales books and 
ledgers where are recorded the sales of Plymouth Star Player Rubber 
Shoes from the time the corporation started manufacturing and selling 
shoes (that is from April 1, 1963) up to the present; and (2) the 
relevancy of the books subject to the controverted subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>
 cannot be seriously denied, because if and when herein respondent 
corporations are ultimately adjudged to be entitled to recover 
compensatory damages from the petitioner, there would be no factual 
basis for the amount of such damages unless those books and documents 
are laid open for the court's scrutiny.
</p><p>
On the other hand, petitioner submits a contrary opinion and insists 
that the question of liability of petitioner should be determined first 
before discovery by means of a subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> is allowed;
 that respondent Converse is a foreign corporation not licensed to do 
business in the Philippines and that Edwardson is merely its licensee 
that respondent Converse has no good­will to speak of and that it has no
 registrable right over its own names; that the questioned subpoena <em>duces tecum</em> issued by respondent judge was merely a "Fishing Bill."
</p><p>
In the meantime, while this present petition remains pending before this Court, petitioner manifested on April 2, 1977<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  that their establishment was totally burned together with all the 
records which is sought to be produced in court by the questioned 
"subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>" on May 3, 1970. In effect, it renders 
the present petition moot and academic. However, the legal principles 
arising from the issues deserve Our discussion and resolution.
</p><p>
As a general rule, on obtaining an injunction for infringement of a 
trademark, complainant is entitled to an accounting and recovery of 
defendant's profits on the goods sold under that mark, as incident to, 
and a part of, his property right, and this rule applies in cases of 
unfair competition. In such case, the infringer or unfair trader is 
required in equity to account for and yield up his gains on a principle 
analogous to that which charges as trustee with the profits acquired by 
the wrongful use of the property of the cestui que trust, and 
defendant's profits are regarded as an equitable measure of the 
compensation plaintiff should receive for the past harm suffered by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
Well-settled is Our jurisprudence that, in order to entitle a party to the issuance of a "subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>",
 it must appear, by clear and unequivocal proof, that the book or 
document sought to be produced contains evidence relevant and material 
to the issue before the court, and that the precise book, paper or 
document containing such evidence has been so designated or described 
that it may be identified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  A "subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>"
 once issued by the court may be quashed upon motion if the issuance 
thereof is unreasonable and oppressive, or the relevancy of the books, 
documents or things does not appear, or if the persons in whose behalf 
the subpoena is issued fails to advance the reasonable cost of 
production thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
In the instant case, in determining whether the books subject to the subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>
 are relevant and reasonable in relation to the complaint of private 
respondent for unfair competition, We have to examine Republic Act No. 
166,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "CHAPTER V. -- Rights and Remedies </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span style="">xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</span></p>
  <p>
    Sec. 23. Actions, and damages and injunction for infringement. - Any
 person entitled to the exclusive use of a registered mark or trade name
 may recover damages in a civil action from any person who infringes his
 rights and the measure of the damages suffered shall be either the 
reasonable profit which the complaining party would have made, had the 
defendant not infringed his said rights, or the profit which the 
defendant actually made out of the infringement, or in the event such 
measure of damages cannot be readily ascertained with reasonable 
certainty, then the court may award as damages a reasonable percentage 
based upon the amount of gross sales of the defendant of the value of 
the services in connection with which the mark or trade name was used in
 the infringement of the rights of the complaining party. In cases where
 actual intent to mislead the public or to defraud the complaining party
 shall be shown in the discretion of the court, the damages may be 
doubled.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The complaining party, upon proper showing may also be granted injunction."
</p><p>
In recovering the loss suffered by the aggrieved party due to "unfair 
competition", Sec. 23 of R.A. 166 grants the complainant three options 
within which to ascertain the amount of damages recoverable, either (1) 
the reasonable profit which the complaining party would have made, had 
the defendant not infringed his said rights; or (2) the profit which the
 defendant actually made out of the infringement; or (3) the court may 
award as damages a reasonable percentage based upon the amount of gross 
sales of the defendant of the value of the services in connection with 
which the mark or tradename was issued in the infringement of the rights
 of the complaining party.
</p><p>
In giving life to this remedial statute, We must uphold the order of the
 court a quo denying the motion of the petitioner to quash the "subpoena
 <em>duces tecum</em>" previously issued against the petitioner. In a 
suit for unfair competition, it is only through the issuance of the 
questioned "subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>" that the complaining party is afforded his full rights of redress.
</p><p>
The argument that the petitioner should first be found guilty of unfair 
competition before an accounting for purposes of ascertaining the amount
 of damages recoverable can proceed, stands without merit. The complaint
 for unfair competition is basically a suit for "injunction and 
damages".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  Injunction, for
 the purpose of enjoining the unlawful competitor from proceeding 
further with the unlawful competition, and damages, in order to allow 
the aggrieved party to recover the damage he has suffered by virtue of 
the said unlawful competition. Hence, the election of the complainant 
(private respondent herein) for the accounting of petitioner's 
(defendant below) gross sales as damages per R.A. 166, appears most 
relevant. For Us, to determine the amount of damages allowable after the
 final determination of the unfair labor case would not only render 
nugatory the rights of complainant under Sec. 23 of R.A. 166, but would 
be a repetitious process causing only unnecessary delay.
</p><p>
The sufficiency in the description of the books sought to be produced in court by the questioned "subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>" is not disputed in this case, hence, We hold that the same has passed the test of sufficient description.
</p><p>
Petitioner also assails that private respondent is a foreign corporation
 not licensed to do business in the Philippines and that respondent 
Edwardson is merely its licensee; that respondent Converse has no 
goodwill to speak of and that it has no registrable right over its own 
name. We have already answered this issue squarely in Our decision of 
the case of Converse Rubber Corporation, <em>vs.</em> Jacinto Rubber &amp; Plastic Co., Inc.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  where We explained:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The disability of a foreign corporation from suing in the 
Philippines is limited to suits to enforce any legal or contract rights 
arising from, or growing out, of any business which it has transacted in
 the Philippine Island. x x x On the other hand, where the purpose of a 
suit is 'to protect its reputation, its corporate name, its goodwill, 
whenever that reputation, corporate name or good­will have, through the 
natural development of its trade, established themselves', an unlicensed
 foreign corporation may sue in the Philippines. So interpreted by the 
Supreme Court, it is clear that Sec­tion 29 of the Corporation Law does 
not disqualify plaintiff-appellee Converse Rubber, which does not have a
 branch office in any part of the Philippines and is not 'doing 
business' in the Philippines, from filing and prosecuting this action 
for unfair competition."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As We said earlier, the establishment of the petitioner burned down 
together with all the records sought to be produced by the questioned 
"subpoena <em>duces tecum</em>", hence this case has become moot and academic. We have no recourse but to dismiss the same.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the instant petition is DISMISSED for becoming moot and academic. No costs.
SO ORDERED.
