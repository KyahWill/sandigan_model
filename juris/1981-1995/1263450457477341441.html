				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the exemption of an alleged financially
distressed corporation from the payment of the emergency allowance and the
thirteenth month pay required in Presidential Decrees Nos. 525 and 851,
respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is a footwear manufacturer with an office at <st1:street><st1:address>14
  M. H. del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Calumpang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="GramE">Metro</span> Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was incorporated on <st1:date month="7" day="9" year="1975">July 9,
 1975</st1:date> by the spouses Felipe R. <span class="SpellE">Veneracion</span>
and Andrea O. <span class="SpellE">Veneracion</span>, the spouses <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> B. Ignacio and <span class="SpellE">Perla</span> M.
Ignacio, and <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> E. Rivera, Jr. (Annex 8 of <span class="SpellE">NLU's</span> Comment).</p>

<p class="BODY">Its authorized capital was P300<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had a subscribed capital of P60<span class="GramE">,000</span> and a paid-up capital of P25,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annex 8 of <span class="SpellE">NLU's</span>
Comment).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="12" day="15" year="1977">December 15, 1977</st1:date>, the Central Bank certified
that the petitioner was an export-oriented firm (p. 1, Comment and Memo of
Solicitor General).</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioner, the Wage Commission found it to be a
"distressed" corporation which sustained losses amounting to P208,270
as of December 31, 1976, thus supposedly impairing its paid-up capital by
73.07% (pp. 4 and 62, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a final and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span> decision
dated <st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1977">November 24, 1977</st1:date>,
Acting Secretary of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> approved petitioner's application for exemption
from the obligation to pay the <u>additional cost-of-living allowance</u>
(amounting to sixty pesos) prescribed in Presidential Decree No. 1123.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exemption was effective for the one-year
period starting on <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1977</st1:date>,
when that decree took effect (Annex 3 of <span class="GramE">NLU' s</span>
Comment).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 7 (not 19), 1977, the National Labor Union, allegedly
in representation of its 152 members, filed with Manila Region IV of the
Department of Labor a complaint against the petitioner for nonpayment of the
emergency and additional cost-of-living allowances and the thirteenth month
pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing and the filing of position papers, the regional
director issued an order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="10">October
 23, 1978</st1:date>, directing the petitioner or employer to pay the total sum
of P162<span class="GramE">,552.25</span> as emergency allowance and thirteenth
month pay of the 152 workers listed therein (Annex B of Petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">In that order, the emergency allowance was computed up to <u>April,
1977</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director noted that, while
the petitioner was exempted from paying the additional cost-of-living allowance
<span style="">under Presidential Decree No. 1123
because it was a "distressed employer", it would not follow that it
should be exempted from the payment of the emergency allowance and the
thirteenth month pay since it did not apply for such exemption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That order of the director was affirmed by the Minister of Labor
through his Deputy Minister in his order of <st1:date month="2" day="5" year="1979">February 5, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Deputy Minister in another order dated <st1:date month="5" day="10" year="1979">May 10, 1979</st1:date> denied petitioner's motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The execution of the award for P162<span class="GramE">,552.25</span>
was stayed when the petitioner posted a surety bond for that amount executed by
Zenith Insurance Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">A few days later, or on May 18, the petitioner filed this special
civil action of <i>certiorari</i> for the purpose of annulling the regional
director's decision, as affirmed by the Deputy Minister of Labor, requiring the
petitioner to pay P162<span class="GramE">,552.25</span> as thirteenth month pay
and emergency allowance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this <span class="GramE">Court' s</span> resolution of <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1980</st1:date>, the director
recomputed the total amount allegedly due from the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount was reduced to <u>P128, 979.51</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">That reduction is an indication that this case was not thoroughly
threshed out by the administrative agencies concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not all the factual issues raised by the
parties had been squarely resolved.</p>

<blockquote>1. The regional director and the Minister of Labor failed to
resolve the issue of whether respondent National Labor Union has the authority to
represent the one hundred fifty claimants in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the certification of the Labor
Organizations Division of the Bureau of Labor Relations the said union
"has no chapter at <span class="SpellE">Baranga</span> Manufacturing &amp;
Export Corporation".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has a
chapter at the <span class="SpellE"><u>Baranga</u></span><u> Enterprises,</u> an
entity distinct from <span style="">the petitioner and
with which it has allegedly no connection at all (p. 101, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, thirty-two claimants in their letter of <st1:date month="5" day="7" year="1979">May 7, 1979</st1:date> to the petitioner alleged
that they did not authorize the said union to file claims in their behalf (p.
102, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the union counters that the 150 claimants
filed applications for membership with the said union and, therefore, it is
their legitimate representative.</p>

<p class="BODY">To resolve that issue, the 150 claimants, if unable to appear and
testify, should at least submit to the regional director their affidavits as to
(a) their personal circumstances, (b) the period when they worked for the
petitioner, (c) the amounts which they received as compensation and (d) whether
they are members of the union and have authorized it to file claims for the
emergency allowance and the thirteenth month pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner in a pleading filed with the Ministry of Labor
manifested that it would submit "a detailed refutation of the findings of
the Director with respect to each employee concerned" (p. 62, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<blockquote>2. The other issue is whether the petitioner is a distressed
corporation and as such should be exempted from the payment of the emergency
allowance and the thirteenth month pay during the years 1975, 1976 and 1977.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner insists that it is entitled to the exemption under
the proviso of section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 525.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General contends that the
exemption was abolished by Presidential Decree No. 1364 dated <st1:date month="5" day="1" year="1978">May 1, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">That issue should be directly resolved by the regional director
and the Ministry of Labor and Employment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the interest of justice, the enforceÂ­ment of
the recomputed allowance is <u>suspended</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This case is remanded to the director of Region 4 (now National Capital
Region) of the Ministry of Labor and Employment for a <u>rehearing</u> on the
above-mentioned factual issues and, after such hearing, to render the
appropriate decision, affirming, modifying or setting aside the recomputed
award.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
