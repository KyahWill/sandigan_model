of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, Branch II, in Criminal Case No.
R-57, convicting the accused <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardiniano</span>, his son <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardiniano</span>, and his son-in-law Rodolfo Ortega, of Murder,

<p class="BODY">The victim, <span class="SpellE">Balud</span>, a 60-year old <span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span>, <span style="">was </span>killed
on the night of February 11, 1970 at around 10;00 o'clock outside his house at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Siangi</span>, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lisap</span>, in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Bongabon,Oriental</span>

autopsy performed by Dr. Fernando A. <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span>,
Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mindoro</span></span><span style="">, revealed that the victim had suffered

declared that the wound could have been caused by the infliction of a blow on
the head with a hard blunt instrument like a piece of wood, causing brain
damage, as indicated by the bleeding of the nose and ears, which resulted in
the death of the victim.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the house, and hit her on the head rendering her <span class="SpellE">unconcious</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she came to, she called her son to untie
her, after which, she lit a light and, with the little boy, went to the house

outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented an altogether different version, Witnesses <span class="SpellE">Balitang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ganid</span>, brother and
nephew, respectively, of the deceased, declared that they, together with <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lugak</span></span><span style="">, </span>another brother of the de­ceased, <span style="">witnessed </span>the whole incident because
they slept that night in the house of <span class="SpellE">Hignay</span>, the
deceased's first wife, to help the deceased in the clearing of his "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>" the following morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stated that it was <span class="SpellE">Anao</span>,
another <span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span>, who killed the deceased because of a
boundary dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Semaco</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manato</span>, former <span style="">Barrio
</span>Councilman of <span class="SpellE">Lisap</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span>
Martinez, Barrio Captain of <span class="SpellE">Lisap</span>, confirmed the
alleged boundary dispute between the deceased and <span class="SpellE">Anao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On their own behalf, the three accused, who are also residents of
<span class="SpellE">Siangi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, individually interposed the defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardiniano</span> alleged that on <st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1970</st1:date>, he went to Barrio Luna, <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>, to repair the roof of the house of his in-laws,
and stayed there up to the fourteenth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His testimony was corroborated by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Salagubang</span>,
who allegedly went to the same barrio on that date to visit his mother-in-law,
who was dying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused Rodolfo Ortega
declared that he went to <span class="SpellE">Masaguisi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>, on <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="2">February
 9, 1970</st1:date> to harvest <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and returned to <span class="SpellE">Siangi</span> only on <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="2">February
 20, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardiniano</span> claimed
that he was in his house at <span class="SpellE">Siangi</span> on the night of
the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He confirmed the
respective testimonies of his son, <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span>, and his
son-in-law, Rodolfo, as to their whereabouts that evening.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial Court gave credence to the version of the prosecution
and, on <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1973</st1:date>,
rendered its Decision with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, accused, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardiniano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardiniano</span>, and Rodolfo Ortega, are hereby found guilty
beyond reason able doubt of the crime of murder as defined and pe­nalized in
Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, quali­fied by treachery-and all the accused
having taken advantage of their superior strength, with all the attendant
aggravating circumstance as enumerated in <span style="">the
information, without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same, conse­quently,
the Court has no alternative but to impose as it hereby imposes upon all the
accused the capital punishment of DEATH.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are likewise condemned to pay jointly and severally the heirs of the
victim, <span class="SpellE">Balud</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span>, the
amount of P12,000.00 as indemnity, with out of course, subsidiary imprisonment
in case of insolvency in view of the nature </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the penalty, and to pay the costs."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
this </span>appeal, appellants maintain that:</p>

<blockquote>"The lower Court erred in holding that appellants were guilty
of murder in the absence of proof beyond reasonable doubt <span style="">as </span><span style="">disclosed </span><span style="">by the facts estab­</span><span style="">lished </span><span style="">by
the evidence on record."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants insist that they have not been positively <span style="">identified </span><span style="">by </span>prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Redoma</span> <span style="">and Win-ay, </span><span style="">their testimonies being filled with inc</span><span style="">onsistencies </span><span style="">and riddled
with self-contradictions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is baseless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Redoma</span> <span style="">pointed </span>categorically to appellant <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardiniano</span> as the one who
forcibly dragged the deceased outside <span style="">his
house and then boxed and clubbed him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Win-ay at­</span><span style="">tributed </span><span style="">the same role to
appellant <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And although Win-ay did not see the other two appellants, they were
specifically identified by <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> and their
respective participation fully described by her - appellant <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
tied the deceased's hands behind his back, while appellant Rodolfo focused his
flash­light on the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even
assuming the existence of a few minor </span><span style="">contradictions </span><span style="">in the
statements of </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">witnesses, they would have no effect on the
probative value of their statements as their decla­rations are consistent in
pointing to the accused as </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">participis</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span> </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the killing of the </span><span style="">victim.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The inconsistencies and contradictions assailed by the defense
are more apparent than real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, they
maintain that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> and Win-ay gave different
versions regarding the utterances made by the deceased when he was being
assaulted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even admitting such in­consistencies,
it is evident that they refer to minor details with respect to which persons
witnessing the same occurrence are bound to disagree in the ordinary course of
events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is usual among witnesses
and will not affect their credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, there is no basis either to the alleged inconsistencies
between <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span> testimony and that of Win-ay as
to the house from where <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> viewed the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span>
stated that she was in the h<span style="">ouse of the
first wife (<span class="SpellE">Hignay</span>) of the deceased when she saw the
three appellants commit the crime for which they were indicted.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Contrary to the defense posture, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> did not say that she was in the house of
Win-ay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Win-ay herself declared that <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> was in <span class="SpellE">Hignay's</span> house
on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="2"><span style="">February 11, 1970</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, their testimonies, are, </span>in
<span style="">fact, consistent with each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> and Win-ay did not
contradict each other regarding the number of persons staying in the deceased's
house when the incident took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> said that there were four persons residing <span style="">in </span>the house
of the deceased <span style="">at </span>the time of the
incident, which is not incorrect, as Win-ay herself stated that she has two
children with the deceased, a boy and a girl.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Win-ay never stated that there were only three people living in their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What she said merely was that her
son <span class="SpellE">Dayao</span> slept with her-and her husband that night.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, relative to the house nearest which the deceased was
killed, considering the minimal three-meter-distance between the house of <span class="SpellE">Hignay</span> from where <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span>
viewed the incident, and the house of Win-ay from where the deceased was
dragged and clubbed to death, it is not really incorrect to state that the
deceased was killed outside <span class="SpellE">Hignay's</span> house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, again, this is but an inconsequential
matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fifthly, appellants, further assail <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia's</span>
credibility because although, on direct, she declared in detail how she saw
appellants kill the deceased, on cross, she stated that the persons she saw
that evening were wearing masks and her only basis for testifying that
appellants killed the deceased was that while she was lying down about to
sleep, she overheard voices which were familiar to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once more, this is inaccurate, because <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> further stated that when she heard the voices,
she got up, went to the stairs, and saw appellants perpetrate the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She recognized the culprits because Rodolfo
trained the flashlight on the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The light provided sufficient illumination to enable her to recognize
all the appellants, whom she had known for <span style="">a </span>long time since they were residents of the same muni­<span style="">cipality.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The overriding issue raised by the defense sim­mers down to the
credibility of prosecution witnesses, with respect to which, this Court has
always accorded the highest degree of respect to the findings of the trial
Judge, unless there is proof of <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span> of
evidence,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>which is absent in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' individual defense of alibi cannot be sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well settled that evidence to support
the same must preclude the possibility of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
presence at the scene of the crime while the evidence relative to his
identification must be weak and insufficient.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
No proof has been shown that it was physically impossible for appellants to
have been at the scene of the incident at the time it occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place where appellants <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> and Rodolfo claimed to be were within the same
munici­pality where the offense was committed although in different
barrios.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence discloses that
passenger vehicles ply those places and appellants could have easily negotiated
the respective distances by taking a motor vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
was in the same <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Siangi</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and it would have been
an easy matter for him to have gone to the deceased's house at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, participated in
killing him, and slipped back to his house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the defense of alibi assumes importance only when the evidence
for the prosecution is weak especially on the aspect of identity of the
culprit.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, positive identification of appellants was furnished by witnesses <span class="SpellE">Eustaqui</span> and Win-ay, sufficient to estab­lish their guilt
to a moral certainty.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the trial Court found, appellants' criminal act was motivated
by their desire to get the land of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased had already given up a sizable
portion of his land to appellant <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>, which
the latter distributed to his fellow Christians, but <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Apolinario</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">wanted to acquire the remaining land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Win-ay declared that appellant <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> got their piece of land at <span class="SpellE">Gantong</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Gandon</span>) and never paid for it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> She was positive that appellants' killed her
husband because they wanted to get the piece of land, on which their house
stood, but the deceased refused to give it to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial Court correctly denied credence to the testimonies of
defense witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Balitang</span>, brother, and <span class="SpellE">Ganid</span>, nephew of the deceased, <span style="">that </span>they saw the latter being clubbed by <span class="SpellE">Anao</span>,
as the trial Court stated;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>". . . if it were true that they,
together with <span class="SpellE">Lugak</span>, who was also the brother of the
de­ceased, were present, by instinct, one of them being<span style=""> also the nephew of the de­ceased and they being armed with bolos as
they were in the vicinity because they would help in the clearing of the <span class="SpellE">kaingin</span> of <span class="SpellE">Balud</span>, they should
have gone to the im­mediate succor of their brother who was in imminent danger,
it appearing that <span class="SpellE">Anao</span> was armed only with a piece of
wood."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Further, contrary to what <span class="SpellE">Ganid</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balitang</span> <span style="">claimed </span>Win-ay declared that the
deceased's land was not yet ready for "<span class="SpellE">kaingin</span>"
so that there would have been no<span style=""> </span><span style="">reason </span><span style="">for <span class="SpellE">Ganid</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balitang</span> to have been at <span class="SpellE">Hignay's</span>,
<span style="">(the </span>first wife's) house on the
night of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And if
they really had been there, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span>, who was in the
house, would have seen them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, in so far as the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Mangyans</span>,
in general, are concerned, the trial Court had this to say:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is a matter of common knowledge that in this province
where the <span class="SpellE">Mangyans</span> belonging to the cultural minority
are residing, their reputation as witness in Court proceedings <span style="">has </span>usually been discarded by the
Court because they are inherently liars; hence, testimony of <span class="SpellE">Balitang</span>, brother and <span class="SpellE">Ganid</span>,
nephew, re­spectively of the deceased, can­not be given also any weight be­cause
whatever they have declared in Court has been overcome by the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquia</span> <span class="SpellE">Radoma</span> and Win-ay <span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span>, surviving <span style="">spouse
</span>of <span class="SpellE">Balud</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span>;
likewise, being unlettered and most of them <span style="">are residing in the mountains, the <span class="SpellE">Mangyans</span>
have always been at the receiving end whenever the transaction is between a
Christian and a <span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span>, so much so that in the case
at bar, it has been established by competent evidence that the accused,
especially <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardiniano</span>
wanted to grab the land of the deceased, in fact he was already given a sizable
portion of the land of the deceased which he distributed to his fellow
Christians, and he wanted to have the remaining land of <span class="SpellE">Balud</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span> even if it would cause him to kill somebody
as he did in killing <span class="SpellE">Balud</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangyan</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We come now to the nature of the crime committed <span style="">and </span>the penalty imposable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The qualifying circumstance o<span style="">f treachery </span>and other aggravating
circumstances of abuse of superior strength, nighttime, dwelling, evident
premeditation and employment of means to weaken the defense of the victim were
considered by the trial Court in imposing the death penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that treachery attended the
killing of the deceased because his hands were bound, after <span style="">which, he </span>was
clubbed to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such means tended
directly to insure the consummation of the crime with­out risk to the
aggressor, inasmuch as thus bound, the deceased could not defend himself in any
<span style="">manner </span>against his assailants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Abuse of superior
strength is also present but this is necessarily included in treachery.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

taken from his house although the offense was not completed therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that appellants purposely sought the cover of
night or that they had taken ad­vantage of it in order to facilitate the
commission of the crime, or for the purpose of impunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, even if attendant, it would be
deemed absorbed by treachery.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There being no proof as to how and when the plan to kill was
hatched, or what time elapsed before it was carried out, evident premeditation
can neither be appreciated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To properly
appreciate this circumstance, it is necessary to establish with proof, as clear
as the evidence of the crime itself, (1) the time when the offender determined
to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit has
clung to his determination; and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between the
determination and the execution to allow him to reflect.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no evidence either that means were employed by
appellants to weaken the defense of the victim and, therefore, this aggravating
circumstance should be disregarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">As treachery attended the perpetration of the offense, the
killing was qualified to Murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
penalty prescribed by law is <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <u>temporal</u> </span>in its maximum period
to death.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Because of the presence of the aggravating circumstance of dwelling, with no
mitigating circumstance to offset it, the penalty<span style=""> s</span>hould be imposed in its maximum period, which is death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For lack of the required number of votes for
the impo­sition of the death penalty, however, the sentence is reduced to <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, except for the penalty, which is modified to <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, the judgment appealed from is hereby
affirmed, with costs against the accused appellants.</p>
