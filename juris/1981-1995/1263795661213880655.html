<p class="BODY"><span>This </span>is a petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and 
Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 19) seeking to set aside the Orders of 
the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in Criminal Case 
No. CCC-VII-1406:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) dated June 4, 1974 amending its Resolution 
dated May 15, 1974 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 28); (b) dated 
January 26, 1978 directing petitioner to comply <span>with </span>the

44); and (c) dated April 21, 1978 denying petitioner's Motion for 
Reconsideration (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 50); and praying 
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, <em>ex-parte</em> and 
without bond, pending final resolution of the merits of the petition, 
restraining respondent Judge from enforcing said Orders insofar as <span>they 
direct petitioner to reinstate the accused (herein private respondents) to their

<p class="BODY"><span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the

their suspension.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Let a copy of this Order be furnished the Department of Justice and 
the Acting Di<span>rector of Prisons for their valuable information and 
guidance."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Order dated </span><st1:date month="1" day="26" year="1978"><span>January 26, 1978</span></st1:date><span> 
states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Considering that based on the manifestation of the Solicitor 
General, there is available funds and General Vicente <span class="SpellE">Raval</span>, Acting Director of the National Penitentiary, is 
willing to pay, the Court resolves, as it is hereby resolved, to direct the 
Acting Director of Prisons to comply with the Order of the Court dated June 4, 
1974, within thirty (30) days from receipt hereof, reinstating all the 
above-named accused to their former positions and to authorize the payment of 
their salaries each accused failed to receive during the period of their 
suspension."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The Order dated <st1:date month="4" day="21" year="1978">April 21, 
1978</st1:date>, on the other hand states that:</p>
<blockquote>"Acting on the Motion for Reconsideration dated <st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1978">March 22, 1978</st1:date>, filed by the Assistant Solicitor 
General <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> Raquel-Santos and considering the

dated <st1:date month="6" day="4" year="1974">June 4, 1974</st1:date>, 
stands."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>
<p class="BODY">Private respondents were prison guards at the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prison when they were charged with Murder in 
Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">CCC-VII-1406-Rizal of the Circuit Criminal 
Court, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pasig</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">, Metro 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Pending trial of said murder case they were 
suspended and subsequently dismissed from the service on orders of then 
Secretary of Justice, pursuant to Letter of Instructions No. 14-A of the 
President (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 20).<span>&nbsp; </span>On 
<st1:date month="5" day="20" year="1974">May 20, 1974</st1:date> respondent 
Court promulgated its Resolution dated <st1:date month="5" day="15" year="1974">May 15, 1974</st1:date> acquitting the accused of the crime charged 
for failure of the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused, beyond 
reasonable doubt (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 28).</p>
<p class="BODY">On motion of private respondents, dated <st1:date month="5" day="27" year="1974">May 27, 1974</st1:date>, respondent Court amended its 
Resolution of <st1:date month="5" day="15" year="1974">May 15, 1974</st1:date>, 
to include the reinstatement of private respondents to their respective 
positions before indictment and to authorize the payment of their back salaries 
during the <span>period of their suspension.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus the questioned Order of </span></span><st1:date month="6" day="4" year="1974"><span class="GramE"><span>June 4, 
1974</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span>.</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date month="6" day="14" year="1974"><span>June 14, 1974</span></st1:date><span> respondents, save Miguel 
<span class="SpellE">Palamos</span> who died during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, were reinstated to their 
positions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead of authorizing the payment of the back salaries 
of respondents, however, petitioner forwarded the Order to the Secretary of 
Justice who denied the same in a 2<sup>nd</sup> <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated </span><st1:date month="8" day="7" year="1974"><span>August 7, 1974</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Subsequently, on motion of respondents </span><span>f</span><span>or the 
execution of the Order, respondent Court issued another Order dated October 3, 
1977, stating that the Acting Director of Prisons is fully bound by its Order 
directing the payment of the back salaries claimed by respondents during the 
period of their suspension, April 6, 1971 to June 13, 1974, for the reason that 
it has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Again, petitioner, instead of complying, forwarded the Order of 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="3" year="1977"><span>October 3, 
1977</span></st1:date><span> to</span><span> </span><span>the Secretary of 
Justice who reinstated his denial in a communication to the respondents dated 
</span><st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1977"><span>December 29, 
1977</span></st1:date><span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
33-34).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On January 3, 1978 respondents filed their motion to declare 
petitioner in contempt of court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
33), which was opposed by petitioner on the ground that an order or mandate 
which is void, because it was issued by a court without jurisdiction over the 
subject or </span>the parties litigant, as in this case, cannot be considered a 
contempt and that respondent Court acted without jurisdiction in including in 
the order the reinstatement and payment of the back salaries of respondents 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 40).<span>&nbsp; </span><span>Without 
granting or denying the motion to declare petitioner in contempt of court, 
respondent Court issued the Order of </span><st1:date month="1" day="26" year="1978"><span>January 26, 
1978</span></st1:date><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="3" day="16" year="1978">March 16, 
1978</st1:date> petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 45) of the Orders of respondent Court 
dated <st1:date month="6" day="4" year="1974">June 4, 1974</st1:date> and 
<st1:date month="1" day="26" year="1978">January 26, 1978</st1:date>; which was 
however denied in the Order of Respondent Court dated <st1:date month="4" day="21" year="1978">April 21, 1978</st1:date>, above-quoted.</p>
<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition, filed on <st1:date month="8" day="23" year="1978">August 23, 1978</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 19).<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondents filed 
their Comment on <st1:date month="10" day="2" year="1978"><span>October 2, 
1978</span></st1:date><span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 62) 
in compliance with the resolution of the First Division of this Court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 52).<span>&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="10" day="9" year="1978"><span>October 9, 1978</span></st1:date><span>, 
the Court resolved to give due course to the petition and to require both 
parties to submit simultaneous Memoranda.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 70).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Respondents filed their <span class="SpellE">Memoradum</span> on 
<st1:date month="11" day="20" year="1978">November 20, 1978</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 79); petitioner filed his <span class="SpellE">Memoradum</span> on <st1:date month="1" day="25" year="1979">January 25, 1979</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 101).</p>
<p class="BODY">The only issue raised by Petitioner in this case is whether or not 
respondent Court acted within its jurisdiction when in an Order absolving the 
accused from criminal liability, it at the same time directed the Acting 
Director of Prisons to reinstate said accused to their former positions and to 
authorize the payment of their supposed back salaries during the period of their 
alleged suspension (actually dismissal).</p>
<p class="BODY">Considering, however, that private respondents have already been 
reinstated to their former positions as<span> </span><span>prison guards, the 
issue with respect to the reinstatement of respondents to their previous 
positions before they were indicted has become moot and academic.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>All that remains to be decided is whether or not it is within the 
jurisdiction of respondent Court to order petitioner to authorize the payment of 
the salaries of respondents during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the 
criminal case filed against them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Respondents alleged that they are entitled to payment of the 
salaries they failed to receive during their suspension (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 82), citing Section 4 of </span>R.A. 
<span>557 repealing Sec. 2272 of the Revised Administrative Code, Sec. 4 of R.A. 
557 reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"When a member of the provincial guards, city police or municipal 
police is accused in court of any felony or violation of law by the provincial 
fiscal or city fiscal, as the case may be, the provincial governor, the city 
mayor or the municipal mayor shall immediately suspend the accused from office 
pending the final decision of the case by the court and, in case of acquittal, 
the accused shall be entitled to payment of the entire salary he failed to 
receive during his suspension."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Also cited was the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Noremor</em></span><em> v. 
</em></span><em><st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename>Oras</st1:placename></st1:place></em><st1:place><st1:placename></st1:placename></st1:place><span>, 
7 SCRA 405 (1963) which considered the above-quoted provision as 
mandatory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioner, on the other hand, holds a contrary view (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 104), citing <em>People v. Daleon</em>, 1 
SCRA 759 (1961), wherein the Court held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"The question is not new.<span>&nbsp; </span>In at least three cases 
previously decided by this Court (<em>People v. Mañago</em>, 69 Phil. 496; <span class="SpellE"><em>Publo</em></span><em> v. Lagutan</em>, 70 Phil. 481; <em>Manila 
Railroad Co. v. Baltazar, et al.</em>, L-5451, Sept. 14, 1953), We have ruled 
that the trial court, in a criminal action for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds wherein the accused is 
acquitted, is without power to order the payment of his salary during the period 
of his suspension.<span>&nbsp; </span>The reason is that the only issue joined by the 
plea of not guilty is whether or not the accused committed the crime charged in 
the information, and in such case, the only judgment that the court is legally 
authorized to render is either one of acquittal or of conviction with the 
indemnity to the injured party and the accessory penalties provided for by 
law.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Daleon</span> 
cites several cases wherein we upheld the right of an accused of the crime of 
<span class="SpellE">malversation</span>, in case of acquittal, to back salaries 
and reinstatement, but these cases are not in point because they involved 
appeals either from civil actions or from administrative proceedings seeking 
such remedies.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other words, while an accused acquitted of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> may claim payment of back salaries during the 
period of his suspension and reinstatement, his relief lies not in the same 
criminal case wherein he is acquitted but in the proper administrative or civil 
action prescribed by law.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is modified by eliminating 
<span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the portion which orders the payment of 
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Antonio E. <span class="SpellE">Daleon's</span> 
salary during the period of his suspension from office.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Antonio E. <span class="SpellE">Daleon</span>."</span> (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Daleon</span>, 1 SCRA 760).</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Republic Act No. 557 is a special law which applies only to 
provincial guards, city and municipal policemen with civil service eligibility 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Kordovez</em></span><em> v. Carmona</em>, 21 SCRA 678 
[1967]).<span>&nbsp; </span>It is evident that it does not apply to respondents who 
are <span class="GramE">neither provincial guards, city policemen or</span> 
municipal policemen but prison guards.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Noremor</span> case cannot be cited in favor of 
Respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Another point that militates against the payment of back 
salaries of respondents which respondent Court failed to consider is the fact 
that respondents were </span>removed from the service during their suspension 
pursuant to Letter of Instructions No. 14-A, dated <st1:date month="9" day="29" year="1972">September 29, 1972</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a settled rule 
that in the absence of proof that the dismissal of respondents was tainted with 
bad faith and in grave abuse of discretion, they are not entitled to back 
salaries (<span class="SpellE"><em>Octot</em></span><em> v. Ibañez</em>, 111 SCRA 
79 [1982]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Clemente</em></span><em> v. Commission on 
Audit</em>, 128 SCRA 297 [1984]).</p>
<p class="BODY">The records show that when respondents were acquitted by the trial 
court in the Order of May 15, 1974, which was subsequently amended by the Order 
of June 4, 1974 including their reinstatement and payment of back salaries, 
petitioner readily reinstated respondents to their previous positions on June 
14, 1974 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 80) but could not 
authorize payment of back salaries against the advice of the then Secretary of 
Justice.<span>&nbsp; </span>This shows that the dismissal of respondents was not 
motivated by ill will or personal malice but only by a desire on the part of 
petitioner to comply with the mandate of Letter of Instructions No. 14-A.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Moreover, as pointed out, LOI No. 647 does not authorize payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> <span>of </span>reinstated employees.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Octot</em></span><em> v. 
Ibañez, supra</em>).</span></p>
