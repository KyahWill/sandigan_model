On October 9, 1968, then Rizal Provincial Fiscal Benjamin H. Aquino 
filed an information in the then Court of First Instance at Pasig, 
Rizal, docketed as Criminal Case No. 18425 and entitled:  "The People of
 the Philippines vs. Rodolfo Ceñidoza, Jose R. Baricua, Cesario B. Ong, 
Lucio Adriano, Jr. and Adriano Castillo," for estafa thru falsification 
of official and/or public documents.  Said criminal case, which arose 
from the huge expansion in the area after a resurvey and subdivision of a
 certain parcel of registered land in Muntinlupa, Rizal, and the 
approval by certain officials of the Land Registration Commission of the
 corresponding plans and technical descriptions prepared by the surveyor
 who resurveyed and subdivided the property, was assigned to the branch 
of the then Court of First Instance of Rizal presided by Hon. Pedro 
Revilla.
<p>
On October 27, 1968, Lucio Adriano, Jr., one of the defendants in said Criminal Case No. 18425, instituted a petition for <em>mandamus</em>
 in the then Court of First Instance of Rizal praying for an order 
directing Fiscal Aquino to include as defendants in the information 
filed by him in Criminal Case No. 18425 (not 18245) - all persons of 
whom he found a <em>prima facie</em> case as stated by him in Annex "B" 
of his Petition, particularly, Commissioner Antonio Noblejas of the Land
 Registration Commission, who, in the meantime, resigned from the 
office.  The <em>mandamus</em> case, docketed as Civil Case No. 11307, 
was assigned to Branch X, presided by herein respondent Judge Herminio 
C. Mariano, who, thereafter, rendered a decision, dated March 28, 1969, 
granting the petition for <em>mandamus</em>, the dispositive portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, decision is hereby rendered in 
favor of the petitioner and against the respondent, granting 
petitioner's prayer for the issuance of a Writ of <em>Mandamus</em>, 
directing the respondent Benjamin H. Aquino, Provincial Fiscal of Rizal,
 to include as accused in the information filed by him in Criminal Case 
No. 18425 (not 18245) of this Court, all persons, including Commissioner
 Antonio Noblejas, against whom he found a <em>prima facie</em> case as 
stated by him in his second indorse­ment dated June 20, 1968 addressed 
to the Secretary of Justice, a copy of which is attached to the present 
petition as Annex "B" thereof. </p>
  <p> "Let the corresponding Writ of <em>Mandamus</em> issue."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, this petition for review by <em>certiorari</em> praying that the 
decision of respondent Court of First Instance be set aside and 
declaring that herein petitioner cannot be compelled to include former 
Commissioner Antonio Noblejas as one of the accused in Criminal Case No.
 18425.
</p><p>
There is merit in the petition.
</p><p>
As stated in the decision sought to be reviewed, herein petitioner 
conducted the corresponding preliminary investigation in the case 
assigned to him and, in a second indorsement to the then Secretary of 
Justice, dated June 20, 1968, he had expressed the view that a strong <em>prima facie</em>
 case exists against Commissioner Noblejas and, therefore, recommended 
strongly that he be allowed to file the corresponding information 
against said commissioner and all other persons whom he found in his 
investigation to be criminally liable for the offense complained of.  
However, Fiscal Aquino, after a period of more than two months from the 
time he made his second indorsement, addressed a memorandum, dated 
September 2, 1968, to the then Secretary of Justice stating, among 
others, that in view of the offer of Commissioner Noblejas to resign 
from office and in the light of the Commissioner's explanation, he 
(herein petitioner) found the responsibility of said commissioner, if 
any, to be only administrative in nature.  Thus, the information was 
filed without including Commissioner Noblejas as one of the accused.
</p><p>
In the light of the foregoing facts, is the proper remedy of private respondent Adriano, Jr., an action for <em>mandamus</em>,
 or a simple motion in Criminal Case No. 18425 with prayer for an order 
directing Fiscal Aquino to include in the information Commissioner 
Antonio Noblejas as one of the defendants therein?
</p><p>
The Revised Rules of Court (Section 3, Rule 65) on Petition for <em>Mandamus</em>
 provides that "[when any tribunal, corporation, board, or person 
unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically
 enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station, or 
unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or 
office to which such other is entitled, and there is no other plain, 
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, the person 
aggrieved thereby may file a verified petition in the proper court 
alleging the facts with certainty and praying that judgment be rendered 
commanding the defendant, immediately or at some other specified time, 
to do the act required to be done to protect the rights of the 
petitioner, and to pay the damages sustained by the petitioner, by 
reason of the wrongful acts of the defendant." Stated differently, <em>mandamus</em>
 is an extraordinary remedy that can be resorted to only in cases of 
extreme necessity where the ordinary forms of procedure are powerless to
 afford relief where there is no other clear, adequate and speedy 
remedy.  Before a writ of <em>mandamus</em> may be issued, it is 
obligatory upon the petitioner to exhaust all remedies in the ordinary 
course of law.  He must show that the duty sought to be performed must 
be one which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an 
office.  (Quintero vs. Martinez, 84 Phil. 496; Perez vs. City Mayor of 
Cabanatuan, 3 SCRA 431; Alzate vs. Aldana, 8 SCRA 219; and, Caltex 
Filipino Managers and Supervisors Association vs. Court of Industrial 
Relations, 23 SCRA 492).
</p><p>
Thus, if appeal or some other equally adequate remedy is still available in the ordinary course of law, the action for <em>mandamus</em>
 would be improper.  In the case at bar, private respondent Adriano, Jr.
 did not request Fiscal Aquino to include in the information 
Commissioner Noblejas as one of the accused.  Had he done so and the 
same was met with a denial, Adriano, Jr. could have appealed to the 
Secretary of Justice who may reverse petitioner and designate another to
 act for the purpose.  That way, the filing of a simple motion with the 
Fiscal to include or to amend the information is much more speedy and 
adequate than a petition for <em>mandamus</em>.  As aptly stated by the Solicitor General in his brief for the petitioner:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x By just presenting the motion, there will be no need of 
paying any docket fee and the numbering of another case; there will be 
no issuance and service of a summons or of an order equivalent thereto; 
there will be no more raffles to determine the sala of the court to 
which the case will be assigned; and there will be no pre-trial, all of 
which necessarily consume time.  At least, there is no prohibition in 
the rules against this procedure.  After all, a motion is defined as 
'every application for an order not included in a judgment' (Sec. 1, 
Rule 15, of the Revised Rules of Court). </p>
  <p align="center"> "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>
  <p> "The conclusion is therefore inevitable that the filing of a mere 
motion in the criminal case to achieve the same purpose as prayed for in
 the petition for <em>mandamus</em> is not only an adequate remedy but even a plainer, speedier, and more adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law than <em>mandamus</em>. </p>
  <p> "Another substantial argument in favor of filing only a motion in the criminal case instead of the petition for <em>mandamus</em>
 is that it will avoid multiplicity of suits which modern procedure 
abhors (3 Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, 1963 ed., p. 134)"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Otherwise stated, before filing the present action for <em>mandamus</em>
 in the court below, private respondent Adriano, Jr. should have availed
 of this administrative remedy and his failure to do so is fatal.  To 
place his case beyond the pale of this rule, it must be shown that his 
case falls - which it did not - within the cases where, in accordance 
with this Court's decisions, the aggrieved party need not exhaust 
administrative remedies within his reach in the ordinary course of the 
law (Tapales vs. the President and the Board of Regents of the U.P., 
G.R. No. L-17523, March 30, 1963; Mangubat vs. Osmeña, G.R. No. L-12837,
 April 30, 1959; Baguio vs. Honorable Jose Rodriguez, G.R. No. L-11078, 
May 27, 1959; Pascual vs. Provincial Board, G. R. No. L-11959, October 
31, 1959; Marinduque Iron Mines, etc. vs. Secretary of Public Works, 
G.R. No. L-15982, May 31, 1963; Alzate vs. Aldaba, G.R. L-14407, 
February 29, 1960 and Demaisip vs. Court of Appeals, G. R. No. L-13000, 
September 25, 1959).
</p><p>
Neither is there merit in the argument that if a motion is presented 
before the trial judge he would be prejudging the case if he should 
grant the same because such a resolution will be premised only on a <em>prima facie</em> evidence, while a judgment of conviction must be based on evidence beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED and the decision dated March 28, 1969, of respondent judge is SET ASIDE.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, J., (Chairman),</em> no part.
