claiming instead that </span>complainant had subjected him to systematic
harassment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By a Resolution dated 20
January 1987, this Court referred this matter to Associate Justice Eduardo R. <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> of the Court of Appeals for investigation, report,
and recommendations, and at the same time, suspended respondent Judge from
office pending the investigation and until further orders from the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Report dated <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="6">29 June
 1987</st1:date>, of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> shows that
the hearings held in this administrative matter had in effect to be conducted <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> because respondent Judge never appeared at the
scheduled hearings to present his defense, if any.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the outset, hearings were scheduled on 25,

that he was experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the acceptance

the instance of the complainant, hearings were reset once more to 4, 5, and <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="5">6 May 1987</st1:date>, again at <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30 P.M.</st1:time> to afford respondent Judge once more
an opportunity to be heard and to cross-examine the witnesses of the
complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="5">4 May 1987</st1:date>,
however, only complainant and his lawyer appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order not to take advantage of
