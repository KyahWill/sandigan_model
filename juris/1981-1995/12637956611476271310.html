<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts of the case are as follows:</p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent Universal Rubber Products, Inc. filed an application 
with the Philippine Patent office for registration of the trademark "UNIVERSAL 
CONVERSE AND DEVICE" used on rubber shoes and rubber slippers.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioner Converse Rubber Corporation filed its opposition 
to the application for registration on grounds that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><i>a) The trademark sought to be </i><i><span>registered is 
</span>confusingly </i><i><span>similar </span>to </i><i><span>the </span>word 
"CONVERSE" which is part of petitioner's corporate name </i><i><span>"CONVERSE 
RUBBER CORPORATION" </span>as </i><i><span>to likely deceive purchasers 
</span>of </i><i><span>products on </span>which </i><i><span>it is </span>to be 
used</i><i><span> </span>to </i><i><span>an extent that said products may 
</span>be </i><i><span>mistaken </span>b</i><i><span>y the </span>unwary 
</i><i><span>public to be manufactured </span>by </i><i><span>the petitioner; 
</span>and,<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>b) The </i><i><span>registration of respondent's </span>trademark 
will cause great </i><i><span>and </span>irreparable </i><i><span>injury 
</span>to the business reputation and goodwill of petitioner in </i><i><span>the 
Philippines and would </span>cause damage to said</i><i><span> petitioner 
</span>within the meaning of Section 8, </i><i><span>R.A. No. 166, as</span> 
amended.</i></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Thereafter, respondent filed its answer and at the 
pre-trial, the parties submitted the following partial stipulation of 
facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><i><span>“1)<span>&nbsp; </span></span>The petitioner's corporate name is

</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>At the trial, petitioner's lone witness, Mrs. Carmen B. 
<span class="SpellE">Pacquing</span>, a duly licensed private merchant with stores 
at the Sta. Mesa Market and in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> 
</span><span>City, </span><span>testified that she had been selling CONVERSE 
rubber shoes in the local market since 1956 and that sales of petitioner's 
rubber shoes in her stores averaged twelve to twenty pairs a month purchased 
mostly by basketball players of local private educational institutions like 
<span class="SpellE">Ateneo</span>, La Salle and San <span class="SpellE">Beda</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pacquing</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> further stated that

rubber shoes were described as "Converse Chuck Taylor"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>, "Converse All Star"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>, "All Star Converse Chuck Taylor"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>, or "Converse Shoes Chuck Taylor"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>.<span>&nbsp; </span>She also affirmed that she 
had no business connection with the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Respondent, on the other hand, presented as its lone witness 
the secretary of said corporation who testified that respondent has been selling 
on wholesale basis "Universal Converse" sandals since 1962 </span>and 
<span>"Universal Converse" rubber shoes since 1963.<span>&nbsp; </span>Invoices were 
submitted as evidence of such sales.<span>&nbsp; </span>The witness also testified 
that she had no idea why respondent chose "Universal Converse" </span>as <span>a 
trademark and that she was unaware of the name "Converse" prior to her 
corporation's sale of "Universal Converse" rubber shoes and rubber 
sandals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Eventually, the Director of </span><span>Patents 
</span><span>dismissed the opposition of the petitioner and gave due course to 
respondent's application.<span>&nbsp; </span>His decision reads in 
part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><i>"xxx the only question for determination is whether

</span></i><i><span>identified with the </span>corporation that 
whene</i><i><span>ver</span> </i><i><span>used, it designates </span>to 
</i><i><span>the mind </span>of the public that particular 
corporation.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The proofs herein are sales made by a single witness who had

</i><i><span>in the Philippines, and </span>is not doing business of its own in

<p class="BODY"><span>Its motion for reconsideration having been denied by the 
respondent Director of Patents, petitioner instituted the instant petition for 
review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>As correctly phrased by public respondent Director of 
Patents, the basic issue presented for our consideration is whether or not the 
respondent's partial appropriation of petitioner's corporate name is of such 
character that it is calculated to deceive or confuse the public to the injury 
of the petitioner to which the name belongs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">"A trade name is any individual name or surname, <em>firm 
name</em>, device or word used by manufacturers, industrialists, merchants and 
others to identify their businesses, vocations or occupations".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> "As the trade name refers to the business 
and its goodwill x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the 
trademark refers to the goods".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The 
ownership of a trademark or <span class="SpellE">tradename</span> is a property 
right which the owner is entitled to protect "since there is damage to him from 
confusion or reputation or good<span>will in the mind of the public as well as 
from confusion of goods.<span>&nbsp; </span>The modern trend is to give emphasis to 
the unfairness of the acts and to classify and treat the issue as fraud".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>From a cursory appreciation of the petitioner's corporate 
name "CONVERSE RUBBER CORPORATION', it is evident that the word "CONVERSE" is 
the dominant word which identifies petitioner from other 
</span><span>corporations </span><span>engaged in similar business.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Respondent, in the stipulation of facts, admitted petitioner's existence 
since 1946 as a duly organized foreign corporation engaged in the manufacture of 
rubber shoes.<span>&nbsp; </span>This admission necessarily betrays its knowledge of 
the reputation and business of petitioner even before it applied for 
registration of the trademark in question.<span>&nbsp; </span>Knowing, therefore, 
that the word "CONVERSE" belongs to and is being used by petitioner, and is in 
fact the dominant word in petitioner's corporate name, respondent has no right 
to appropriate the same for use on its products which are similar to those being 
produced by petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">"A corporation is entitled to the cancellation of a mark that is 
confusingly similar to its corporate name".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> "Appropriation by another of the dominant 
part of a corporate name is an infringement".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Respondent's witness had no idea why respondent chose 
"UNIVERSAL CONVERSE" as trademark and the record discloses no reasonable 
explanation for respondent's use of the word "CONVERSE" in its trademark.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Such unexplained use by respondent of the dominant word of petitioner's 
corporate name lends itself open to the suspicion of fraudulent motive to trade 
upon petitioner's reputation, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"<em>A boundless choice of words, phrases and symbols is available 
to one who wishes a trademark sufficient unto itself to distinguish his product 
from those of others.&nbsp; When, however, there is no reasonable explanation for the 
defendant's choice of such a mark though the field for his selection was so 
broad, the inference is inevitable that it was chosen deliberately to 
deceive</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The testimony of petitioner's witness, who is a legitimate 
trader as well as the invoices evidencing sales of petitioner's products in the 
Philippines, give credence to petitioner's claim that it has earned a business 
reputation and goodwill in this country.<span>&nbsp; </span>The sales invoices 
submitted by petitioner's lone witness show that it is the word "CONVERSE" that 
mainly identifies petitioner's products, i.e. "CONVERSE </span>CHUCK 
<span>TAYLOR",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> "CONVERSE ALL 
STAR",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> "ALL STAR CONVERSE 
</span>CHUCK <span>TAYLOR",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> or 
"CONVERSE SHOES CHUCK and TAYLOR".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
Thus, contrary to the determination of the respondent Director of Patents, the 
word "CONVERSE" has grown to be identified with petitioner's products, and in 
this sense, has acquired a second meaning within the context of trademark and 
<span class="SpellE">tradename</span> laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Furthermore, said sales invoices provide the best proof that 
there were actual sales of petitioner's products in the country and that there 
was actual use for a protracted period of peti</span>tioner's trademark or part 
thereof through these sales.<span>&nbsp; </span>"The most convincing proof of use of 
a mark in commerce is testimony of such witnesses as customers, or the orders of 
buyers during a certain period."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
Petitioner's witness, having affirmed her lack of business connections with 
petitioner, has testified as such customer, supporting strongly petitioner's 
move for trademark pre-emption.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The sales of 12 to 20 pairs a month of petitioner's rubber 
shoes cannot be considered insignificant, considering that they appear to be of 
high expensive quality, which not too </span>many basketball players can afford 
to buy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Any sale made by a legitimate trader from his store is a 
commercial act establishing trademark rights since such sales are made in due 
course of business to the general public, not only to limited 
individuals.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a matter of public knowledge that all brands of 
goods filter into the market, indiscriminately sold by jobbers, dealers and 
merchants not necessarily with the knowledge or consent of the 
manufacturer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such actual sale of goods in the local market 
establishes trademark use which serves as the basis for any action aimed at 
trademark pre-emption.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is a corollary logical deduction that 
while Converse Rubber Corporation is not licensed to do business in the country 
and is not actually doing business here, it does not mean that its goods are not 
being sold here or that it has not earned a reputation or goodwill as regards 
its products.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Director of Patents was, therefore, remiss in 
ruling that the proofs of sales presented "was made by a single witness who had 
never dealt with nor had never known <span class="SpellE">opposer</span> 
[petitioner] x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> without 
<span class="SpellE">Opposer</span> having a direct or indirect hand in the 
transaction to be the basis of trademark pre-<span class="SpellE">emtpion</span>."</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Another factor why respondent's application should be denied 
is the confusing similarity between its trademark "UNIVERSAL CONVERSE AND 
DEVICE" and petitioner's corporate name and/or its trademarks "CHUCK TAYLOR" and 
"ALL STAR DEVICE" which could confuse the purchasing public to the prejudice of 
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The trademark of respondent "UNIVERSAL CONVERSE and DEVICE" 
is imprinted in a circular manner on the side of its rubber shoes.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In the same manner, the trademark of petitioner which reads "CONVERSE 
CHUCK TAYLOR" is imprinted on a circular base attached to the side of its rubber 
shoes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The determinative factor </span><span>in 
</span><span>ascertaining whether or not marks are confusingly similar to each 
other "is not whether the challenged mark would actually cause confusion or 
deception of the purchasers but whether the use of such mark would likely cause 
confusion or mistake on the part </span><span>of </span><span>the buying 
public.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would be sufficient, for purposes of the <span class="GramE">law, that</span> the similarity between the two labels is such that 
there is a possibility or likelihood of the purchaser of the older brand 
mistaking the new brand for it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Even 
if not all the details just mentioned were identical, with the general 
appearance alone of the two products, any ordinary, or even perhaps even [sic] a 
not too perceptive and discriminating customer could be deceived x</span><span> 
</span><span class="SpellE"><span>x</span></span><span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">When the law speaks of "purchaser", the reference is to ordinary 
average purchasers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> "It is not 
necessary in either case that the resemblance <span class="GramE">be</span> 
sufficient to deceive experts, dealers, or other persons specially familiar with 
the trademark or goods involved."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> 
</p>
<p class="BODY">The similarity in the general appearance of respondent's trademark 
and that of petitioner would evidently create a likelihood of confusion among 
the purchasing public.<span>&nbsp; </span>But even assuming, <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>, that the trademark sought to be registered by 
respondent is distinctively dissimilar from those of the petitioner, the 
likelihood of confusion would still subsist, not on the purchaser's perception 
of the goods but on the origins thereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>By appropriating the word 
"CONVERSE", respondent's products are likely to be mistaken as having been 
produced by petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>"The risk of damage is not limited to a 
possible confusion of goods but also includes confusion of reputation if the 
public could reasonably assume that the goods of the parties originated from the 
same source.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is unfortunate that respondent Director of Patents has 
concluded that since the petitioner is not licensed to do business in the 
country and is actually not doing business on its own in the Philippines, it has 
no name to protect in the forum and thus, it is futile for it to establish that 
"CONVERSE" as part of its corporate name identifies its rubber shoes.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>That a foreign corporation has a right to maintain an action in the forum 
even if it is not licensed to do business and is not actually doing business on 
its own therein has been enunciated many times by this Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
<em>La Chemise Lacoste, S.A. vs. Fernandez</em>, 129 SCRA 373, this Court, 
reiterating <em>Western Equipment and Supply Co. vs. Reyes</em>, 51 Phil. 115, 
stated that:</span></p>
<blockquote><i><span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> a foreign corporation which has never done any business in
