standing at the terrace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not long after
she had entered her bedroom, and while she was getting her clothes from the
cabinet, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
opened the door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was astonished and

pinned her down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He strangled her with
his right hand even as he held her right hand with his other hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to shout but she could not owing
to her strangulation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For ten minutes
she struggled to free herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="GramE">futile,</span> <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> was heavy and strong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her legs were spread apart by his two legs

excruciating pain as his private organ was being driven into her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">genitalia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> drove

<p class="2Q">Copulation was consummated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> stood up and
warned <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> not to report the matter to her aunt or
to anyone or else something would happen to her and the whole family.</p>

<p class="2Q">When <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
left her, she scrutinized her private parts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was bleeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She cannot do <span class="SpellE">anyting</span> but cry her misfortune.</p>

she thought it was useless and futile.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He removed her panty and mounted her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It took him about five minutes to consummate coition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> enjoined her not to report the matter to anybody or

children were still asleep in their room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> approached her from behind,
held her by the shoulder, and instructed her to follow him to the master's
bedroom because he would tell her something.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She obliged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As she entered the
room, Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> pushed her back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He went on top of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She struggled to extricate herself but he was
too strong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He removed her panty and
inserted his sexual organ into her private part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he made a push and <span class="GramE">pull</span>

sworn statement she gave to the Rosales Police, marked as Exhibit "F".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, she was unable to sue Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> for this act because the venue was in <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, she confided to her uncle,
Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Salimbay</span>, her horrible experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Salimbay</span>

<p class="BODY">All the assigned errors raised by the accused-appellants <span class="GramE">revolve</span> around the issue of credibility of the witnesses,
especially the complaining witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
and Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> imputed to the trial court, as
its first error, its giving credence to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the
</span>testimony of complainant Ma. Eliza <span class="SpellE">Jorique</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their attempt to mislead this Honorable
Court and to destroy the credibility of the testimony of herein complainant,
they cite portions of complainant's testimony which do not pertain to Criminal
Case No. 2070-R (case subject of this appeal) but rather to Criminal Case No.
20866-R, wherein as declared by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">, </span>the prosecution had failed to prove
the element of force and intimidation but not in so far as the issue of carnal
communication is concerned, hence, in said Criminal Case No. 2086-R the
appellant <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
was acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such allegations of the appellants deserve no merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aforementioned gross misrepresentation
made by the appellants serves as their desperate attempt to show that the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred in its findings of fact and conclusions, but as can
be gleaned from the records of the case, the trial court was morally convinced
and <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span> stated without doubt, "that
indeed Alejandro and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
did really had sexual congress with <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">Liza</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> on </span>the
dates specified in the three (3) <span class="SpellE">informations</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such fact is confirmed by the healed
laceration in <span class="SpellE">Liza's</span> hymen at 6:00 o'clock position,
and the fact that the vulva can admit two fingers, a circumstance strongly
indicating that she had sexual intercourse more than once" (RTC, Decision,
p. 9, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, 104).</p>

<p class="BODY">It was not difficult for Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
to accomplish his bestial act because, like his brother <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, he was robust and tall, about five (5) feet
and nine (9) inches, against <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> who was small and
short.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also important to note that
Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> had an ascendancy over <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> because he was regarded by her as an uncle (being the
common-law husband of her aunt Ester <span class="SpellE">Salimbay</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> had exercised strong moral <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">and </span>physical influence over <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> which
aided him in consummating sexual intercourse with her with least resistance (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 36, RTC Decision).</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Savellano</span>, 57 SCRA 328,
it was held that force or violence necessary in rape is naturally a relative
term, depending on the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation
to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary that
the force employed be so great or of such character as could not be resisted;
it is only necessary that the force used by the guilty party be sufficient to
consummate the purpose (US vs. <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>, 4 Phil.
434).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> asserts that
the rape charges against him were instigated by <span class="SpellE">Liza's</span>
mother Elena <span class="SpellE">Salimbay</span>, who allegedly was his former
mistress, out of hatred and jealousy, for taking another woman, Ester <span class="SpellE">Salimbay</span> (Elena's own sister), as his new mistress.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is likewise unmeritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the records would reveal that <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> filed the charges by herself, unaided by her
mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact it was not to her mother
that she revealed her horrible experience, rather she sought the assistance of
her uncle Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Salimbay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is therefore no possible motive on the
part of this young and unsophisticated girl in bringing this suit, but only to
seek justice and vindication of the wrong committed against her honor (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 39, RTC Decision).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this court has, time and again, stated in similar cases
of rape that no woman, especially one of tender age, would willingly expose
herself to the <span class="SpellE">embarassment</span> and humiliation of a
public trial wherein she would have not only to admit but also to narrate the
violation of her person, unless such was really the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another argument interposed by the appellants is that the alleged
incidents of rape are unbelievable because of the actuations of the complainant
Ma. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Liza</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">Jorique</span> before, during and after the commission of said
sexual abuse.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in this pretense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold the same opinion as that of the lower
court, that it is not uncommon to see women coming out of the bathroom in their
respective homes clad only with a towel, especially so when the bathroom is
just a few steps away from bedroom or adjacent to the bedroom.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the claim that the complainant did not lock her
bedroom, said actuations can be considered as lacking in precaution but this
cannot in any way impair her credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What is important to note is that appellant <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> succeeded in having carnal knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> by the use of force and violence and against her
will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, all the essential
elements of rape existed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further claimed that complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">did </span>not offer any resistance against <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span> lustful
advances.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is likewise untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is very clear from the records that the
victim <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> <span class="SpellE">Jorique</span> in her
direct and cross-examination categorically declared before the court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>she really offered resistance all
throughout the sexual attack of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, but her resistance proved to be futile.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly explained by the court <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> </span><u>quo</u>:</p>

<p class="2Q">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> she
is a petite but pretty girl and not more than five feet tall as against <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> who as seen by the court is robust and about five
feet and nine (9) inches tall." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 110,
RTC Decision)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">It is </span>therefore
important to point at this instance, that the failure of the complainant to
successfully resist <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span>
carnal advances is not a manifestation of consent, but rather an indication of
an involuntary submission in the face of the consummation of the outrage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also an indication that the complainant
yielded because of authentic apprehension and real fear of immediate death or
great bodily harm (People vs. Dolores, CA-G.R. No. 18065-R, August 23, 1957).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, herein appellants aver that there are several
inconsistencies and contradictions in the testimony of complainant <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> <span class="SpellE">Jorique</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a </span>careful review <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">of the </span>entire
record, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that such <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">inconsistencies and </span>contradictions are minor and trivial which
will not necessarily affect complainant's disposition of being candid,
straightforward, spontaneous and sincere in her declarations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, such inconsistencies are well-expected to come from an
unexposed barrio lass not used to the rigors of public trial (People vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Valdez</st1:place></st1:city>,
150 SCRA 405).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, herein appellants claim that delay in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">filing </span>of the complaint (only on <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1986</st1:date>) casts a serious <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">doubt on </span>the veracity of the accusations
made (Appellant's Brief, pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">10-</span>11;
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 116).</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">We</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>find the said argument to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">be </span>lacking in merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the records of the case show that
the complaints were filed on <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="6">June 17,
 1986</st1:date>, which is two days after Alejandro <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Aquino</span></span> committed his dastardly act on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the complainant <span class="SpellE">Liza</span> <span class="SpellE">Jorique</span> did not immediately
report the previous sexual congresses committed against her was due to her fear
for her life and the lives of her relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 116)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not odd for young girls to conceal for sometime the
assaults on their virtue because of the rapist's threat on their lives (People
vs. San Buenaventura, 164 SCRA 150).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This court has already recognized that concealment by young girls of
rape against them <span class="GramE">are</span> not uncommon because of their
fear not only for their own life but also the lives of their relatives and
their friends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We also repeatedly held
that delay in reporting a rape incident due to death threats is justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Valdez</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
