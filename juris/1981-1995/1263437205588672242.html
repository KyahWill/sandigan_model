				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">MURDER is abhorrent; it becomes even more when the perpetrators are
men in uniform, in active service, sworn to maintain the peace, protect the
body politic and uphold the rule of law.  This case may yet serve as a grim reminder, a foreboding, of the current
state of affairs in the country -- policemen, military officers, agents of the
law, garbed in filthy outfit, drinking inordinately in public places, flaunting
their arms as symbols of their authority, rebuking, beating, maiming, killing
one another without rhyme or reason, hitting innocent bystanders in the crossfires,
a sheer antithesis of their role in civilized society.</p>

<p class="BODY">SGT. FELIX PADILLA was a member of the Philippine Air Force (PAF)
assigned to U-2, the intelligence unit of General Headquarters, Armed Forces of
the Philippines (GHQ-AFP), then under the Eastern Command, now Regional Unified
Command (RUC-8) stationed at Camp Lukban, Catbalogan, Samar.  He was charged together with his Senior
Officer, Maj. Ildefonso de la Cruz, before the then Court of First Instance of
Catbalogan, Samar, with the crime of murder qualified by treachery, evident
premeditation and taking advantage of his public position, for the fatal
shooting on 5 May 1981 of his comrade-in-arms, Pfc. Edino Ontuca, Officer-in­-Charge
of the Talalora Police Sub-Station.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> Two
aggravating circumstances were alleged to have attended the commission of the
offense, namely, the aid of armed men,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> and
abuse of superior strength.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 March 1983, upon motion of the prosecution, a
re-investigation was granted by the trial court.  As a result, the charge against Maj. de la Cruz was provisionally
dismissed but trial proceeded as to accused Padilla.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <i><span style="">a
quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>convicted Sgt.
Padilla of murder qualified by treachery with the generic aggravating
circumstance of taking advantage of his public position,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> but
appreciating at the same time the mitigating circumstance of sufficient
provocation in favor of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> After
offsetting the two attendant circumstances, the court imposed the medium of the
penalty prescribed for murder, which is <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style="">, </span>and
ordered the accused to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of
P30,000.00, and to pay the costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant now comes to us claiming that the prosecution
failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Specifically, he imputes the following errors to the court <i><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style="">:  </span>(1) in finding that he
shot and killed the victim when no clear evidence supports it; (2) in finding
that the deformed slug, Exh. “I,” was the same slug extracted from the cadaver
of the victim and basing <span style="">its </span>conviction
thereon; and, (3) in giving high probative value to the testimony of Pat.
Daniel Q. Omega notwithstanding his apparent bias for the victim who was his
superior in the police force.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the evidence for the prosecution is woven around the testimony
of Pat. Daniel Q. Omega who gave a detailed account of the incident.  On 4 May 1981, Pat. Omega was on duty at
Pier 1 in Catbalogan, Samar, from eleven o’clock in the evening to seven
o’clock the following morning.  At past
midnight, 5 May 1981, Pfc. Edino Ontuca, Officer-in-Charge of the Talalora
Police Sub-Station, approached him for assistance claiming he was maltreated by
strangers.  Pat. Omega responded and
both proceeded to where complainant was reportedly assaulted, passing by
Malayan Hotel at the pier area to get Ontuca’s service revolver.</p>

<p class="BODY">When they reached the corner of Rizal Avenue and Del Rosario
Street, the two (2) policemen saw three (3) men in the company of a woman.  Pat. Omega approached them, identified
himself as a police officer, and then began to investigate the reported <span style="">“<i>castigo</i>” </span>or manhandling of
complainant.  A certain C1C Belino spoke
for the group.  He introduced himself
first and then his companions, Maj. de la Cruz and Sgt. Padilla.  At that juncture, Pfc. Ontuca gave his name,
rank and position, and then remarked, “Why have you done this to me?  Brod, we are not adversaries; we are of the
same feather.” After saying this, Pat. Omega tapped Pfc. Ontuca’s shoulder and
admonished the latter saying, “Brod, let us stop; just keep silent; just go
home and sleep.”<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Pfc. Ontuca took the advice and returned to the pier with Pat. Omega.</p>

<p class="BODY">When they reached Malayan Hotel, Pfc. Ontuca stayed behind at the
entrance while Pat. Omega proceeded to the Lion’s Waiting Shed some fifty (50)
meters away.  Suddenly, there was a
commotion in front of the hotel.  Pfc.
Ontuca was being ganged up by three (3) men.  Pat. Omega then rushed towards the hotel where he saw his companion
already down on his right knee with both arms stretched behind him, his left
arm held by Maj. de la Cruz and his right by Sgt. Padilla, while C1C Belino
held him by the waist and took his service revolver away.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> Pat.
Omega tried to intervene but C1C Belino and Maj. de la Cruz poked their pistols
at him.  C1C Belino disarmed Pat. Omega
and handed over his service pistol to Maj. de la Cruz who then grabbed Omega by
the collar saying, “Let us go to the hospital because you are drunk.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Pat. Omega denied that he was drunk and reasoned out that he was
on duty at the pier and would be responsible if something went wrong at his
post.  But Maj. de la Cruz did not
listen to him; instead, he ordered Pat. Omega and Pfc. Ontuca to go to the
hospital.  The accused held the victim
at the back of his waist and at the collar of his shirt as they walked along
Del Rosario Street on their way to the hospital.  When they reached Lorenz Barber Shop, Maj. de la Cruz summoned a
certain Sgt. Bongosia to accompany them to the hospital purportedly in order to
have the two policemen undergo “liquor test.” Sgt. Bongosia obliged and then
cocked his armalite.  He even boasted
that he came from Mindanao and was not afraid of anyone.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All six (6), namely, Maj. de la Cruz, Pat. Omega, Pfc. Ontuca,
C1C Belino, Sgt. Bongosia and the accused then proceeded east along Curry Av<span style="">e</span>nue with the accused holding Pfc.
Ontuca, followed by Sgt. Bongosia and C1C Belino to their right, then Pat.
Omega and Maj. de la Cruz.  At the
intersection of Curry Avenue and San Bartolome Street, Pfc. Ontuca managed to
free himself from the grasp of the accused and ran north along San Bartolome
Street.  Upon reaching the intersection
of Rizal Avenue and San Bartolome Street, Pfc. Ontuca turned right,
eastward.  The accused, followed by Maj.
de la Cruz and Pat. Omega, pursued Pfc. Ontuca, while Sgt. Bongosia did not
take the same route; he ran straight along Curry Avenue and then turned left,
north, along San Francisco Street.  C1C
Belino dashed to the opposite direction, turning left towards Del Rosario
Street.  When Pfc. Ontuca reached a fruit
stand <span style="">beside Cinex </span>Theater, he
grabbed a girl named Lilia, an employee at the nearby Bahay Kawayan Disco
situated along Callejon, a narrow street connecting Rizal Avenue.  Lilia struggled and screamed for help as
Pfc. Ontuca held her tightly by the waist, using her as a human shield against
the accused who was pointing his pistol at him.  Finally, Pfc. Ontuca and Lilia fell to the ground giving the
latter a chance to escape.  Left without
any protection, Pfc. Ontuca squatted on the ground and reached for a piece of
plywood which he held upward to cover his head.</p>

<p class="BODY">Maj. de la Cruz and Pat. Omega were just across the street
standing in front of the Bonifacio Nardo Store some fifteen (15) meters
away.  From where they stood, they could
clearly see the side view of the accused and the victim facing each other.  The area was fairly illuminated from the
mercury lamp at the corner of Callejon and Rizal Avenue, from the light in the
gasoline station at the corner of San Francisco Street and Rizal Avenue, and
from the incandescent bulb at the Bonifacio Nardo Store.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. Ontuca begged for his life.  “I am not going to fight with you,” he said.  But the accused, showing no mercy, squeezed the trigger of his
.45 cal. automatic pistol pumping a single bullet into the head of his victim
who was just some three to four meters from him.  The time was exactly two o’clock in the morning.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
After shooting Pfc. Ontuca, the accused backtracked and then returned to the
fallen policeman and tauntingly kicked him saying, “Are you still alive?” The
accused then went to Maj. de la Cruz and talked to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some fifteen (15) minutes later, members of the military police
(MP) arrived aboard their jeep.  The MPs
requested Sgt. Padilla and Maj. de la Cruz to surrender their firearms but they
refused, so the two (2) were told to go with them to the barracks and surrender
their firearms to their Commanding Officer.  Maj. de la Cruz, Sgt. Padilla and Pat. Omega obliged and walked with the
MPs to the barracks.  The MPs then
loaded the victim, Pfc. Ontuca, in their jeep and brought him to the Samar
Provincial Hospital where he died the following day.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Sgt. Felix Padilla has a different version.  He says that at about one o’clock in the
morning of 5 May 1981, he was with the late Capt. Mario Ty and his men of the
9th Infantry Brigade.  They had just
arrived from a covert operation in Bgy. Rama, Catbalogan, Samar.  Upon their arrival at Pier 1 they parted
ways, he going to the house of his first cousin Monica Racuyal at the southwest
corner of Mabini Avenue and 7th Street, Patag District, while the rest of the
group proceeded to Calbayog City, home of his brigade.  He took San Bartolome Street then turned
right on Rizal Avenue walking along the right or southern side.  On the left or northern side of the street
near the Cinex Theater, he noticed a man forcing himself on a woman who was
struggling and screaming for help.  Being an officer of the law, he responded.  He identified himself and ordered the man to release the
woman.  The man ignored him and so he
fired a single warning shot into the air using his .45 cal. pistol.  Before he could even lower his arm, he heard
a gun report emanating some thirty (30) meters away near the intersection of
San Bartolome Street and Rizal Avenue where the Catbalogan Hardware was
located.</p>

<p class="BODY">At that very moment, the man holding the woman slumped to the
ground.  He then saw two (2) men from
the street corner beside the hardware store dart towards Rizal Avenue.  Immediately, he took cover behind a parked
jeep and called upon a bystander to summon the police.  From where he was, he heard someone near the
Catbalogan Hardware saying, “Patay na yan,” referring to the person who had
just been gunned down.  Members of the
military police soon arrived and took the victim to the hospital.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A painstaking review of the records fails to convince us that
somebody else shot the victim to death.  This Court gives credence to the contrary testimony of Pat. Daniel Omega
who narrated the events with elaborate details before, during and after the
shooting.  We are satisfied, as was the
trial court, with his story which rings true throughout.</p>

<p class="BODY">The account of the defense that the victim was shot at the head
by unidentified men is inconsistent with human experience, observation and
reason, and is further belied by the positive testimony of a principal
witness.  The improbability of
appellant’s narration lies principally on the admitted medical findings on the
point of entry of the bullet, the size of the gunshot wound and its
characteristics, as well as the location of the slug taken from the head of the
victim, all of which point to the culpability of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy report shows that the bullet entered the mid-parietal
region of the victim’s head where the left and the right parietal bones forming
part of the <u>upper portions of the skull</u> unite <span style="">or </span>are joined by a bony seam called the sagittal suture that
runs along a point anterior or above the forehead and a point posterior or
about the level of the ear.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> The
testimony of Dr. Caridad Quimbo, the resident physician who conducted the
post-mortem examination, as well as the diagram in the anatomical chart (Exh.
“H”) marking the entrance wound, reveals that the bullet entered the roof of
the skull and embedded itself beneath the left parietal bone.  From the location of the slug in relation to
the entry wound, it could be safely concluded, according to the doctor, that
the trajectory of the bullet took on a downward curve, inferring that the
assailant was on a higher plane than the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> She
also observed the bursting of the edges of the stellar shaped entrance wound
indicating that the bullet was fired at close range.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, the size of the gunshot wound - about 3-1/2 inches in diameter -
which caused the cerebral tissues to spill out from the cranium, was too large
for the bullet to have been fired from a distance of thirty (30) meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find it difficult to believe that the alleged gunman fired the
shot that hit the victim at the top of his head from his right side, while the latter
was at a distance struggling with a woman at the time he was hit.  Indeed, it is highly incredible<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
for a person with ordinary shooting skills to hit an extraordinary mark at a
range of thirty (30) meters using only a handgun, especially when the target is
mobile and the sight is blocked by some persons, and the area is not
comfortably lighted.  Even if the
shooting was accidental, or if purposely done was consigned to chance, the
probability that the bullet would fatally hit the victim was remarkably remote.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant takes issue on whether the slug marked Exh. “I”
could be considered by the court notwithstanding the failure of the prosecution
to formally offer it in evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> The
records show that when Fiscal Cobriros offered his evidence in court he
inadvertedly skipped Exh. “I.” After he offered Exh. “H” and its sub-markings,
he proceeded to offer Exh. <span style="">“J” </span>and
its sub-markings, thereby omitting to offer Exh. “I.” The accused maintains
that under Sec. 35, Rule 132, of the Rules of Court, evidence not formally
offered, such as Exh. “I,” cannot be considered by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is untenable.  Although Exh. “I” was not formally offered, it was nevertheless duly
identified by Ireneo Ordeano, Senior Ballistician of the NBI.  It was accordingly noted and subsequently
incorporated in the records.  Such
oversight could not be fatal to the cause of the prosecution as its entire
evidence had been recorded and the witness who was competent to testify on the
matter had properly identified the challenged exhibit.  But even without the exhibits incorporated
into the records, the prosecution can still establish its case as its principal
witness properly identified Exh. “I” and his testimony was recorded.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The most vital pieces of physical evidence of the prosecution - the copper
jacketed slug taken from the head of the victim and the empty shell recovered
from the scene of the crime - indubitably point to the accused as the author of
the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">To strengthen the theory of the prosecution that the slug taken
from the head of the victim was fired from the pistol of the accused, the
prosecution detailed the procedure followed by the ballistics expert of the PC
Crime Laboratory.  The evidence specimen
shell was marked “OCA” and the four (4) test specimen shells taken from four
(4) live ammunition which were test-fired into a bullet recovery box using the
pistol of the accused were marked “T-82-1” to “T-82-4.” The specimens were then
mounted on a special ballistics microscope.  On the left stage was placed the evidence specimen shell, while on the
right, the standard (test) specimen shell.  The microscope was so designed for comparing ballistics empty shells
with a single eyepiece where the examiner could view both specimens side by
side and thoroughly compare the impressions appearing thereon.  A photomicrograph was then taken of the
objects appearing on the lens of the microscope.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> The
results showed that the impressions on the evidence specimen shell were
identical with the impressions on the standard specimen.  On the basis of the result of the
examination, the ballistics expert of the PC Crime Laboratory concluded that
the evidence specimen shell and the standard specimen shells were fired from
one and the same firearm of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A ballistics examination on the deformed copper jacketed slug
marked Exh. <span style="">“I” </span>was also
conducted by the NBI.  Following the
same procedure adopted by the PC Crime Laboratory by comparing the evidence
copper jacketed slug narked Exh. “I” with the three standard slugs marked Exhs.
“L,” “L-1” and “L-2,” the NBI observed that the evidence copper jacketed slug
possesses identical characteristic markings with those of the standard
slugs.  The conclusion reached by the
NBI was that the bullets were fired from one and the same firearm.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
A photomicrograph was also taken of the specimens and they vividly showed
parallelism in the impressions.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant postulates that the evidence copper jacketed
slug marked Exh. “I” was not the same slug taken by the medico-legal officer
from the head of the <span style="">victim </span>during
the post-mortem examination.  According
to appellant, it was physically impossible to conduct a ballistics examination
on the evidence slug because it was in a “disintegrated form” and was
“fragmented in smaller bits” when taken out of the head of the <span style="">victim.  </span>The <span style="">accused </span>also
banks on the inconsistency between the finding of Dr. Quimbo that the evidence
slug was covered with a “bronze jacket” and the NBI ballistics expert who said
that the slug was coated with a “copper jacket.”<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the records to show that the evidence copper
jacket was splintered into several pieces when it was taken out of the head of
the deceased.  Neither is there evidence
on record to show that the evidence slug examined by the NBI ballistics expert
is different from that extracted by Dr. Quimbo from the victim.  The ballistics report of the NBI
Criminalistics Division showed that the evidence slug submitted for examination
on 24 February 1984 in <i><span style="">People v.
Sgt. Felix Padilla</span></i><span style=""> was </span><u>one-piece
deformed copper jacketed slug</u> fired from a .45 cal. pistol, and not a
fragmented slug.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant should not rely on the recollection of Dr.
Quimbo as to the form or shape of the evidence slug.  The post-mortem examination on the body of the victim was made
more than a year before Dr. Quimbo testified and she herself admitted that she
was no longer certain on the shape or form of the evidence slug<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
as she was more concerned with the post-mortem examination of the cadaver and
not with forensic ballistics examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, accused-appellant asserts that the testimony of Pat.
Omega should not have been accepted with precipitate credulity since the
witness was too partial for the victim who was his superior in the police
force.  This argument is patently flawed.  The credibility of a principal witness is a
perennial object of attack by an accused in distress who endlessly fabricates
convenient tales and incredible notions to impugn a particularly damaging
testimony.  We quote with approval the
observation of the Solicitor General<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> -</p>

<blockquote>There is not a whit of truth to this claim considering that Ontuca
was already dead at the time Pat. Omega gave testimony of the criminal
incident.  Moreover, the defense has
shown no motive for personal or financial gain on the part of Pat. Omega when
he testified and provided the trial court with the facts on the commission of
the crime.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as the trial judge observed of the deportment of
principal witness Pat. Omega:  “Omega is
a peace officer.  He testified in a
straightforward manner.  His testimony
has the ring of truth.  No credible
reason has been given why said witness would testify except to tell the truth.”</p>

<p class="BODY">While we affirm the conviction of accused?appellant, we
take exception to the findings of the court <i>a </i><i><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>on the
attendant circumstances.  We do not
agree that there was treachery in the killing of the victim to qualify it to
murder.  There was no treachery or <i>alevosia</i>
because the accused did not deliberately employ means, methods or forms in the
mode of his attack which tended directly and specially to insure his safety
from any offensive or retaliatory act the victim might make.  Appellant did not consciously adopt a
particular method or manner of killing the victim <span style="">that </span>would eliminate any risk to himself, for it was not until
Pfc. Ontuca and the woman he was holding hostage accidentally fell to the
ground that appellant was accorded the instant opportunity to kill his victim
with facility.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the early case of <b>People v. Cañete</b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that “[t]he circumstance that the deceased had fallen to the ground
gave to the accused, it is true, the opportunity, of which he promptly availed
himself, to come up with the deceased and to dispatch him at once.  But that act of so doing cannot be
interpreted as evincing a design to employ a method indicative of <i><span style="">alevosia</span></i><span style="">.  </span>The contrary is true
in the case where the victim is bound before being slain or is driven to take
refuge behind the closed door of a closet.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the assault on the victim was not made in a sudden and
unexpected manner.  Pfc. Ontuca
apparently sensed the sinister plan of his malefactors when he fled and
forcibly took a woman hostage to use as a human shield.  Clearly, the victim was forewarned of a
graver evil when accused and his companions mauled him, and when Maj. de la
Cruz had to summon an armed military man purportedly to bring him and Pat.
Omega to the hospital for a “liquor test.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of treachery or <i><span style="">alevosia</span></i><span style=""> </span>notwithstanding,
the crime committed by accused-appellant is still murder.  The killing was qualified by the aggravating
circumstance of abuse of superior strength which was alleged in the information
and proved during the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Abuse of superior strength is present not only when the offenders enjoy
numerical superiority, or there is a notorious inequality of forces between the
victim and the aggressor, but also when the offender uses a powerful weapon
which is out of proportion to the defense available to the offended party.  The accused was armed with a powerful pistol
which he purposely used, gaining him an advantage over his victim who only had
a piece of plywood to cover himself after he was disarmed.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused did not abuse his public position in committing the
crime.  For this circumstance to be
appreciated as aggravating, the public official must use his influence,
prestige and ascendancy which his office gives him in realizing his
purpose.  It could not be said that the
accused purposely used or took advantage of his position or rank in killing the
victim because he could have committed the crime just the same by using another
weapon not necessarily his service firearm.  Besides, Pfc. Ontuca, himself a military man, resisted the assault on
his person and did not adhere to the accused, nor to C1C Belino, neither to
Maj. de la Cruz, who was a ranking officer of the Philippine Air Force.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sufficient provocation could neither mitigate the criminal
liability of the accused.  He cannot
claim that he was provoked by Pfc. Ontuca when the latter ran away from him
because, understandably so, the hapless victim feared for his life having been
beaten up twice by his assailants that same evening.  To flee when danger lurks is human and can never be regarded as a
source of provocation sufficient to come within the ambit of The Revised Penal
Code.  In fact, when an offended party
flees from his aggressor, the latter has no reason to pursue and attack him.</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, the crime committed by accused-appellant is murder
qualified by abuse of superior strength.  The penalty for murder <span style="">is </span><i><span style="">reclusion temporal</span></i><span style=""> </span>maximum to death.  In the absence of any mitigating or
aggravating circumstance, the penalty should be, as correctly imposed by the
court <i><span style="">a quo, reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style="">, </span>which is the penalty for murder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the court <i><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>finding accused-appellant SGT. FELIX PADILLA guilty of murder
and imposing upon him the penalty of <i><span style="">reclusion
perpetua</span></i><span style=""> </span>is <span style="">AFFIRMED, </span>with the modification that
the civil indemnity of P30,000.00 awarded to the heirs of the deceased Pfc.

The autopsy conducted on the remains of the victim by Dr. Caridad Quimbo,
Senior Resident Physician at the Samar Provincial Hospital, shows the
following:  “A.   External:   Extremities - contusion on the left wrist and on the right cubital
fossa; Head - a) Gunshot wound, with point of entry at the midparietal
region.  There is bursting of the edges
of the entrance wound, assuming a stellar shape, and measuring 3 1/2 inches along
its widest diameter.  Part of the
cerebral tissue can be seen extruded from the wound; b) Hematoma on the left
parietal region of the head.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">B.   Internal:  Head - Fracture
of the underlying parietal bones of the segittal suture.  The bronze jacket of the slug was lodged
beneath the parietal bone, close to the entrance wound x x x x The lead
component of the slug was recovered on the left parietal region, beneath the
fractured left parietal bone, and surrounded by hematoma.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Immediate Cause, of Death:  Cardio-respiratory arrest secondary to
laceration of the cerebral tissue.”</p>
