				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court,
Branch 49, Palawan and Puerto Princesa City, in Criminal Case No. 7852, finding
the six appellants, all members of the same family, guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of Murder.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">The information filed against appellants reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 19th day of November 1988, at Sitio
Suring, Barangay Pangabilian, Municipality of Brooke's Point, Province of
Palawan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping
one another, with evident premeditation and treachery, with intent to kill, all
armed with deadly weapons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, suddenly attack, assault and shoot with their air-gun, hack with
their bolos and stab with their sharp-pointed bamboo sticks (sibat), one
VINCENT BROWN hitting him in the vital parts of his body and inflicting upon
him the following injuries, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 1.8pt;">1.  Hack wound on the left forearm;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: 0in;">2.  Lacerated wound on the left eye­brow and
foot;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: 0in;">3.  Gunshot wound on the right infra-orbital
area and on the left chest;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: 0in;">4.  Multiple lacerations and contusions at the
back,</p>

<blockquote>all causing hemorrhage and collapsed lungs
which were the direct and immediate cause of his instantaneous death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the commission of the crime by the above-named accused was
aggravated by the following circumstances:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All the accused have taken advantage of
their superior strength; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That there is a presence of evident
premeditation and treachery.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised
Penal Code, as amended" (Rollo, pp. 33-34).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At their arraignment, appellants pleaded not guilty.  After trial, the court rendered a decision,
convicting appellants and disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court found and so finds all accused guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER, defined and penalized under
Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code as principal by direct participation,
with a mitigating circumstance of minority with respect to accused Ricky and
Richard Daguinutan.  Accused Inocentes,
Melchor, Edgar and Nenita Daguinutan are sentenced to suffer RECLUSION
PERPETUA.  While Ricky and Richard
Daguinutan are sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of Ten (10) years and One
(1) day of Prision Mayor to Seventeen (17) years and Four (4) months of
Reclusion Temporal, to indemnify the heirs of Vincent Brown the amount of Three
Million Four Hundred Fifty-Six Thousand (P3,456,000.00) Pesos for his unearned
income, Thirty-Five Thousand Five-Hundred (P35,500.00) Pesos for funeral
expenses and other incidental services; Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos for
moral damages and Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) for exemplary damages, without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs" (Rollo, pp.
49-50).</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence favorable to the prosecution, as found by the trial
court, shows that the victim, Vincent Brown, bought a parcel of land from
Delfin Lim.  It so happened that
Inocentes Daguinutan and his wife, Nenita, also wanted to buy the same parcel
of land and they deposited the amount of P10,000.00 with Lim for that
purpose.  A deed of sale was later
executed by Lim in favor of Brown.  The
deposit of the spouses Daguinutans was given by Lim to Brown, with instructions
to return it to them.  Although the
couple got back their deposit, and even finished harvesting their crops on the
land as allowed them by Brown, the Daguinutans still persisted to stay thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that fateful day of November 19, 1988, Brown with two
companions, Alfredo Romero and Eduardo Pacheco, went to the land he bought from
Lim to plant coconut seedlings.  Inocentes and Nenita Daguinutan went to the place where Brown was
working and chided him for reneging on his promise that he would first file a
complaint in court before ejecting them.  Brown told the couple that he would institute the necessary court
proceedings.  Thereafter, Nenita called
her four children, Melchor, Edgar, Richard and Ricky, saying "Come on,
Come here, let us carry our plan to kill Mr. Brown." Melchor then fired
his airgun three times.  Richard and
Edgar hacked the victim, while Ricky speared him.  Nenita was the first one who hacked Brown at the back while the
latter was fighting with Inocentes (TSN, April 11, 1989, pp. 14-15).  When the victim fell down, appellants
continued to spear him.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellants reiterated their claim that it was
Inocentes Daguinutan who killed Brown in self-defense.  They refuted the findings of the trial court
that they had a motive to kill Brown because the spouses Daguinutans had been
bested in the rivalry for the purchase of the land from Lim and that they acted
with treachery in killing the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommended the acquittal of all
appellants, except Inocentes, pointing out:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">(1)<span style=""> </span>That the physical evidence negates the finding
of the trial court that appellants "ganged up" on Brown (Rollo, p.
150); and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That it is contrary to human nature that
a mother would expose her young children to a grave peril and rally them to
engage in a deadly combat, such as a "bolo" fight with three armed
men (Rollo, p. 152).</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the Solicitor General, if the six appellants, acting
in concert, really "ganged up" on Brown, the latter would have
sustained more and graver wounds than the ones mentioned in the autopsy
report.  Moreover, he would have been so
overwhelmed by the combined strength of his assailants as to disable him from
inflicting the hacking wounds on Inocentes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, there was no evidence showing that the Daguinutans had
foreknowledge that Brown would go to the disputed land that morning of November
19, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot rely on the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses.  Romero was the caretaker of
the house of Brown in Cainta, Rizal, while Pacheco is the husband of a niece of
Brown.  The two were brought to Palawan
just three days before the incident in question.  Romero claimed that Nenita was the first to hack Brown at the
back (TSN, April 11, 1989, pp. 14-15).  Both Romero and Pacheco also testified that Ricky speared Brown at the
back.</p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy report of Dr. Narciso Leoncio did not show any
serious wounds, much less any stab or hack wounds at the back of Brown.  The wounds were:</p>

<blockquote>“a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hacking wound on (L) forearm posterior
area about 20 cm. in sizes, involving the large vessel;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lacerated
wound<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1)  (L) eyebrow about 3 cm</blockquote>

<blockquote>  2)  (R) foot solar area about 2-3 cm.;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Multiple
<u>superficial</u> <u>laceration</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>back</u> with
contusions;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  d)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gunshot
wound<span style=""> </span>1)  POE (R) infraorbital area dissected and collected the bullets</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)  POE (L) chest at the level of 4th rib, point
of exit (R) posterior axillary line" (Rollo, p. 39; Underlining supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In evaluating the evidence on the claim of the prosecution that
appellants simultaneously attacked Brown from all sides, we should not discount
the fact that Brown had two companions, who served as his bodyguards, and the
three were armed with a "piko," a shovel and a grass cutter.  Romero, on cross-examination, admitted that
he did not see the children of Inocentes when the latter and his wife
confronted Brown.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nature of the wounds sustained by Edgar lends credence to his
version that he was not able to get near <span style="">Brown
</span>because he was intercepted by Romero and Pacheco, who delivered hacking
blows on him (TSN, November 22, 1989, pp. 4-5).  According to Dr. Nieto H. Gepigon, Edgar suffered the following
injuries:   "(1) incised wound about
one inch long; non-penetrating, involves superficial muscle on (R) anterior
axilla; (2) incised wound about two inches traversely on scapular region; (3)
incised wound (R) upper mid-back involving muscles, non-penetrating traversely
about three-and-a-half inches long; and (4) lineal abrasion longitudinally
back, spinal region" (TSN, Oct. 11, 1989, pp. 7-8).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is hard to believe the claim of Brown's two companions, Romero
and <span style="">Pacheco, </span>that they simply
watched appellants attack Brown, without coming to his aid.</p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore agree with the Solicitor General that conspiracy was
not established and that the guilt of Nenita and her four children was not
proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to the admission of Inocentes that he was the one
who killed Brown but that he did so in self-defense.  With this admission, the burden of proving self-defense shifts to
him (People v. Picardal, 151 SCRA 170 [1989]).  In doing so, he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on
the weakness of the evidence of the prosecution (People <span style="">v. </span>Taloboc, 30 SCRA 87 [1969]).  He must establish his claim by clear and convincing evidence (Andres <span style="">v. </span>Court of Appeals, 151 SCRA 268
[1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">For self-defense to exist, three requisites must be complied
with, to wit:   (1) unlawful aggression;
(2) reasonable necessity of the means <span style="">employed
</span>to repel it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the
person defending himself (People v. Molina, 213 SCRA 52 (1992); People v.
Batas, 176 SCRA 46 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the unlawful aggression, Inocentes testified:   (1) that when he saw his wife being chased by
Brown, he rushed to her aid; (2) that Brown shifted his attention to him; that
when he saw Brown armed with small kris, he fled; and (3) that Brown chased him
and hacked him at the back (TSN, Nov. 28, 1989, pp. 1-15).</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical findings belie the claim of Inocentes that he was the
victim of an unlawful aggression by Brown.  According to the Medico Legal Slip (Exh. 10), executed by Dr. Nieto H.
Gepigon, Inocentes suffered the following injuries:   "(1) Incised wound (R) eyebrow superficial transversely about
2 cm.; (2) small lacerated wound - 1 cm. at lateral portion canthus (R) eye;
and (3) contusion hematoma (R) eye, including conjuctial - with a duration of
ten (10) days."</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical report of the examination conducted by Dr. Gepigon did
not mention any wound on the back of Inocentes, much less a wound caused by a
kris.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the necessity of the means employed to repel the unlawful
aggression, Inocentes testified that after he was hit on the back by the kris
of Brown, he hit Brown with his airgun.  Inasmuch as Brown continued to advance, Inocentes fired two more shots
from the airgun.  As testified to by Dr.
Leoncio, the one who conducted the autopsy on the body of Brown, the gunshot
wounds on the infra-orbital area, were fatal (Rollo, p. 108).</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted by the Solicitor General, such gunshot wounds could have
been enough to disable Brown.  Dr.
Leoncio testified that the gunshot wounds caused the collapse of the lungs and
sudden death of Brown five minutes later (Rollo, p. 108).  There was no need therefore for Inocentes to
hack Brown with a bolo after his airgun ran out of pellets.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third element of self-defense is that there was no sufficient
provocation by the person defending himself.  In the natural order of things, the one who was deeply offended by the
acts of his adversary is deemed to be the one who struck the first blow (U.S.
v. Laurel, 22 Phil. 252 [1912]).  Inocentes was the one grievously offended by the entry of Brown into the
disputed land without asking permission from Inocentes, who still claimed the
right of possession of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of conviction of the trial court
is REVERSED insofar as appellants Nenita, Melchor, Richard, Edgar and Ricky,
all surnamed Daguinutan, are concerned and all of them are ACQUITTED of the
crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED, with respect to Inocentes
Daguinutan, with the MODIFICATION that the offense committed is Homicide, and
he is sentenced to suffer <span style="">an </span>indeterminate
penalty of SIX (6) YEARS AND ONE DAY of <u><span style="">Prision</span></u><span style=""> <u>Mayor</u>
to </span>FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS AND <span style="">ONE (1) DAY of <u>Reclusion</u> <u>Temporal.</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>
