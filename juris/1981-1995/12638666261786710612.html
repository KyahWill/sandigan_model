domain was filed on <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1986</st1:date>,
docketed as Civil Case No. 13699.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Attached to petitioner's complaint was a certification that a bank
account (Account No. S/A 265-537154-3) had been opened with the PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch under petitioner's name containing the sum
of P417,510.00, made pursuant to the provisions of Pres. Decree No. 42.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After due hearing where the parties presented
their respective appraisal reports regarding the value of the property,
respondent RTC judge rendered a decision on June 4, 1987, fixing the appraised
value of the property at P5,291,666.00, and ordering petitioner to pay this
amount minus the advanced payment of P338,160.00 which was earlier released to
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">After this decision became final and
executory, private respondent moved for the issuance of a writ of
execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>granted by respondent RTC
judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After issuance of the writ of
execution, a Notice of Garnishment dated <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1988</st1:date> was served by respondent sheriff <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Pastrana</span> upon the
manager of the PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, respondent sheriff was informed that
a "hold code" was placed on the account of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result of this, private respondent filed
a motion dated <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1988</st1:date>
praying that an order be issued directing the bank to deliver to respondent
sheriff the amount equivalent to the unpaid balance due under the RTC decision
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">Petitioner filed a motion to lift the
garnishment, on the ground that the manner of payment of the expropriation
amount should be done in installments which the respondent RTC judge failed to
state in his decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent filed its opposition to the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">Pending resolution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of </span>the above motions, petitioner filed
on <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1988</st1:date> a
"Manifestation" informing the court that private respondent was no
longer the true and lawful owner of the subject property because a new title
over the property had been registered in the name of Philippine Savings Bank,
Inc. (PSB).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent RTC judge issued
an order requiring PSB to make available the documents pertaining to its
transactions over the subject property, and the PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>
Branch to reveal the amount in petitioner's account which was garnished by
respondent sheriff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with
this order, PSB filed a manifestation informing the court that it had
consolidated its ownership over the property as mortgagee/purchaser at an extra-judicial
foreclosure sale held on <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="4">April 20,
 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After several
conferences, PSB and private respondent entered into a compromise agreement
whereby they agreed to divide between themselves the compensation due from the
expropriation proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">Respondent trial judge subsequently
issued an order dated September 8, 1988 which: (1) approved the compromise
agreement; (2) ordered PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch to
immediately release to PSB the sum of P4,953,506.45 which corresponds to the
balance of the appraised value of the subject property under the RTC decision
dated June 4, 1987, from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">the </span>garnished
account of petitioner; and, (3) ordered PSB and private respondent to execute
the necessary deed of conveyance over the subject property in favor of
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>lift the garnishment was<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">Petitioner filed a motion for
reconsideration, which was duly opposed by private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, for failure of the manager

show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why he should not be held in contempt of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>During the hearings conducted for the above motions, the general manager
of the PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch, a Mr.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>Antonio Bautista, informed the court
that he was still waiting for proper authorization from the PNB head office
enabling him to make a disbursement for the amount so ordered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For its part, petitioner contended that its
funds at the PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch could neither be
garnished nor levied upon execution, for to do so would result in the
disbursement of public funds without the proper appropriation required under
the law, citing the case of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Republic</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">Respondent trial judge issued an order
dated <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1988</st1:date>
denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration on the ground that the doctrine
enunciated in <u>Republic</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Palacio</u></span>
did not apply to the case because petitioner's PNB Account No. S/A 265-537154-3

contempt of court for his inexcusable refusal to obey the order dated <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1988</st1:date>, and thus ordered
his arrest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and </span>detention until

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner

promulgated on June 28, 1989, the Court of Appeals dismissed both petitions for
lack of merit, </span>sustained the jurisdiction of respondent RTC judge over
the funds contained in petitioner's PNB Account No. 265-537154-3, and affirmed
his authority to levy on such funds.</p>
