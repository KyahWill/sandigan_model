The condemnation that attends the commission of the crime of rape is 
never as severe as when the offended party is below twelve years of age.
  A recent expression of such an attitude is found in the opening 
sentence of the <em>ponencia </em>of Justice Abad Santos in People v. Malate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  in these words:  "There should be a special place in hell for child 
molesters for they are men who are dirty, despicable, deviable and the 
dregs of society."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  There 
is all the more reason, therefore, for this Court in reviewing a 
conviction for such offense to satisfy itself that it is supported by 
proof of the clearest and most unequivocal character.  Considering 
further that in this appeal, outside of the fact that the victim is 
below the age of consent, the accused is the stepfather of the hapless 
girl, it is even more imperative that the conflicting testimonies be 
subjected to the most thorough and exhaustive analysis.  As will be 
shown, there is nothing in the competent and credible evidence of record
 to justify a reversal of the conviction of appellant Pedro Egot for the
 crime of rape, for which he was sentenced to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the offended party in the amount of ten thousand pesos (P10,000).
<p>
In the decision now on appeal, the lower court first set forth the 
testimony of the offended party as well as of the resident physician of 
Rizal Memorial Hospital of Dapitan City, a certain Dra. Filipinas S. 
Nielo, and thereafter, the testimony of the accused, now appellant Egot.
  After such narration, the decision went on to state:  "The physical 
evidence shows that the complainant has been raped.  She charged her 
stepfather of raping her once on the night of December 23, 1971 and 
again on the night of December 27, 1971.  It is very difficult for this 
court to believe that this 11 year-old girl, of average mentality, would
 invent the [charge] against her own stepfather whom she considered as 
her father if it were not true that she was abused by the latter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  In the appealed decision, there was also a summary of the testimony of
 complainant Ligaya de la Cruz.  She stated that on December 23, 1971, 
appellant with his one-year old son, Jose Egot, together with her and 
her sister Heidee, one year younger, she being at that time eleven, were
 in their house in Barra, Dipolog City.  Her mother was at the time in 
Dumaguete City convalescing after a tumor operation.  Late that night, 
she was awakened by the weight of a man on top of her.  She recognized 
him as her stepfather, appellant Egot.  She struggled and tried to 
extricate herself, but she was overpowered.  Nor was she able to shout 
for help as he held her by the neck and threatened to choke her.  Thus, 
he was able to consummate the sexual act.  At the time of the coition 
and afterwards, he repeatedly threatened to kill her if she revealed to 
anybody what happened.  That was the reason why for sometime, she could 
not reveal what was done to her on that night and on December 27, when 
again he abused her sexually.  In the evening of April 24, 1972, 
however, her mother saw appellant inside her mosquito net.  Her mother's
 suspicion was thus aroused.  Complainant was then asked questions, 
prompting her to relate her sordid experience with appellant.  On May 
15, 1972, she was examined by Dr. Filipinas Nielo, resident physician of
 the Rizal Memorial Hospital in Dapitan City.  The medical certificate 
showed the following findings:  “‘(1) Vagina admits 1 finger freely.  
(2) Old lacerations at 6, 12, 3 o'clock.  Note:  Vaginal smear for sperm
 cell taken - negative.’"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  
There was also testimony that the old lacerations of the hymen at 6:00 
o'clock, 3:00 o'clock and 12:00 o'clock positions on the face of a clock
 could have been caused by the insertion of a male organ into the 
private parts about five (5) months before the examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  The lower court could thus conclude:  "<em>These
 findings of the medical examiner which indicated that the injuries 
suffered by the complainant [occurred] some five months before 
examination confirmed the claim of the complainant that she was raped in
 the month of December, 1971 or five months before May 15, 1972</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  There is, moreover, persuasive force to this paragraph in the appealed
 decision:  "The accused did not present any other witness.  He did not 
present Romy Ranila whom he claimed slept with him in their house on the
 night of December 23, 1971, when Ligaya and her sister Heidee allegedly
 left the house and did not return that night.  He also did not present 
Marievic Cuevas who is his next door neighbor to confirm his claim that 
Ligaya went with Marievic Cuevas in the evening of December 23, 1971."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
There is, as is quite apparent from the above, more than sufficient 
support for the judgment of conviction.  The constitutional presumption 
of innocence,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  the ground on which this appeal is based, has thus been overcome.  To repeat, affirmance is indicated.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  It is of the essence of the accusatorial system grounded in 
the due process school of criminology that there be moral certainty of 
guilt to offset the constitutional presumption of innocence.  It follows
 then that to justify conviction no doubt could reasonably be 
entertained as to the fact of an offense having been committed precisely
 by the person on trial. "Accusation," to recall People v. Dramayo,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 "is not, according to the fundamental law, synonymous with guilt.  It 
is incumbent on the prosecution to demonstrate that culpability lies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
 Appellant contends that there was no compliance with such a standard.  
Counsel in the three-page brief filed with this Court assigned as the 
lone error the failure to overcome the constitutional presumption of 
innocence there being no proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  He 
argued that appellant could not have committed the crime imputed to him 
as he "appears [to be] a good family man and provider, having amassed 
some properties and had built 2 houses for his family; "is a likeable 
fellow, too, [having married] his widowed wife twice, first at a civil 
ceremony, and later at the Roman Catholic Church; * * *."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> There is clearly a <em>non sequitur</em>
 in this submission.  The fact that appellant is endowed with such 
sterling qualities hardly justifies the conclusion that he did not 
inflict on his stepdaughter the act imputed to him.  To cast doubt on 
the sufficiency of evidence submitted by the prosecution, counsel 
referred to the complaint for rape having been "filed about five months 
after the alleged commission of the crime [with such] delay not credibly
 explained."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  In appellee's brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> there was an admission of such "delay in the filing of the case."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 It was explained why: "On April 24, 1972, Ligaya dela Cruz told her 
mother what happened to her on December 23, 1971.  On May 15, 1972 
Ligaya was examined by Dr. Nielo.  On September 28, 1973 the complaint 
for rape was filed with the Office of the City Fiscal of Dipolog.  
Ligaya's silence from December 23, 1971 to April 24, 1972 was due to her
 fear of the accused, who threatened her with death and who 
unquestionably had moral ascendance over her and to her tender age.  As 
to why the complaint was filed only on September 28, 1973 despite the 
fact that Angela Recentes [mother of complainant] learned of her 
daughter's misfortune as early as April 24, 1972, the reason was that 
Angela must have thought of the grave consequence that might befall 
accused and her family should she then report the matter to the police 
authorities.  She gave accused a chance to reform, to which act of 
charity, accused reacted by maltreating his benefactor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 In his effort to cast doubt on the sufficiency of the evidence, counsel
 next attacked the character of the mother thus: "Defendant-appellant's 
wife who instigated the filing of the case here is evidently without 
scruples and not morally irreproachable herself as shown by the 
following:  (a) She is said to have a 'paramour'; and (b) She left the 
conjugal home with the pretext of buying goods with which to replenish 
the stocks of their sari-sari store, returning only after 6 days without
 any purchase made; and again, with the pretext of buying clothes to 
sell, she left the conjugal home May 1, 1972 and returned only on May 8,
 1972, again without bringing home anything.  These escapades do not sit
 well as against a woman said to have a paramour."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
  As in the two other previous arguments, the persuasive force appears 
to be nil.  It would be an affront to reason to conclude that just 
because the mother has a paramour, she concocted this charge against 
appellant.  That is no way to refute the indubitable fact that the 
11-year old girl had been deflowered at about the period alleged by her 
in her testimony as corroborated by the medical certificate of Dra. 
Nielo.  It cannot be reasonably doubted then that appellant is guilty as
 charged.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  The futility of this appeal is thus apparent.  Complainant 
testified that she resisted the indecent assault of appellant.  She did 
not have to do so.  As pointed out in People v. Conchada:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
 "Nor can there be any weight accorded to the observation made in the 
brief that complainant apparently failed to manifest any resistance to 
the sexual abuse committed on her person.  Thus, in People v. De la 
Cruz, this Court, through Justice Aquino, stated:  'Appellant's attempt 
to discredit complainant's story by observing that she had "made no 
outcry" during the commission of the crime or immediately thereafter 
does not deserve serious consideration.  In the rape of a girl below 
twelve years of age force or intimidation need not be present.' Again, 
through the same ponente, there is this holding in the subsequent case 
of People v. Gonzales:  'The crime committed by Gonzales is simple rape 
or rape without the attendance of any of the qualifying circumstances 
mentioned in article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.  Its basic element 
is the carnal knowledge of a girl below twelve years of age.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  In the decision now on appeal, the appellant was sentenced to serve the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 and to indemnify the victim in the sum of ten thousand pesos 
(P10,000.00).  Reference was therein made, however, to the testimony of 
the complainant that she was raped a second time by appellant on 
December 27, 1971.  If there were a definite finding that such indeed 
was the case, then two penalties of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> ought to
 have been imposed and the indemnification should have been double the 
amount, two offenses having been committed.  When, therefore, only one 
penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> was imposed, it must have been 
because the lower court did not give credence to the statement of the 
complainant that rape was once again committed on December 27, 1971.  
When she testified on direct examination, most of the questions asked by
 private prosecutor dealt with what happened on December 23, 1971.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
 The reference to what allegedly took place on December 27 was based on 
bare assertions in answer to a slightly leading question as to whether 
the rape on December 23, 1971 was the first and the last time.  She 
replied: "No, he did it again, Sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> When asked as to when was the second time, she answered: "On December 27, Sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>
 Also, when the complainant was asked likewise on direct examination 
whether on December 27, 1971, her mother was still in Dumaguete City or 
was back in their house in Barra, Dipolog City, her answer was: "She was
 already here."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  On cross-examination, she again reiterated that her mother returned on or before December 27, 1971.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
  On December 23 with her mother away, it is easily understandable why 
rape could have been perpetrated, but on December 27, with her mother in
 the house, it is not easy to lend full weight and credit to the bare 
assertion that she was raped a second time.  That seems to be the 
thinking too of the Office of the Solicitor General.  In the brief 
submitted for appellee, in its counter-statement of facts, there was no 
reference whatsoever to the alleged rape on December 27, 1977.  That 
accounts for its plea that the decision be affirmed, except for the 
modification that indemnification be increased to twelve thousand pesos 
(P12,000.00).
