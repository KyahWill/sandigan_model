<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The resolution of the

true nature of the action filed by the private respondents in the court

not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, jurisdiction having

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A careful examination of
the complaint shows that while the second cause of action </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">purely civil in nature and hence within the general jurisdiction of
regular courts, the first cause of action arose from the employer-employee
relationship of petitioner PLDT and the </span>respondents-employees and
therefore outside of the jurisdiction of respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Private respondents claim
that the two causes of action "while apparently separate are in fact
linked to </span>each other in the sense that what led to the employment of
respondents-employees in the petitioner PLDT was precisely the death of their
father Jose <span class="SpellE">Mayordo</span>" and therefore they should
be tried in the same proceeding before the respondent court [Memorandum for
Respondents, p. 18; <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rollo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, p. 241.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This argument is
unmeritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The two causes of action
are independent of each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that respondents in their second cause of action also claim damages for the
untimely death of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mayordo</span> does not affect the
true nature of the first cause of action as one arising from employer-employee
relations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If at all the two causes of
action are connected, it is but a tenuous connection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The determination of the merits of one cause
of action does not affect that of the other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In any case, private
respondents' second cause of action has already prescribed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1146 of the Civil Code explicitly
provides that actions upon an injury to the right of the plaintiff and upon a
quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> must be instituted within four years
from the time the cause of </span>action accrued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents' right of action against
PLDT for the death of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mayordo</span> prescribed on <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1978</st1:date>, four (4) years after
his death, while the complaint below was filed only on <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They cannot now hope to erase the effect of
prescription by merely joining their claim for damages for the death of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mayordo</span> with their claim for damages for the suspension
and/or dismissal of <span class="GramE">respondents</span> employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, private respondents are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from claiming damages for the death of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mayordo</span>
since, by their own admission, they already received from PLDT the sum of nine
thousand pesos (P9,000.00) as indemnity for the death of Jose <span class="SpellE">Mayordo</span> [Complaint, p. 3; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>
p. 20.]</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the first cause of action, private respondents cannot rely

that the case falls within the jurisdiction of the regular court and not the
Labor Arbiters of the NLRC.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Quisaba</u></span> case a
distinction was drawn between <u>the</u> <u>right</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>employer</u>
<u>to</u> <u>dismiss</u> <u>an</u> <u>employee</u>, which is within the
competence of labor agencies to pass upon and <u>the</u> <u>manner</u> <u>in</u>
<u>which</u> <u>the</u> <u>right</u> <u>was</u> <u>exercised</u>, declared to
be intrinsically civil and cognizable only by the regular courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This doctrine has been abandoned by this
Court in a number of cases subsequent to <span class="SpellE"><u>Quisaba</u></span>
[Atlas Fertilizer Corporation v. Navarro, G.R. No. 72074, April 30, 1987, 149

<p class="BODY">However, it was only in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Primero</u></span>
<u>v</u>. <u>IAC</u>, <u>supra</u>, where the Court categorically stated its
intention to abandon the <span class="SpellE"><u>Quisaba</u></span>
doctrine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court held that the
distinction laid down in <span class="SpellE"><u>Quisaba</u></span> is tenuous
and difficult to observe and that the question of the <u>legality</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>act</u> <u>of</u> <u>dismissal</u> is intimately related to the
issue of the <u>legality</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>manner</u> by which that
act of <span class="SpellE">dismisal</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was
</span>performed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the
issue of whether or not moral or other damages were suffered by an employee and
in the affirmative, the amount to be awarded to him is determined by the Civil
Code provisions on torts and damages and not the Labor <span class="GramE">Code,</span>
was not meant to create <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>cause
of action independent of that for illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever tribunal exercises jurisdiction over
the question of illegal dismissal also has jurisdiction over claims for moral
and exemplary damages arising from such dismissal [<span class="SpellE"><u>Primero</u></span>,
<u>supra</u> at 445.] Furthermore, respondents in this case are not only
challenging the <u>manner</u> by which PLDT exercised its right to dismiss its
employees but also the <u>validity</u> of the suspension and threatened
dismissal of respondents-employees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Private respondents also
contend that even assuming that the claim for damages arose from the
employer-employee relations of PLDT and respondents-employees, the regular
court still has jurisdiction over the case because pursuant to Presidential
Decree No. 1367, which was the law prevailing at the time the complaint was
filed, the NLRC had no jurisdiction over claims for moral damages and other
forms of damages which is precisely the nature of the claims in their first
cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argue that “</span>matters
arising from the injustice and unfairness committed by an employer against an
employee . . . matters about the manner such an employee is treated and its
effects, and matters about moral damages and other forms of damages are
definitely beyond the cognizance now of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the

<p class="BODY">The law governing jurisdiction over cases involving claims for
damages arising from employer-employee relations is Article 217 of the Labor
Code (Pres. Decree 442).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to its

<p class="BODY">In at least four (4) cases the Court has declared that P.D. No.
1691 is a curative statute with retrospective application to pending
proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the cases of <u>Getz</u>

the Court applied P.D. No. 1691 to cases filed during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of P.D. No. 1367.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the more recent case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Abad</u></span> <u>v</u>.

</span><u>Court</u></span> <u>of</u> <u>Manila</u> G.R. No. 65505, <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1987</st1:date>, 154 SCRA 664] the
Court upheld the decision of the lower court giving retroactive application to
P.D. No. 1691.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court said:</p>

<blockquote>However, whereas before jurisdiction over money claims of laborers
and employees appertained to Courts of First Instance, the same are now to be
taken cognizance of by proper authorities in the Department of Labor and
Employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>The</u> <u>rule</u> <u>of</u> <u>adherence</u> <u>of</u> <u>jurisdiction</u>
<u>until</u> <u>a</u> <u>cause</u> <u>is</u> <u>finally</u> <u>resolved</u> <u>or</u>
<u>adjudicated</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>apply</u> <u>when</u> <u>the</u> <u>change</u>
<u>in</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> <u>is</u> <u>curative</u> <u>in</u> <u>character</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus in the instant case, there is nothing
wrong in holding that Courts of First Instance/Regional Trial Courts no longer
have jurisdiction over aforesaid monetary claims of labor [at p. 671;
Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is therefore no reason why P.D. 1691 should not be given
retroactive application to this pending case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>P.D. 1691 merely restored the jurisdiction earlier vested in Labor
Arbiters before the enactment of P.D. 1367.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was intended to correct a situation where two tribunals would have
jurisdiction over separate issues arising from the same labor conflict [Ebon v.
De Guzman, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Aguda</span> v. <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Vallejos</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <u>supra</u>; Sentinel
Insurance Company, Inc., v. Bautista, <u>supra</u>; Atlas Fertilizer v.
Navarro, <u>supra</u>.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, private respondents can still file an action before
the administrative machineries in the Department of Labor and Employment [Getz,
Corp. <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>;
Atlas Fertilizer Corp., v. Navarro, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
v. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">RTC </span>of Manila, <u>supra</u>.]
While it is true that the respondents-employees’ cause of action has already
prescribed, since Article 291 of the Labor Code provide for a three-year
prescriptive period for all money claims arising from employer-employee
relations, equity dictates that petitioners be allowed to file the proper
action before the appropriate labor tribunal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the time the petitioners filed their complaint with the then Court of
First Instance, the regular courts were the proper forum for all claims for
damages arising from employer-employee relations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, the retroactive
application of Pres. Decree 1691 should not unduly deprive petitioners of the
right to pursue their claim in the proper tribunal if they choose to do so.</p>
