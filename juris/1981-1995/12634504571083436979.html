				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The decision of the Court of Appeals in Libuton
vs. Soque, CA-G.R. No.</span> SP-11252-CAR, <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1981</st1:date>, an agrarian case, was served on <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1981</st1:date> upon the counsel for
the landowner, Rodolfo B. Soque.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eighteen days thereafter or on February 9, Soque filed a motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That motion was not
acted upon because, as stated by the Court of Appeals in its resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1981</st1:date>, section 18 of
Presidential Decree No. 946 does not allow a motion for rehearing or
reconsideration of the decision of the Court of Appeals in agrarian cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1981</st1:date>,
the Clerk of Court of the Court of Appeals entered judgment in the said case on
the assumption that the decision became final and executory on <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="2"><u>February 7, 1981</u></st1:date><u>,</u>
sixteen days after the service thereof on Soque, the defeated party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record was remanded on <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1981</st1:date> to the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> in <st1:place><st1:placename>Bacolod</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The entry of judgment is erroneous because the judgment did not
become final on February 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became
final on February 22 or after thirty days from notice to Soque's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 18 gives Soque a "non-extendible
period of thirty (30) days" from notice of the decision within which to
file an appeal to this Court by means of a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In ordinary cases or non-agrarian cases, the reglementary period
for appealing to this Court from the decision of the Court of Appeals is <u>fifteen</u>
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, if there is no appeal within
that period, the judgment becomes final on the sixteenth day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In agrarian cases, the Court of Appeals
should enter judgment on the thirty-first day or thereafter, that is, after the
expiration of the thirty-day period within which to appeal to this Court and no
appeal is interposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, Soque mailed to this Court on <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1981</st1:date> an urgent motion for
extension of time within which to file a petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He inaccurately alleged that his counsel
received on March 10 a copy of the Appellate Court's resolution of February 12,
"denying" his motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">His motion was not denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was simply "noted" because that motion was out of
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not authorized by section
18.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court in its resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1981</st1:date> erroneously granted Soque an extension of
thirty days from March 15 within which to file his petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was mailed on <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the petition should be dismissed because it was
filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should have been
filed within the non-extendible period of thirty days from January 22, when
Soque was served with a copy of the decision, or on or before February 21.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thirty-day extension was granted to Soque through
oversight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution granting it is
hereby set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not entitled to
that extension.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held in Caparas vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 56772-84, <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1981</st1:date> (thirteen cases), the
provision of section 18 that the thirty-day period is non-extendible <span class="GramE">is</span> peremptory or mandatory in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obvious intent of the lawmaker is to
avoid delays in the disposition of agraÂ­rian cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Dura</u> <u>lex</u>, <u>sed</u> <u>lex.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">That intention is evident in another provision of section 18,
directing that the complete records of the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> should be forwarded to the Court of Appeals
"within a non-extendible period of fifteen (15) days from receipt of a
notice of appeal".</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition in this case is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Barredo, Concepcion, Jr., Fernandez, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> De Castro, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.</span></span><br>
