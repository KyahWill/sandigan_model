by complainants <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Siscar</span> and
Angelina de Lara <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span> is the basis for this
administrative charge against respondent Guillermo <span style="">R. </span><span class="SpellE">Viña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is accused of betrayal of trust,
malpractice, and conduct unbecoming of a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the language thereof:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Since the time that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> became our counsel way back in 1968 up to the present,
he has not provided us copies of pleadings filed in the lower court and in the
appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had to acquire the
said pleadings directly from the trial court and the appellate court, and on
September 1, 1974 said counsel asked for and received from us the amount of
P600.00 * * * although our agreement is he would bear all expenses of our
litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could sense a betrayal of
trust on the part of our counsel when on the night of March 31, 1976, <span style="">we </span>went to his house at 139 F. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> St., San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in
order to ask from him the status of the case in the Court of Appeals and to provide
us with copies of the pleadings but to our surprise, he started saying bad
words against us and treated us like dogs in his residence and told us to get
out of his house as if he were not our counsel and therefore a trustee of the
litigation that we have against the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By his actuations in the past of not providing us pleadings in the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> cases, not explaining to us the status of the
cases which culminated in his saying bad words to us on the night of <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1976</st1:date>, we can no longer
trust Atty. <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are of the belief that his acts as a lawyer cannot keep up with the
standard required by the law in the exercise of his profession and that he has
violated the rules of legal ethics by the acts as aforementioned that he did
against his own client amounting to a betrayal of trust, rendering his integrity
as <span style="">a </span>person and a lawyer and that
he should be investigated as a member of the profession of law and the proper
penalty <span style="">meted </span>out to him should
he be found guilty of the charges (betrayal of trust, malpractice, conduct unbecoming
of a lawyer) that we place against him."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The answer of respondent characterized the complaint as without
basis and with being "filed maliciously," the allegations
"devoid of truth, unmeritorious and full of distorted facts and presumptions
with the aim and purpose of <i>[</i>misleading<i>]</i> this Honorable Court and
Tribunal."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He admitted being the retained counsel of complainants in an intestate estate
proceeding of Jacinta <span class="SpellE">Siscar</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de <span class="SpellE">Valmores</span>, both in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asserted that even before the time
required for doing so, he filed his brief for his client "after a legal,
learned and mature judicial thinking and meditation" and after researching
in the library of this Court <span style="">"and </span>likewise
only after reading all the legal and judicious legal and constitutional
authorities herein and abroad, * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
While admitting that the information about the status of the case was sought
from him especially by complainant <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Siscar</span>, he denied any allegation of rudeness on his
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version of the incident was
quite different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that on one
occasion, complainant <span class="SpellE">Siscar</span>, accompanied by her
daughter, Angelina de Lara <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span>, paid a visit to
him to find out about the status of the case in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He informed them it would act in due time but
that not all pleadings had as yet been submitted to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then c<span style="">ame
</span>this statement: "Angelina de Lara <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span>
started uttering in a hostile manner, insulting words and statements against
me, even in the presence of my in-laws and maids - which utterances were delivered
in an angry and sarcastic moods and manners (<u>sic</u>) towards my
professional and legal integrity as their retained counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, as a human being - I was hurt and feel
(<u>sic</u>) offended by said derogatory and slanderous remarks - so your
honor, I told them to go home, as the night was late already and I was feeling
tired and I wanted to rest and have a nice, good and quiet sleep."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He ascribed the filing of the complaint of <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Siscar</span> to the fact that when she wanted him to defend
another son of her, then under indictment of the crime of theft before the Municipal
Court of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, he refused to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was then quite “busy in <i>[</i>his<i><span style="font-size: 13pt;">]</span></i> legal affairs
in <i>[</i>his<i>]</i> law office and advised them to retain another
counsel."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As to the amount of six hundred pesos (P600.00), he admitted receipt thereof
but he pointed out that it was intended "to cover the expenses of the
preparation and printing of their Briefs which <i>[</i>he had<i>]</i> already
filed in the Court of Appeals, on <st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="6">June
 18, 1976</st1:date>."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Complainants agreed "that they should shoulder the Transcript of
Stenographic notes and the Briefs to be filed in Court – but as regard to <i>[</i>his<i>]</i>
legal appearance in the lower court <i>[</i>he<i>]</i> was not charging them
and in fact in this reg<span style="">a</span>rd and
connection – when one of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors-appellees</span> by
the name of Claudia <span class="SpellE">Siscar</span> gave <i>[</i>him<i>]</i> –
one time the amount of Ten (P10.00) Pesos – for <i>[</i>his<i>]</i> coffee and
taxi fare – <i>[</i>he<i>]</i> politely refused <span style="">to </span>accept said money."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, as to the furnishing copies of
pleadings, he stated in his answer that he had "done it already" and
in fact <i>[</i>he<i>]</i> gave a copy of <i>[</i>his<i>]</i> Brief for <span class="SpellE">oppositors-appellees</span> to the husband of Socorro <span class="SpellE">Siscar</span> Rivera by the name of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
Rivera, with an instruction to said couple to pass it around to the other <span class="SpellE">oppositors-appellees</span> including the herein <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Siscar</span> and
families."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, on <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="8">August
 28, 1976</st1:date>, issued the following resolution: "Considering the
answer of respondent himself to the letter-complaint, filed in compliance with
the resolution of <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1976</st1:date>,
the Court Resolved to <i>[</i>refer<i>]</i> this case to the Solicitor General
for investigation, report and recommendation."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
After an investigation duly conducted, a Report signed by Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
was submitted to this Court wherein it was recommended that "the complaint
to disbar respondent Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Viña</span> be dismissed for
lack of merit."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Based on the hearing conducted by the Office of the Solicitor General, the
Report contained the following recital:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The testimonies of complainants <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Siscar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> and Angelina de Lara <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span>
were all centered on the alleged incident that transpired on March 31, 1976, at
about 9:00 <span class="SpellE">o"clock</span> in the evening, in the house
of respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all declared
that when they inquired about the status of their intestate case then pending
with the Court of Appeals, respondent got mad and drove them out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * In effect, they seek to establish that
respondent would not want them to know anything about their case and was
treating them badly for some unknown reason.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During cross-examination, however, complainant <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Siscar</span> admitted that respondent required her to see
him at least once a month to be informed of the progress of the case * * *; and
that it was respondent who relayed to her the good news that they won the case
in the trial court although it was appealed by the adverse parties to the Court
of Appeals * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After complainants had
testified, they filed a 'Manifestation to Withdraw Complaint', dated <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * It was signed by complainants
themselves and their counsel from the Citizens Legal Assistance Office,
Ministry of Justice * * *.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therein,
complainants state, among others, that they filed the present complaint because
they resented respondent's irritating and annoying conduct on March 31, 1976
when they inquired about the status of their appealed case, particularly the
extent of, or how far respondent had gone in the preparation of their <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' brief * * *; that they later came to know the
justification of respondent's conduct, after the customary confrontation and
conciliation meeting called upon and presided by a religious minister of the <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> <span class="SpellE">ni</span> <span class="SpellE">Kristo</span>
where they all belong * * *; <span style="">and </span>that
they learned that there was a mere misunderstanding or miscommunication, as
respondent was irri­tated by the remark '<span class="SpellE">Baka</span> kung <span class="SpellE">ano</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">nangyayari</span> <span class="SpellE">diyan</span>?', hurled
by complainant Angelina <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span>, which respondent
took as an affront to his honesty and integrity, although what <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span> allegedly said was ‘<span class="SpellE">Baka</span> <span style="">kung <span class="SpellE">ano</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">mangyari</span> <span class="SpellE">diyan</span>?',
which was uttered after respondent explained the reasons on the delay in the
preparation and filing of their <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * In his defense, respondent
presented as witness complainant <span class="SpellE">Cristeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Siscar</span> who declared under oath the veracity and
truthfulness of the alle­gations contained in the aforementioned 'Manifestation
</span>to Withdraw Complaint' * * *.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent then presented himself as a witness and testified, among
others, that he had won for the complainants their intestate case in the Court
of Appeals per decision promulgated November 9, 1979 under CA-G.R. No. 5554142-R
* * *, that on the night of March 31, 1976, he explained to complainants that
he could not yet file their <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' brief because
the record of the case forwarded to the Court of Appeals was not yet complete
and that he showed complainants several motions he filed in the appellate court
in connection therewith and advised them not to worry, but to his surprise,
complainant <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span> angrily uttered in the presence
of other persons '<span class="SpellE">Baka</span> <span class="SpellE">ano</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">nangyayari</span>
<span class="SpellE">diyan</span>?', '<span class="SpellE">baka</span> may <span class="SpellE">kawalanghiyaan</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>', which hurt
and annoyed him and so, he told them to go home * * *.”<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The Report then concluded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the
light of the foregoing, it is respectfully submitted that complainants failed
to substantiate their complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact that respon­dent successfully handled complainants' case in the lower
court and the Court of Appeals * * * negates the charge of 'betrayal of trust
and malpractice.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to Um charge of
conduct unbecoming of a lawyer, no sufficient evidence had been adduced in
support there­of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
complainants themselves admitted that respondent was justified in being annoyed
by the uncalled for remark of complainant <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of the complaint is, therefore, warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would appear that respondent was more
sinned against than sinning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
incident, which was the basis for the disciplinary action filed arose from a
misunderstanding between him and the daughter of his client, complainant <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
reaction to her words which could be interpreted as a reflection on his honesty
based solely on the delay in the decision of a case is quite understandable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been said and correctly so that a
lawyer's good name in the last analysis is his most important possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any slur, whether expressed or implied, or as
a result of the ambiguity of the words used, can cause resent­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it was not only the words employed
but the accusatory tone of complainant <span class="SpellE">Belleza</span> <span style="">that </span>wounded his sensibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was all that happened in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Viña</span>' s
conduct, therefore, cannot be said to be blameworthy.</p>
