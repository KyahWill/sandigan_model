Petition for <em>certiorari </em>with writ of preliminary injunction 
seeking review of the resolution of the National Labor Relations 
Commission which affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter awarding to 
private respondent the sum of P84,587.58 representing unpaid legal fees.
  The pertinent portion of the decision was as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Coming now to the money claim raised by complainant, we noted 
that the position paper, as well as the documentary evidence submitted 
by respondent never did touch on this issue.  Respondent's silence on 
this point has led us to the inevitable conclusion that complainant is 
indeed entitled to these monetary claims.  More so, in the light of the 
fact that the contract of employment entered into by the parties 
provides among others that "Should your duties permit, you may handle 
recovery cases for the company for which you will be entitled to fifteen
 (15%) per cent legal fees for amount actually recovered." (par. 4). </p>
    <p> "As computed, complainant's legal fees for the recovery cases he handled for the company are as follows: </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>
Petitioner, Sentinel Insurance Company, was in accord with the portion 
of the decision dismissing the complaint of respondent, Porfirio 
Bautista; however, it disagreed with the portion which awarded 
P84,587.58 to Bautista because contending that the Labor Arbiter was 
without jurisdiction to make such award, the same being within the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the civil courts.
</p><p>
The factual background of the case is as follows:
</p><p>
Porfirio M. Bautista was hired as Legal Officer by Sentinel and his letter of appointment provided, among others, the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "4. Should your duties permit, you may handle recovery cases for 
the company for which you will be entitled fifteen (15%) per cent legal 
fees for amount actually recovered."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the course of his employment, Bautista handled a number of cases for 
which he was paid fifteen (15%) per cent on amounts recovered except for
 the four cases in question which, according to Bautista, he deferred 
the billing and collection of his percentage on said cases because of 
his awareness of the tight financial condition of the company.
</p><p>
Bautista also handled thirteen other cases which, according to 
petitioner, were defaulted and/or dismissed for reasons attributable to 
him.  Believing that the defaults/dismissals of the thirteen cases were 
the results of the wanton connivance of Bautista with the adverse 
parties and/or gross negligence sufficient to warrant his dismissal for 
loss of trust and confidence, petitioner served private respondent 
notice of termination of his services on April 2, 1979 to take effect 
March 31, 1979.  On March 29, 1979, petitioner applied for clearance to 
terminate employment with the Ministry of Labor and Employment but which
 was opposed by Bautista on May 31, 1979.  In his opposition, Bautista 
questioned the legality of his dismissal and at the same time asserted 
his claim for unpaid legal fees in the sum of P87,800.00 pursuant to the
 terms and conditions of his employment, particularly the provision on 
legal fees.
</p><p>
No settlement having been arrived at in the conciliatory hearing, the 
case was referred to the National Capital Region of the Ministry of 
Labor and Employment.  In the position paper submitted, petitioner 
presented its reasons for the application for clearance but remained 
silent on the matter of the money claim.
</p><p>
On September 28, 1979, the Labor Arbiter rendered the questioned 
decision.  Dissatisfied with the portion awarding the money claim, 
petitioner appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission and 
argued that the Labor Arbiter erred in assuming that Bautista was 
entitled to the legal fees irrespective of the means by which he 
effected recoveries for the company.
</p><p>
Considering that there was no dispute that the appointment of Bautista 
provided for the 15% legal fees on top of his basic salary and finding 
that there appeared to be no qualification for entitlement of the 
disputed fees and there being no denial that Bautista handled the four 
cases subjects of the controversy and succeeded in recovering for the 
company, the National Labor Relations Commission on August 29, 1980 
affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter and dismissed the appeal.
</p><p>
Sentinel Insurance sought reconsideration of the dismissal which was 
however denied on December 10, 1980.  Hence this petition for <em>certiorari</em>.
  On January 12, 1981, We issued a temporary restraining order enjoining
 the National Labor Relations Commission from enforcing and/or carrying 
out any writ of execution issued or might be issued pursuant to its 
resolution and to continue until otherwise ordered.
</p><p>
It is alleged that at the time Bautista instituted his money claim by 
way of opposition, the employer-employee relationship has ceased.  The 
allegation is without basis.  Bautista filed a timely opposition to the 
application for authority to terminate his employment.  The 
employer-employee tie certainly existed at that point of time.  Although
 Bautista did not seek reinstatement, he demanded compliance with one of
 the express terms of the employment, thus the dispute is one arising 
from employer-employee relationship.
</p><p>
The main argument of petitioner is that the money claim is civil in 
character cognizable only by regular courts and therefore beyond the 
jurisdiction and competence of the Labor Arbiter.  Petitioner invoked 
the ruling in Jose D. Calderon, Sr. <em>vs. </em>Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  promulgated on October 28, 1980 where this Court held that an alleged 
oppressive act of non-payment of salaries, allowances and other 
reimbursable expenses is intrinsically a civil dispute within the 
jurisdiction of regular courts to resolve and beyond that of Labor 
Arbiters.  The Calderon case was based on PD No. 1367 enacted May 1, 
1978 and which removed from the exclusive jurisdiction of Labor Arbiters
 money claims arising from employer-employee relations, the jurisdiction
 of said Labor Arbiters over said cases being expressly limited to those
 which are duly endorsed by the Regional Directors in accordance with 
the provisions of the Labor Code and which in no case shall include 
claims for moral or other forms of damages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Calderon case, however, is no longer controlling because the law 
upon which said decision was based, Article 217 of the Labor Code as 
amended by PD No. 1367, has been superceded by PD No. 1691 which took 
effect May 1, 1980 and which restored to the Labor Arbiters original and
 exclusive jurisdiction over claims, monetary or otherwise, provided by 
law or by appropriate agreement, arising from employer-employee 
relations, except those expressly excluded therefrom.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
Although the cause of action arose when PD No. 1367 was then the 
prevailing law and upon which the Calderon case was premised, said 
Decree was no longer applicable when the case was resolved by the 
National Labor Relations Commission on August 29, 1980.  The law then in
 force was PD No. 1691.
</p><p>
Article 217 as amended by PD No. 1367 and PD No. 1691 was again amended 
by Batas Pambansa Bilang 130 which took effect August 21, 1981.  On June
 1, 1982, said Article 217 was amended anew by Batas Pambansa Bilang 227
 vesting on Labor Arbiters jurisdiction over cases that workers may file
 involving wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of 
employment and all money claims of workers, except claims for employees'
 com­pensation, social security, medicare and maternity benefits.
</p><p>
Undoubtedly, the claim of 15% legal fees arose out of employer-employee 
relationship and clearly falls within the coverage of Article 217 as 
amended by PD No. 1691 and Batas Pambansa Bilang 227.
</p><p>
In Garcia <em>vs. </em>Martinez,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  promulgated May 28, 1979, PD No. 1367 was held to be an amendatory 
decree in the nature of a curative statute with retrospective 
application to a pending proceeding which cured the lack of jurisdiction
 of the Court of First Instance of Davao City over a complaint for 
damages al­legedly arising from the dismissal of a radio station manager
 which was filed on August 2, 1976.  PD No. 1691 and BP No. 227 are 
likewise curative statutes which cured the lack of jurisdiction of the 
Labor Arbiter at the start of the proceeding and should be given 
retrospective application to this pending proceedings, as the precise 
purpose of the amendments was to settle once and for all the conflict of
 jurisdiction between regular courts and labor agencies.
</p><p>
Moreover, petitioner is estopped from questioning the jurisdiction of 
the Labor Arbiter to award the money claim considering that in the 
position paper it submitted to the Labor Arbiter, it never objected but 
in fact remained silent as to the claim which was asserted not only in 
the opposition for termination of employment but also raised as an issue
 at the conciliation hearing.
</p><p>
Also, as correctly argued by respondent Bautista, it was petitioner who 
commenced the action for dismissal, and he merely asserted a claim 
expressly provided by the terms of his employment so much so that 
petitioner cannot pretend that the Labor Arbiter possessed jurisdiction 
over issues of illegal dismissal, as in fact, it did not question the 
portion of the decision which sustained the dismissal because it was in 
its favor, but alleged that the Labor Arbiter did not have the authority
 to adjudicate the claim for legal fees although part of the express 
terms of the contract of employment because it is to its disadvantage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
Furthermore, to state that this case involves both a labor controversy 
and a civil dispute would be to sanction split jurisdiction which is 
obnoxious to the orderly administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  In a number of cases this Court expounded on this holding that 
evidently, the lawmaking authority had second thoughts about depriving 
Labor Arbiters and the National Labor Relations Commission of the 
jurisdiction to award damages in labor cases because that setup means 
duplicity of suits, splitting the cause of action and possible 
conflicting findings and conclusions by two tribunals of one and the 
same claim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p><p>
In view of the foregoing, We hold that the National Labor Relations 
Commission did not commit grave abuse of discretion in sustaining the 
money claim granted by the Labor Arbiter which arose out of an 
employer-employee relationship and which, as we hereby hold, was within 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby dismissed.  The temporary 
restraining order heretofore issued is hereby lifted.  No costs.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero</em>, and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
