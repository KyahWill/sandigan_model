and <i>mandamus</i> assail the Resolutions dated March 7, 1989 and April 10,
1989 of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC-NCR Case No.
00-08-02892­-87, which set aside the decision of the Labor Arbiter and ordered
the latter to receive further evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1983</st1:date>,
petitioner Rico G. <span class="SpellE">Gata</span> was employed by Bristol
Laboratories (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.), Inc. (hereinafter referred to
as "the company") as Territory Manager for the <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan-</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Baguio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> area.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In January
1987, he was transferred to the <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
receiving a monthly salary of P4<span class="GramE">,750.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As territory manager, his job <span style="">was </span>to promote the company's specific
product brands by conducting an aggressive promotional campaign.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 16, 1987, the company's Northern Luzon district manager,
F.A. <span class="SpellE">Mariazeta</span>, Jr., reported to the company, through
its Region Sales Manager, P.C. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Gata</span> had withdrawn stocks, without authority, from two
company customers:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Customer <span style="">No. </span>10590 - <span class="SpellE">Farmacia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> in <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> in the amount of P25,603.60 per Invoice No.
619085 dated August 25, 1986 (Exhibits B, C, D and E), for which <span class="SpellE">Gata</span> issued two (2) personal checks which<span style="">&nbsp; </span>later bounced; and (2) Customer No. 10661 -
the Dr. Gregorio de Guzman Medical Clinic in San Fabian, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
in the amount of P16,527.50 as per Invoice No. 61959 dated September 18, 1986
(Exhibit 1), for which <span class="SpellE">Gata</span> issued three (3) personal
checks, two of which bounced upon maturity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gata</span> was able to replace one of the
checks he issued to <span class="SpellE">Farmacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span>
by paying two installments of P5<span class="GramE">,000</span> each.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gata's</span> immediate supervisor, District
Manager J.L. <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>, conducted a separate
investigation on the matter and thereafter submitted a report dated March 20, 1987,
confirming the findings of District Manager <span class="SpellE">Mariazeta</span>,
Jr. Acting on the reports, the company's Personnel Manager, J.F. Fuentes, Jr.,
issued a memorandum on March 30, 1987 directing <span class="SpellE">Gata</span>
to explain in writing within ten days (or until April 12, 1987) why his
employment should not be terminated for cause in view of the unauthorized
withdrawals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was also placed under
preventive suspension for an indefinite period.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gata</span> made a vague general denial of the
charges against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">A formal investigation was conducted by the personnel department
on April 29, 1987, during which <span class="SpellE">Gata</span>, represented by
counsel Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nitura</span> and the union president,
Santiago <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>, was confronted with twelve (12)
documents (Annexes 5 to 16 of the written reports) evidencing the unauthorized
stock withdrawals <span style="">in </span>violation
of the company's Rules on Conduct With Physicians and its Trade/Outlet Policy
of Stock Withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the face of <span class="SpellE">Gata's</span> reiterated denials, the company issued a memorandum
dismissing him for serious misconduct and <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
breach of trust.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1987</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Gata</span> filed in the Ministry of Labor and Employment a
complaint for illegal dismissal, illegal suspension, withholding of benefits
and violation of the CBA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After five (5)
hearings, the Labor Arbiter issued a decision dated July 28, 1988, dismissing
the complaint for lack of merit but nonetheless ordering the payment to <span class="SpellE">Gata</span> of separation pay equivalent to one month for every
year of service, computed at P19,000 (pp. 26-38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gata</span> and the union appealed to the NLRC
in NCR Case No. 00-08-02892-87.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
company opposed the appeal, attaching thereto various supporting documentary
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1989</st1:date>,
the NLRC issued a resolution vacating and/or setting aside the labor arbiter's
decision and remanding to the labor arbiter the entire records of the case for
reception of evidence and further proceedings, "for proper evaluation of
the evidence adduced in line with the requirements of due process." <span class="GramE">(pp. 21-23, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span> The
complainants' motion for reconsideration of the resolution was denied by the
NLRC on <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1989</st1:date> (p.
24, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners allege that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span class="GramE">in</span>
considering respondent's unverified opposition to the appeal with the evidence
introduced for the first time on appeal; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span class="GramE">in</span>
remanding the case to the labor arbiter and in not resolving the case on the
merits.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that although the respondent-employer failed to
submit <span style="">a </span>position paper, it was
not declared in default, as <span class="GramE">no</span> motion to declare it in
default was filed by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Procedural technicalities do not strictly apply to proceedings before
labor arbiters for they may avail themselves of all reasonable means to
speedily ascertain the facts of <span style="">a </span>controversy (Art. 221, Labor Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">No grave abuse of discretion may be attributed to the NLRC for
having considered additional documentary evidence submitted by the
respondent-employer on appeal, to prove breach of trust and loss of confidence
as bases for the dismissal of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even if that additional evidence were to be disregarded, its effect
being merely cumulative inasmuch <span style="">as </span>the evidence in the records was
sufficient to support the Labor Arbiter's finding of legal and justifiable
grounds for terminating the employment of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Gata</span>,
it was error for the NLRC to remand the case to the Labor Arbiter for further
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could, and should, have
resolved the appeal on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Columbia Development Corporation vs. MOLE, 146 SCRA 421, where certain balance
sheets and income statements were submitted by the company only on appeal, we
held that they should have been considered by the Minister of Labor "in
keeping with the directive of Art. <span class="GramE">221 of the Labor
Code."</span> The Court reiterated an earlier ruling to <span style="">the same </span>effect in <span class="SpellE">Haverton</span>
Shipping Ltd. vs. NLRC, 135 SCRA 685.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the evidence in the records, the Labor Arbiter
made the following findings of fact:</p>

<blockquote>"Going now to the charge of illegal dismissal, this Office
finds that Complainant was dismissed for justifiable causes and was given the
opportunity to explain and defend his side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent BLPI charged Complainant with unauthorized stock withdrawals
on the basis of reports from its two (2) district managers who separately
conducted an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reports
contained detailed accounts of the transactions made by the Complainant with
two (2) outlets/customers of Respondent BLPI, which reports clearly convinced
Respondent BLPI that Complainant personally withdrew stocks from said outlets
in violation of company <span style="">policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It appears that under company policy,
products can only be withdrawn from outlets upon prior approval of the National
Sales Manager and to be implemented by the District Manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent BLPI, therefore, had a basis for
believing that Complainant is responsible for the misconduct which rendered him
absolutely unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In several instances, the Court had
sanctioned the dismissal of an employee when ‘the employer has reasonable
grounds to believe, if not to entertain, the moral conviction that the employee
concerned is responsible for the misconduct and that the nature of his
participation therein rendered him absolutely unworthy of the trust and
confidence demanded by his position.’ <span class="GramE">(REYES V. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">ZAMORA</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> 30 SCRA

<blockquote>"Complainant holds a position of responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a territory manager, Complainant has the
responsibility of assisting in the effective distribution of Respondent <span style="">firm's </span>products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's position therefore entails the
trust and confidence of his employer and breach of such trust is a justifiable cause
for dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In
LAMSAN TRADING V. HON. VICENTE LEOGARDO, JR. ET.</span> AL., G.R. No. 73245, <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1986</st1:date>, it was held that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'xxx If the private respondents are cashiers, managers,
supervisors, salesmen, <u>or</u> <u>other</u> <u>per­sonnel</u> <u>occupying</u>
<u>positions</u> <u>of</u> <u>responsibility</u>, the requirement that an
employee should enjoy the trust and confidence of his employer may justify
their termination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Under­lining
supplied).'</p>

<blockquote>Being the person with whom the
buyers/outlets of Respondent BLPI had to deal with, Complainant's <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> in the field has a great bearing on Respondent's
goodwill and the marketability of its products.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, Complainant has the primary duty to carry out the policies laid
out by his employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not difficult
to see that non-compliance with company policies would not only erode
discipline among company personnel but would also adversely affect the
distribution of products of the company.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is also seen from the records that Complainant was
afforded due process in accordance with B.P. 130.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was issued a memorandum requiring
him to explain his side relative to the reported stock withdrawals made by him
and was further subjected to an investigation by the company Personnel
Officer." <span class="GramE">(pp. 34-36, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the Labor Arbiter that the petitioner was
dismissed for a lawful cause with due process are supported by substantial
evidence, <span class="GramE">hence,</span> they are binding on this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter's order awarding separation
pay to the petitioner is erroneous because one who is dismissed for cause is
not entitled to that benefit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
as the private respondent BLPI did not appeal that decision, it is not entitled
to affirmative relief (American International Underwriters (Phil.), Inc. vs.
CIR, 55 SCRA 227; Philippine Air Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Padilla, G.R.
