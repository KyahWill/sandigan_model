due process was denied the petitioners when the respondent labor arbiter
rendered a decision based on position papers filed by the parties without
conducting a trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is erroneously captioned "Petition for Review
on <i>Certiorari</i>." This error notwithstanding, and in the interest of
justice, the Court resolved to treat the instant petition as a special civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">action </span>for <i>certiorari</i> on

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The undisputed facts are </span>as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 14, 1985, private respondent Baltazar C. Gorombalem filed
a complaint with the Regional Arbitration Branch of the National Labor
Relations Commission (NLRC) against petitioner Robusta Agro Marine Products,
Inc., (Robusta <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>short), for
unfair labor practice, illegal suspension, non-payment of overtime pay and
premium pay for holiday and rest day, violation of various decrees on minimum
wage and allowa<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">n</span>ces, unpaid
wages or commission, night shift differential pay, and separation pay.  The case was docketed as NLRC Case No. RB
IV-6-1639-85.</p>

<p class="BODY">Initial hearing was scheduled for June 27, 1985.  Notice was sent by registered mail to
Robusta.  As there was no appearance for
both Robusta and Gorombalem, the hearing was reset.  Robusta attended the July <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">1,
</span>1985 hearing which was again reset for July 9 inasmuch as Gorombalem
failed to appear.  On July 9 Robusta
failed to appear so the hearing was reset for July 19.  Both parties were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">represented </span>during the July 19 hearing.  Nevertheless, the hearing was reset again to
July 21 for possible amicable settlement.  On July 26, 1985, both parties were again represented.  However, upon their agreement, the hearing
was reset to August 8, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the August hearing, the parties failed to amicably settle the
case.  Gorombalem filed his <u>sinumpaang</u>
<u>salaysay</u> (sworn statement), with a copy furnished to Robusta.  Robusta was directed by the labor arbiter to
file its answer within 10 days.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 20, 1985, Robusta filed a Manifestation and Urgent
Motion for Extension of Time To File Counter Affidavit <u>Ex</u>-<u>Parte</u>,
requesting that it be given fifteen (15) days from said date within which to
file its counter affidavit.  The labor
arbiter granted the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 4, 1985, Robusta filed a Second Motion For Extension
of Further Time To File Position Paper/Counter Affidavit, requesting another
extension of fifteen days from September 4, 1985.  The labor arbiter granted the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 18, 1985, Robusta filed a third Motion For Extension
of Further Time To File Counter Affidavit, <u>ex</u>-<u>parte</u> requesting a
period of fifteen (15) days from September 19, 1985 within which to file
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 4, 1985, Robusta filed an Addendum to Motion For
Extension of Further Time to file Counter Affidavit, <u>ex</u>-<u>parte</u>
asking for another fifteen (15) days from October 4, 1985.  This time, the labor arbiter in a notice sent
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on O</span>ctober 4, 1985, denied the
motion for a fourth extension of time, but gave Robusta three days (3) from
receipt of notice within which to file its position paper and evidence, with a
warning that after the expiration of the three-day period, the case would be
decided on the basis of the documents submitted and that no further motion for
reconsideration shall be entertained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Robusta received the notice on October 7, 1985, and it forthwith
submitted its position paper on October 10, 1985 refuting the <u>Sinumpaang</u>
<u>Salay</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">say</span></u> of
Gorombalem and stating therein that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">submission
is </span>subject to Robusta's right to finally submit a more extensive
supplemental position paper and counter-affidavit of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sinumpaang</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>Salaysay</u> </span>submitted by
Gorombalem <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">alleges </span>that from
June 15, 1981 to August 30, 1981, he worked as a fishpond guard with Robusta in
the latter's fishpond in Barangay Subay, Cardona, Rizal with a salary of
P300.00 a month <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">plus </span>a ration of
two <u>g</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">antas</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>of rice every week.  As fishpond guard, he worked from 6:00 p.m.
to 6:00 a.m., Monday to Sunday.  He had
no rest day.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">He </span>was not paid overtime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pay,
</span>holiday pay, night shift differential pay and cost of living
allowance.  From September 1981 to
December 31, 1982, he did not report for work.  On January 1, 1983, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he </span>returned
to work and Robusta assigned him again as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fishpond
</span>guard with a monthly salary of P400.00 and a ration of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">two <u>g</u></span><u>antas</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of rice </span>every week.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">His </span>tour
of duty was from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Again, he had no rest day, and Robusta did not pay him overtime pay,
holiday pay, night shift differential pay, 13th month pay, and cost <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>living allowance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">On </span>January 1, 1985,
Gorombalem was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">given </span>an
additional salary of P50.00 a month, but his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ration </span>of two <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">gantas</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>of rice per week was reduced to one <u>ganta</u>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>rice per week.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">June </span>6, 1985,
private respondent inquired from Honest Subida, Robusta's general manager,
about the reduction of his ration.  Subida got angry and told him that he did not like to see <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his </span>(Gorombalem's) face anymore.  Subida also prohibited him from reporting
for work.  Thus, Gorombalem no longer
reported for work.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its position paper Robusta, denied that Gorombalem was
illegally dismissed.  It claimed that
Gorombalem stopped working voluntarily because he was afraid of retaliation
from a victim who charged him with frustrated homicide before the Court of
First Instance of Rizal in a case docketed as Criminal Case No. 4457 and filed
on September 1, 1981, and for which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>warrant
of arrest was issued against him on September 3, 1981.  Robusta maintained that Gorombalem stopped
working from September 1, 1981 and that he returned to work only on January 1,
1983.  Robusta also invoked prescription
against the claim for benefits from June 15, 1981 to August 30, 1981 and
January 1, 1983 to January 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">The labor arbiter rendered a decision on October 24, 1985,
ordering Robusta to reinstate Gorombalem and to pay him backwages, overtime
pay, night shift differential pay, premium pay for holidays <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>premium pay for rest days in the
total amount of P37,393.72.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Robusta appealed the decision to the NLRC <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">on the grounds that </span>the labor arbiter committed a grave abuse of
discretion in rendering the decision as well as serious errors in the findings
of fact which, if not corrected, would cause grave or irreparable injury to
Robusta.  Robusta claimed it was denied
a trial on the merits which is indispensable for purposes of administrative due
process.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision promulgated on July 1, 1987, the Second Division of
the NLRC<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
modified the decision of the labor arbiter by deleting the award of overtime
pay, night differential pay and premium pay for holidays and rest days because
of lack of evidence to support the claims.  The NLRC affirmed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">the </span>labor
arbiter's award for backwages arising from Robusta's violation of the various
Wage Orders issued by the government.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Gorombalem filed a motion for reconsideration of the NLRC
Decision, asking that the labor arbiter's decision be affirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Robusta also filed a motion for reconsideration of the NLRC decision on the
ground, among others, that the labor arbiter failed to afford Robusta
administrative due process by denying it a trial on the merits.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution promulgated on October 9, 1987, the NLRC denied
Robusta's motion for reconsideration for lack of merit and for having been
filed out of time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition anchored on the ground that
petitioner was denied administrative due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">What clearly appears in the record is contrary to petitioner's
claim that it was denied administrative due p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">r</span>ocess.  The simple
meaning of procedural due process is that a party to a case must be given
sufficient opportunity to be heard.  Its
very essence is to allow all parties opportunity to present evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In administrative cases, the requirement of due process is the
right to a hearing, including the right of the party interested or affected to
present his own case and submit evidence to support his allegation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The record of the case discloses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">that </span>the labor arbiter gave petitioner Robusta ample opportunity
to present its side and to give evidence.  It is petitioner's fault if it failed to do <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">so.  </span>It is a well-known
rule that in proceedings before the NLRC or a labor arbiter, technical rules of
procedure and evidence are not binding.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> Even
under the revised rules of the NLRC an expeditious procedure is provided for.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the aforementioned rules, after the initial conference for
a possible amicable settlement of the case, the parties are required to submit
their position papers accompanied by supporting documents and affidavits of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>witnesses.  Under Section 3 of the same Rule VII, the labor arbiter has the
discretion to determine the necessity for a formal hearing or
investigation.  This procedure was
observed by the labor arbiter in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Simplication of procedure, without regard to technicalities of
law or procedure and without sacrificing the fundamental requisites of due
process, is mandated to insure a speedy administration of social justice.  This Court construed Article 221 of the
Labor Code as to allow the NLRC or a labor arbiter to decide a case on the
basis of position papers and other documents submitted without resorting to
technical rules of evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>observed
in regular courts of justices.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, it is crystal clear from the record, that
petitioner was given several opportunities to present evidence in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">its </span>favor, but it failed to do
so.  At no time did petitioner ever ask
that there be a trial on the merits.  All that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it </span>submitted was
its position paper.  It was within the
competence of the labor arbiter to determine if there was a need for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a hearing.  In </span>this case, the labor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">arbiter
</span>did not deem necessary to conduct a hearing.  The petitioner was never denied administrative due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">court also </span>takes
note of the inconsistent stand of petitioner on the matter of Gorombalem's
separation from the service.  Petitioner's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">theory </span>in
its position paper was that the private respondent was not illegally dismissed
as he resigned voluntarily because he was afraid of retaliatory <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">action by the </span>victim of a criminal
incident for which he was charged.  On
the other hand, in its Motion for Reconsideration of the NLRC Decision, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petitioner </span>maintained that the
criminal charge against private respondent should have been considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">as </span>a justification for the dismissal of
private respondent.  This inconsistent
position is an eloquent indic<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">a</span>tion
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that the private </span>respondent was
dismissed from the service in an irregular manner and not in accordance with
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, if truly the private respondent committed an act which
was a lawful cause or justification for his dismissal, petitioner should have
given him the opportunity to explain or present his side.  There should not be an outright termination
of the services of private respondent without affording him due process.  Otherwise, it will be a violation of private
respondent's right to security of tenures.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit,
with costs against petitioner.</p>
