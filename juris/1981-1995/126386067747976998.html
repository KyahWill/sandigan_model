<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="1">4 January 1985</st1:date>,
respondent spouses Ricardo and Milagros <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>

against petitioner Thomas Yang and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Yaphockun</span>,
to recover possession <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>two (2)
Isuzu cargo trucks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their complaint,
the <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">spouses
</span>alleged that they had actual use and possession of the two (2) cargo
trucks, having acquired them during the period from 1982 to 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trucks were, however, registered in the
name of petitioner Thomas Yang who was the Treasurer in the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> spouses’
business of buying and selling corn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
<span class="SpellE">Morante</span> spouses further alleged that they were

 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, when

13.0pt">they were thereafter held.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Despite repeated demands, the complaint alleged, petitioner Yang refused
to release the trucks to respondent spouses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">To obtain immediate
possession of the Isuzu trucks, respondent spouses applied for a </span>writ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> and </span>put
up a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond of P560,000.00 executed by
respondent Milagros <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> <span class="SpellE">Calonzo</span> (counsel for
respondent spouses).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="1">7 January 1985</st1:date>,
the respondent judge issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an order </span>of
seizure directing the Provincial Sheriff of <st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

take immediate possession and custody of the vehicles involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff carried out the order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="1">10 January 1985</st1:date>,
defendant Manuel <span class="SpellE">Yaphockun</span> filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>motion seeking repossession of the
cargo trucks, and posted a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> counter-bond of
P560<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> executed by himself and one <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge promptly required the
respondent spouses to comment on the counter?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">bond proffered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent spouses reacted by amending their complaint on <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="1">13 January 1985</st1:date> by excluding Manuel <span class="SpellE">Yaphockun</span> as party-defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following day, i.e., <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="1">14 January 1985</st1:date>, the respondents submitted an
opposition to <span class="SpellE">Yaphockun's</span> counter-bond, contending
that since Manuel <span class="SpellE">Yaphockun</span> was merely a nominal
defendant, he had no standing to demand the return of the cargo trucks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By an order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="1">18 January 1985</st1:date>, the respondent judge disapproved
the counter-bond filed by Manuel <span class="SpellE">Yaphockun</span>, since the
latter had been dropped as party-defendant and accordingly no longer had any
personality to litigate in the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court also ordered the immediate
release and delivery of the cargo trucks to respondent spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, petitioner Yang moved, on <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="1">21 January 1985</st1:date>, for an extension of fifteen (15)
days within which to file an answer to the complaint for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Four days later, on <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="1">25 January 1985</st1:date>, petitioner put <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">up </span>a counter-bond in the amount of P560<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which counter-bond was, however, rejected by the
respondent judge for having been filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner Yang now
argues before us that, firstly, respondent judge had committed a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in approving the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond of respondent spouses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is contended by petitioner that that <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond was merely an undertaking of the bondsmen
Milagros <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Calonzo</span>
to pay the sum of P560<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, that no tangible
security, such </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"cash, property or surety", was
placed thereby at the disposal and custody of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is argued, secondly, that the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond was defective considering that it had been
filed by only one of the two (2) private respondents and that the bondsmen
thereon had failed by its terms to undertake to return the cargo trucks to
petitioner should he (the petitioner) be adjudged lawful owner thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We are not persuaded by
petitioner's arguments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A bond that is required
to be given by law is commonly understood to refer to an obligation or
undertaking in writing that is sufficiently secured.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> It is not indispensably necessary, however,
that the obligation of the bond </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">secured
or supported by cash or personal property or real property or the obligation of
a surety other than the person giving the bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most generally understood, a "bond" is an obligation reduced
to writing binding the obligor to pay a sum of money to the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span>
under specified conditions.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> At common law, a bond was merely a written

A <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bond is often, as a commercial </span>matter,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">secured by a mortgage on real property;
the mortgagee may be the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span>, although the
mortgagee may also be a third party surety whose personal credit is added to
that of the principal obligor under the bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The sufficiency of a bond
is a matter that is addressed to the sound discretion of the court which must </span>approve
the bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond given by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">respondent <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> spouses was </span>properly
secured by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sureties themselves who
declared their solvency and capacity to answer for the undertaking assumed,
through an </span>Affidavit of Justification which read <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"We, MILAGROS MORANTE and BAYANI L. CALONZO, both of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">legal age, Filipinos, married </span>and
residents of <span class="SpellE">Maltana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tampakan</span>,
South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
General Santos City, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">respectively,

in accordance with law do hereby depose and say:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That each of them is a

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That each of them is
worth the amount specified in the undertaking assumed by them in the above bond
over and above all debts, obligations and property exempt from execution.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we have hereunto set our hands, this 4th day of
January, 1985, at <st1:place><st1:city>General Santos City</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The
above sworn declaration of solvency which was </span>submitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to the judge together with the bond, in
effect secured the </span><span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note also that the sureties or bondsmen
under the bond included not only Milagros <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> who
was party-plaintiff below, but also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>third
person, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Calonzo</span>
who was <u>not</u> a party-litigant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Yang never put in issue the financial capability of these two
(2) sureties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the
approval of the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond by respondent judge,
before whom it was presented and who was in a better position than this Court
to appreciate the financial standing of the sureties, can <span class="SpellE">scarely</span>
be questioned as a grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The other objections to
the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond are equally </span>lacking in
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the other
respondent, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>, did not act as surety on
the same bond as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his wife did, does not
affect the validity or the sufficiency of that bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would appear to the benefit of petitioner
that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Calonzo</span>
signed up as the other or second surety or bondsman on that bond, since
petitioner thereby acquired a right of recourse not only against the respondent
spouses but also against a third person, not a party to the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the </span>failure of the
<span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond to state expressly that it was
"conditioned for the return of the property to the defendant, if the
return thereof be adjudged,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
is not fatal to the validity of the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
bond put up by Milagros <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> and <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bayani</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>L. <span class="SpellE">Calonzo</span>
stated that it was given "under the condition that [they] will pay all the
costs, which may be adjudged to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">said
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">defendants and all damages which
said defendants may sustain by reason of the order of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>,
if the court shall finally adjudge that the plaintiffs were not entitled
thereto."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> We believe that the condition of the bond
given in this case substantially complied with the requirement of Section 2,
Rule 60.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the provisions of
Rule 60, Section 2 of the Revised Rules </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

13.0pt">the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond was given may be regarded
as having become part of the bond and as having been imported thereunto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All the particular conditions prescribed in
Section 2, Rule 60, although not written in the bond in printer's ink, will be
read into the bond in determining the scope and content of the liability of the
sureties or bondsmen under that bond.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also contends that since the respondent spouses are
not the registered owners of the cargo trucks involved, the writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> should not have been issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not think so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provisional remedy of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
is in the nature of a <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> action and the
applicant who seeks immediate possession of the property involved need not be
holder of the legal title to the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It suffices, if at the time he applies for a writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>,
he is, in the words of Section 2, Rule 60, "entitled to the possession
thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner further urges
that the dropping of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Yaphockun</span> as
party-defendant </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the amended complaint was fraudulently
intended to deprive him (<span class="SpellE">Yaphockun</span>) of the right to
demand the return of the vehicles in dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The difficulty with this argument is that it is merely
question-begging.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A person in actual or
constructive possession of the goods sought to be <span class="SpellE">replevied</span>,
should of course be made a party-defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, however, the respondent spouses, as complainants in
the suit for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>, were entitled, for their own
convenience and at their own peril, to exclude or strike out the name of a
party previously <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> from the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In excluding </span>Manuel <span class="SpellE">Yaphockun</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as party-defendant
from the complaint, the respondent spouses were well within their rights; no

counsel, was served with copy of the amended complaint dropping defendant
Manuel </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Yap </span>from the
complaint on January 14, 1985 and </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">hence,

summons is to acquire jurisdiction over the person of the parties, and

the service of summons and </u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a
</span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">copy of the order of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> on January 7, 1985, defendant Thomas Yang had
already been duly served, especially so, when counsel manifested in their
comment to the opposition filed by plaintiffs that Manuel Yap has been duly
authorized to represent Thomas Yang</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

have been on guard as to the provision of Section 6, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Rule </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

is honestly believed that the five day period spoken of by the Rule begins from
the taking of the property by the sheriff and not from the service of summons
to the defendant, for even if summons was already duly served to the defendant
but the property has not yet been taken by the sheriff, the provision above
cited does not apply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is clear

the counter-<span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond on January 10, 1985, which
was denied by this court, that was three (3) days after the property was taken
on January 7, 1985 but <u>when the said defendant was dropped from </u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
