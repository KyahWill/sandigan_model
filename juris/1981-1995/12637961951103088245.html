				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review and set aside two orders of the then
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the order dated October 11,
1985, disqualifying Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz as a witness in Civil Case No. 6880 entitled
“Clarita <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span>, et al. v. Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span>” and (2) the order dated November 26, 1985, refusing
to reconsider the previous orders of disqualification and resetting the
reception of evidence for the defendants to December 19 and 20, 1985 with a
warning that should defendants’ witnesses fail to appear in court on said date,
they will be deemed to have waived their right to be witnesses in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents filed Civil Case No. 6880 with the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental against herein
petitioners for Partition, Accounting, and Damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the case was raffled to Branch I
presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>,
summons was issued to the three petitioners, all at <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental which was the address indicated in
the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trying to effect service, the process server went back to
the court with the following return of service - - "served to <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> <u>not</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contacted</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span>according to Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span>, subject persons is (sic) staying in <span class="SpellE">Kabangkalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental."</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Atty. Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Alamillo</span> filed
a motion for extension to answer in behalf of the defendants, manifesting the
representation of his client Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> that she
will inform her brothers <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> about the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants, however, failed to file their answer within the
requested period and upon motion of the plaintiffs, the defendants were
declared in default, and on <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">October 5, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">, </span>a judgment by default was
promulgated by Judge <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case, however, show that a Manifestation was
filed by Atty. Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Alamillo</span> informing the court
that since he never met <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span>, who are residents
of another province, he desisted from further appearing in the case in their
behalf.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1979</st1:date>,
Atty. Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Alamillo</span> received a copy of the
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On December 7, 1979, he filed
a motion for new trial in behalf of the defendants on grounds of lack of
jurisdiction over the persons of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> who had not been
legally <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">served </span>with summons,
and, with a meritorious defense that the properties sought to be partitioned
have already been the subject of a written partition agreement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">between </span>the direct heirs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">of the late <span class="SpellE">Bernado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> who </span>are the predecessors of the parties
in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1980</st1:date>, the court granted
said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the order
granting new trial and at the same time prayed that a writ of execution be
issued but only in so far as defendant Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span>
was concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated July 21, 1981, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vamenta</span> of Branch III of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, to whom the case had been
assigned after a re-raffle, set aside the order of April 23, 1980 and directed
the execution of the October 5, 1979 decision without qualification ruling that
the petitioners' remedy should have been appeal rather than new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their motion for reconsideration having been denied on <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1981</st1:date>, the defendants, now
petitioners, brought the case to this Court through a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
G.R. No. 57771, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span>, et al., Petitioners versus Hon. <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vamenta</span>, et al., Respondents."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1982</st1:date>,
this Court rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, <span class="GramE">Our</span> resolution dismissing
the petition is hereby reconsidered; the petition is granted; and the order
dated <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1981</st1:date>, is set
aside while that of <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1980</st1:date>,
is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">revived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No special pronouncement as to costs." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 21)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the pre-trial and trial of Civil case No. 6880 was
scheduled on October 9, 10, and 11, 1985 before Branch XXXVI of the Regional
Trial Court, presided by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The defendants, (now petitioners), presented Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz as their first
witness.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents, through
counsel, moved for her disqualification as a witness on the ground that having
been declared in default, Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> has lost
her standing in court and she cannot be allowed to participate in all
proceedings therein, even as a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The court, through the respondent judge, sustained the respondents'
contention and disqualified her from testifying.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners, through counsel, moved for a reconsideration of
the ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1985</st1:date>,
the lower court issued an order denying reconsideration of its Order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1985</st1:date> disqualifying
Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz
as a witness in Civil Case No. 6880.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili's</span> competence
as a witness is put in issue by the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 18, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court states who are
qualified to be witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 18.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Witnesses;</u> <u>their</u>
<u>qualifications</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- Except
as provided in the next succeeding section, all persons who, having organs of
sense, can perceive, and perceiving, can make known their perception to others,
may be witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither parties nor
other persons interested in the outcome of a case shall be excluded; nor those
who have been convicted of crime; nor any person on account of his opinion on
matters of religious belief."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The generosity with which the Rule allows people to testify is
apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Interest in the outcome of a
case, conviction of a crime unless otherwise provided by law, and religious
belief are not grounds for disqualification.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sections 19 and 20 of Rule 130 provide for specific
disqualifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 19
disqualifies those who are mentally incapacitated and children whose tender age
or immaturity renders them incapable of being witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 20 provides for disqualification
based on conflicts of interest or on relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 21 provides for disqualifications
based on privileged communications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Section 15 of Rule 132 may not be a rule on disqualification of
witnesses but it states the grounds when a witness may be impeached by the
party against whom he was called.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no provision of the Rules disqualifying parties declared
in default from taking the witness stand for non-disqualified parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law does not provide default as an
exception.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The specific enumeration of
disqualified witnesses excludes the operation of causes of disability other
than those mentioned in the Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
a maxim of recognized utility and merit in the construction of statutes that an
express exception, exemption, or saving clause excludes other exceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(In Re Estate of Enriquez, 29 Phil. 167) As a
general rule, where there are express exceptions these comprise the only
limitations on the operation of a statute and no other exception will be
implied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sutherland on Statutory
Construction, Fourth Edition, Vol. 2A, p. 90) The Rules should not be
interpreted to include an exception not embodied therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents, however, cite Section 2, Rule 18 on Defaults, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 2.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Effect</u> <u>of</u> <u>order</u>
<u>of</u> <u>default</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-
Except as provided in section 9 of Rule 13, a party declared in default <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">shall not be entitled to notice of subsequent
proceedings nor to take part in the trial."</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">They advance the argument that to allow
Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> to stand as witness would be to
permit a party in default "to take part in the trial."</p>

<p class="BODY">An explanation of the Rule is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Loss of standing in court is the consequence of an order of
default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a party declared in
default is considered out of court and cannot appear therein, adduce evidence,
and be heard and for that reason he is not entitled to notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Rule 18, Rules of Court;
Lim <span class="SpellE">Toco</span> v.</span> Go Fay, 80 Phil. 166) However,
"loss of standing" must be understood to mean only the forfeiture of
one's rights as a party litigant, contestant or legal adversary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A party in default loses his right to present
his defense, control the proceedings, and examine or cross-examine
witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He has no right to expect
that his pleadings <span class="GramE">would be</span> acted upon by the court
nor may he object to or refute evidence or motions filed against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the rule, however, which
contemplates a disqualification to be a witness or a deponent in a case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Default does not make him an incompetent.</p>

<p class="BODY">As opposed to a party litigant, a witness is merely a beholder, a
spectator or onlooker, called upon to testify to what he has seen, heard, or
observed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, he takes no active
part in the contest of rights between the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cast in the limited role of witness, a party
in default cannot be considered as "taking part in the trial".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He remains suffering the effects of an order
of default.</p>

<p class="BODY">A party in default may thus be cited as a witness by his
co-defendants who have the standing and the right to present evidence which the
former may provide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The incidental
benefit giving the party in default the opportunity to present evidence which
may eventually redound to his advantage or bring about a desired result,
through his co-defendants, is of minor consequence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of greater concern or importance in allowing the presence of
Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> as a witness in the case at bar, is
the preservation of the right of petitioners <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> to
secure the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence in their
behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To reject Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili's</span> presentation of testimonial evidence would be to
treat <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
as if they too were in default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
no reason why the latter should also be made to bear the consequences of
Perfecta's omission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, we cannot
deprive <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
of the only instrument of proof available to them, as Perfecta alone has been
in possession and administration of the property in question and more than
anybody else she can provide vital evidence to buttress their claim.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is
hereby GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order of the
respondent court disqualifying Perfecta <span class="SpellE">Cavili</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz as a witness in Civil Case No. 6880 is hereby SET
ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case is remanded to the court
a quo for further proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
temporary restraining order issued on <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="1">January
 6, 1986</st1:date> is LIFTED.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
