It was noted that these cases constituted an exception to the rule in the Labor
Code that a person dismissed for cause is not entitled to separation pay, the
exception being based on considerations of equity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court observed, however, that the cited
decisions had "not been consistent as to the justification for the grant
of separation pay in the amount and rate of such award," and pointed out
the need for a re-examination of the policy therein enunciated, in order to
rationalize the exception, "to make it fair to both labor and management,
especially to labor." The Court then proceeded to lay down the following
principles,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
which are hereby reaffirmed:</p>

<blockquote>"There should be no question that where it comes to such valid
but not iniquitous causes as failure to comply with work standards, the grant
of separation pay to the dismissed employee may be both just and compassionate,
particularly if he has worked for some time with the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, a subordinate who has
irreconcilable policy or personal differences with his employer may be validly
dismissed for demonstrated loss of confidence, which is an allowable
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A working mother who has to be
frequently absent because she has also to take care of her child may also be
removed because of her poor attendance, this being another authorized
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not the employee's fault
if he does not have the necessary aptitude for his work but on the other hand
the company cannot be required to maintain him just the same at the expense of
the efficiency of its operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He too
may be validly replaced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these and
similar circumstances, however, the award to the employee of separation pay
would be sustainable under the social justice policy even if the separation is
for cause.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But where the cause of the separation is more serious than mere
inefficiency, the generosity of the law must be more discerning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt it is compassionate to give
separation pay to a salesman if he is dismissed for his inability to fill his
quota but surely he does not deserve such generosity if his offense is
misappropriation of the receipts of his sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is no longer mere incompetence but clear dishonesty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A security guard found sleeping on the job is
doubtless subject to dismissal but may be allowed separation pay since his
conduct, while inept, is not depraved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But if he was in fact not really sleeping but sleeping with a prostitute
during his tour of duty and in the company premises, the situation is changed
completely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not only
inefficiency but immorality and the grant of separation pay would be entirely
unjustified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We hold that henceforth separation pay shall be allowed as a
measure of social justice only in those instances where the employee is validly
dismissed for causes other than serious misconduct or those reflecting on his
moral character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the reason for
the valid dismissal is, for example, habitual intoxication or an offense
involving moral turpitude, like theft or illicit sexual relations with a fellow
worker, the employer may not be required to give the dismissed employee
separation pay, or financial assistance, or whatever other name it is called,
on the ground of social justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A contrary rule would, as the petitioner correctly argues, have the
effect of rewarding rather than punishing the erring employee for his
offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And we do not agree that the
punishment is his dismissal only and that the separation pay has nothing to do
with the wrong he has committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of
course it has.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the employee
who steals from the company is granted separation pay even as he is validly
dismissed, it is not unlikely that he will commit a similar offense in his next
employment because he thinks he can expect a little leniency if he is again
found out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This kind of misplaced
compassion is not going to do labor in general any good as it will encourage
the infiltration of its ranks by those who do not deserve the protection and
concern of the Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The policy of social justice is not intended to countenance
wrongdoing simply because it is committed by the underprivileged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At best it may mitigate the penalty but it
certainly will not condone the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Compassion for the poor is an imperative of every humane society but
only when the recipient is not a rascal claiming an undeserved privilege.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Social justice cannot be permitted to be the
refuge of scoundrels any more than can equity be an impediment to the
punishment of the guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those who
invoke social justice may do so only if their hands are clean and their motives
blameless and not simply because they happen to be poor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This great policy of our Constitution is not
meant for the protection of those who have proved they are not worthy of it,
like the workers who have tainted the cause of labor with the blemishes of
their own character."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In light of the foregoing propositions, it is evident that the
grant of separation pay to the private respondents is unjustified, they having
been dismissed for causes reflecting on their moral character.</p>
