				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The factual background is not disputed. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Inocian</span> was the owner of several lots in <st1:place><st1:placename>Maria</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Teresa</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Village</st1:placename></st1:place>
in Guadalupe, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>. Roberto <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
was his real estate broker. In 1971, <span class="SpellE">Inocian</span> and <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> sold what was identified as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1 to Mariano <span class="SpellE">Suson</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and, later that same year, the adjacent lot, identified as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2, to Jesus <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>. <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3 had previously been sold to Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Suson</span> built a house on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2,
believing it to be <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1. <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
built his own house on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3, believing it to be <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2. When the mistakes were discovered in 1975, the parties conferred and sought
a solution. They failed. Eventually, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> sued <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, resulting in <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> buying <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span> lot as a
compromise.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Kho</span> thereafter filed a complaint for recovery and
damages against <span class="SpellE">Inocian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>. <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> filed a
cross-claim against his co-defendants.</p>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kho</span> is now before us, claiming that the
respondent court erred "in making the following presumptions and
conclusions."</p>

<blockquote>(a) When <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> negotiated with <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> and <span class="SpellE">Inocian</span> to buy a lot
in MTV II in 1971, it was his intention to buy <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3 and
no other.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> could not have contemplated
buying the real lot (now occupied by <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>) since he
knew then that it was already sold to the cross-claimant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) That no sale of the lot occupied by <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>
in favor of <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> was contemplated or perfected in 1971
is demonstrated by the fact that <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> knew right then
that the property was already owned by <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition will fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised are mainly factual. In a petition for <u>certiorari</u>
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, only questions of law may be raised.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
A review is not a matter of right but of sound judicial discretion and will be
granted only when there are special and important reasons therefore.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
We see none in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of fact of the respondent court, which in the main
affirmed those of the trial court, appear to be based on substantial evidence.
They will therefore not be disturbed in this review. <span class="SpellE">Inocian</span>
has not appealed and in his memorandum practically concedes such findings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
So has <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>, who also prays for the denial of the petition.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> has been dropped as a respondent on the
petitioner's own motion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kho</span> maintains that he could not have
bought <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3 because it had already been sold to <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>. This is absolutely true, which is the reason why <span class="SpellE">Inocian</span> and <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, who
misrepresented it to him as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2, were sentenced to pay
him damages. <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> also holds that the only lot that
could be sold to him at that time was <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2, which is
what he bought. This contention is erroneous because <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2 had already been sold at that time to <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues that even if <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>
had acted in good faith when he built his house on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2, he should still be liable in damages to him because it was because of <span class="SpellE">Suson's</span> mistake that he himself was led to build his house
on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3. He himself refuted this argument when he
testified on direct examination as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Q. In other words, you were the one who pointed to the carpenter
where to build the house?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. And you pointed out as bearing the property where the house of <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> was constructed because the house was already there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. Even if <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> did not have his house
there I have to construct my house on the lot because that was the same lot
which was indicated to me.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kho</span> also speculates that if he had not
been able to purchase <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 3 from <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>,
he would have been in the same situation as <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>,
with a house on another person's lot. In these circumstances, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> could not have been legally required to transfer her
lot to <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> because she was the original purchaser.
Yet, in the questioned decision, although the situation between <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> and <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> is no different, <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> is required to transfer <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2 to
<span class="SpellE">Suson</span>, in whose name its registration is ordered.</p>

<p class="BODY">The problem between <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> and <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> is different. <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> was the
only purchaser of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2 although it was identified as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1. The lower court found that what <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> purchased was <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
3 although it was identified as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2. <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
3 was therefore involved in a double sale, first to <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
and then to <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
legally has precedence, having the title and registration over the lot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner claims that the transfer certificates of title
issued to the parties over their respective lots are the best evidence of what
they had purchased. As he was the registered buyer of what was described in TCT
No. 50806 as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2, then <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2
should be recognized as belonging to him, not <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">He invokes the rule, but it is not without exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court found that <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>
could not have bought <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1 because it was near a creek
and already partly eroded. It was not suitable for residential purposes. Proof
of his real intention was the fact that he constructed his house on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2, which was what he believed he had purchased. TCT No. 51965 referred, indeed,
to <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1 and not <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2. But in
case of mistakes of this nature, the registration may be rectified and the
certificates of title corrected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> cannot claim that
his intention to buy <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2 is also evidenced by the fact
that he built his house on that lot. In fact, he built on <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
3, not <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Bijis</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court declared:</p>

<blockquote>It appears that the Court of Appeals made no findings or mention of
the facts obtaining in the record, supported by documentary evidence, and found
out by the trial court, which clearly indicate that there has been an erroneous
exchange in the numbers of the two lots in the different deeds that had been
executed. These facts are, namely: although the lot mortgaged by Pedro Medina
to the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Estate Fund for the amount of P8,400.00
was designated as Lot No. 1357, the report of appraisal in connection with the
mortgage describes the lot as consisting of 627 square meters in area and
located in the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>, Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, with improvements consisting of a 2-story house of
strong materials and a <span class="SpellE">camarin</span>, which features
distinguish Lot No. 1155 from Lot 1357 located in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Bagbag</span> municipality of Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>;
the petitioner, with the knowledge of the respondents and without objection on
their part, took possession of the said Lot No. 1155 and in the concept of
owner collected rentals from the Bureau of Lands office and the Rosario
Institute, then occupants of the building; Lot No. 1155 with its improvements
had at the time of the mortgage to the San <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
Estate an appraised value of P10,830.00, while Lot No. 1357 was assessed at
P280.00 only, with an improvement consisting of a <span class="SpellE">nipa</span>
house valued at P200.00; and when the parties discovered that there has been a
mistake in the designation of the numbers of the lots, they attempted to
rectify that error by executing instruments of sale in favor of each other over
the two lots under dispute. Exhibit 18, Annex "N" of Petitioners
Brief is a "Deed of Absolute Sale" signed by Luis <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>
Bid is conveying to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and the other
respondents Lot 1357, while Exhibit 3, Annex "O" of the same Brief is
entitled "<span class="SpellE">Extradudicial</span> Partition with
Sale" signed by the <span class="SpellE">Legaspis</span> deeding to the
herein petitioner Lot 1155. Although the documents mentioned, which were
supposed to have been drawn on the same day, are in the form of sale, the
obvious intention of the parties was to exchange the two lots with each other.
This can be gleaned from the fact that the price mentioned in each of the
documents is the same --P2,000.00--notwithstanding the disparity between the
properties in their respective values owing to the difference in their location
and improvements.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To our minds, the foregoing facts over which the appellate court
failed to make any findings amply support the contention that the petitioner is
the owner of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1155 and the respondents are the owners
of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1357 as found out and correctly adjudged by the
trial court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The mere mention of Lot No. 1357 in the contract to sell, the final
deed of sale and the certificate of title in favor of the herein petitioner is
not conclusive that the property sold to him is the lot located at barrio <span class="SpellE">Bagbag</span>. For as has been elucidated, the parties meant <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1155 at the <span class="SpellE"><u>poblacion</u></span>. Article 1370 of the
Civil Code provides that if the words in a contract appear to be contrary to
the evident intention of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above doctrine to the case at bar, we declare with
the respondent court that despite the erroneous registration of their
respective lots, what <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> bought was <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2 and what <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> bought was <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
3, although <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> had to yield to the superior right
thereto of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, who had earlier bought and registered
the lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of this conclusion, it is no longer necessary to discuss
the petitioner's contention that <span class="SpellE">Suson</span> was a builder
in bad faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED and the challenged decision of
the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED, with costs against the petitioner. It is so
ordered.</p>
