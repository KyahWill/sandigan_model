				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ROGELIO FRANCISCO, BALDOMINO FRANCISCO AND JOHN DOE AND PETER DOE, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">No less than a miracle could have saved Demetrio de la Cruz as he
lay sprawled on the ground with blood still oozing from his head.  He was dead, of course.  There had been no miracle to stanch the
blood that inexorably drained his life on the spot where he had fallen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequent police investigation pointed to four men as his
killers, namely, Rogelio Francisco, Baldomino Francisco, Johnny Claro, and
Boyet Francisco.  All of them were
charged with murder<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
but only the first two could be tried as the other two were (and are presumably
still) at large.  After trial, Rogelio
Francisco and Baldomino Francisco were convicted by the trial judge, who
sentenced them to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and to pay civil damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">They are now on appeal before this Court and claim that the trial
judge relied erroneously on the evidence of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing occurred on February 23, 1990, at about 8:00 p.m., at
Barangay Muson, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.  The prosecution and the defense naturally had conflicting versions of
the incident, both of which, as the Court finds, are flawed with several
noticeable inconsistencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution tended to show that in the
afternoon of the said date, the appellants and their co-accused planned to
murder De la Cruz, who had earlier incurred their ire when, as barangay <i>tanod</i>,
he berated them for being drunk and disorderly.  The plan was to lure him to the ricefield, where they could maul
and kill him.  To this end, they would
create a commotion outside De la Cruz's house, causing their intended victim to
come out and scold them again.  They
would then gang up on him until he pursued them to the ricefield where he was
to be slain.</p>

<p class="BODY">Enrique Antonio testified that in the afternoon of February 23,
1990, he and Rogelio Franscisco went to the house of Baldomino Francisco, where
they, together with Johnny Claro and Boyet Francisco drank gin.  It was there that he heard them plotting to
kill De la Cruz.  He saw them later make
the disturbance in front of the victim's house and then maul De la Cruz, who
was able to break free and run to his house to get his carbine.  The accused lay in wait in the ricefield,
where they expected De la Cruz to follow.  When he appeared, Rogelio Francisco hacked him in the head with a big
bolo (called a "halabas").  Johnny Claro wrested the rifle from him and hit him twice as he lay on
the ground.  Baldomino Francisco and
Boyet Francisco then kicked the victim's body several times before all four of
them scampered away.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Antonio claimed he saw the killing as he hid behind a tree.  He did not intervene because he was afraid
of the accused.  He did not report to
the police until after four days, for the same reason and also because he said
he did not know the barangay chairman.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Alvina de la Cruz, the victim's widow, declared under oath that
she saw from her window all four accused attack her husband after making loud
noises in front of their house.  All of
them were intoxicated.  She also heard
Rogelio Francisco tell his companions to "hurry up, for sure that person
will follow us," referring to her husband.  She said the resentment of the accused for her husband's acts as
barangay <i><span style="">tanod</span></i><span style=""> </span>was the motive for his killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Rico Mateo was the <i><span style="">tanod
</span></i>Alvina called to follow her husband when he went in pursuit of his
attackers.  This witness said that upon
reaching the ricefield, he switched on his high-powered flashlight and saw
Rogelio Francisco hack De la Cruz in the head, to be followed by Johnny Claro,
who shot the victim twice in the head when he was prostrate on the ground.  Mateo reported the killing to the police
that same night.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Juanito Sacdalan, who conducted the autopsy, testified that
the victim sustained two gunshot wounds and one lacerated wound in the head
that caused his death.  The victim also
had abrasions in the face.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Police Corporal Dante Evangelista investigated the case and found
the <i><span style="">halabas</span></i><span style="">, </span>on the handle of which he imprinted
his initials for identification.  The
victim's carbine was never recovered.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense had a different story to tell through both Baldomino
Francisco and Rogelio Francisco.  They
were corroborated by Rogelio's wife, Liberty Francisco, and their son Rogelio,
Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">Baldomino swore that prior to the killing, he and his co-accused,
together with Enrique Antonio, were passing by the house of De la Cruz when the
latter attacked him.  He had made a joke
about "balut na bakal" that annoyed De la Cruz, who kicked him in the
stomach.  Baldomino fell to the ground
and De la Cruz continued kicking him and then began to strangle him.  Rogelio came to his rescue and tried to pry
loose De la Cruz's fingers from Baldomino's neck.  De la Cruz then turned on him and also tried to strangle him.  Abruptly, De la Cruz released Rogelio and
ran to his house, saying he would get his gun.  All four of them then fled in fright.  On his way home, Baldomino heard the two gunshots that killed De la
Cruz.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Rogelio Francisco said that they did have a drinking session in
his house in the afternoon of February 23, 1990.  When they ran out of gin, they consumed a case of beer and then
went out to buy another one.  It was on
their way back that he saw Baldomino being attacked by De la Cruz, whom he and
his companions tried to appease.  When
De la Cruz ran to his house to get his gun, he and his four companions
fled.  He heard the gunshots when he was
already in his house and told his wife that his companions had already been
shot.  Minutes later, he saw Johnny
Claro running toward him and carrying a gun.  Claro told him to come along with him and he obeyed because Claro told
him he had killed De la Cruz and he was afraid Claro would also shoot him.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Rogelio, Jr. sought to corroborate but instead contradicted his
father's statement that he was home when he heard the shots.  The son said his father was out at the
time.  The boy's testimony may be
discarded because he admitted that he was coached by his mother on the
testimony he was to give.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The mother, Liberty, sought to exculpate her husband and pointed
to Johnny Claro as the killer who admitted his crime to her.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There are weak points in the evidence of both sides, but we find
that the evidence for the prosecution far outweighs that of the defense.  We are not unmindful of the argument that
Enrique Antonio could not have seen every single detail of the attack on De la
Cruz in the unlit ricefield at eight o'clock in the evening and that he might
have testified for the prosecution to save his own skin (as he might otherwise
have also been prosecuted).  We also
wonder how the killers could not have noticed Federico Mateo, who claimed to be
watching them from a distance of 25 meters with a high-powered flashlight, and
why they did not come after him to silence him as a potential eyewitness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the bare denials of the accused are
none-too-convincing either, in light particularly of the events that preceded
the killing and their admitted intoxication on that occasion.  Their corroborating witnesses have not
helped but in fact have even prejudiced them.  Rogelio's assertion that he was forced by Johnny Claro to go with him is
unbelievable, as unbelievable as the son who contradicted him and the wife who
coached the boy on what to say at the trial.  Baldomino's tale of the victim's attack on him while he was with four
other companions, and his pitiful cries for mercy, have not moved this
Court.  All told, we find that the
prosecution has adequately proved its case against the appellants and
established beyond the whisper of a doubt their participation in the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied that there was indeed a conspiracy between the
four accused that was decided upon during their drinking session in Rogelio's
house and carried out as planned in the ricefield that same night.  A conspiracy exists when two or more persons
come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit
it.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
From the time they created a commotion in front of De la Cruz's house until the
time they killed him in the ricefield, it is plain that the accused were acting
in concert to carry out their common plot.</p>

<p class="BODY">But we are not prepared to accept the qualifying circumstances
alleged in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is our view that there was no evident premeditation as this
circumstance requires the concurrence of three requisites, to wit:  1) the time when the offender determined to
commit the crime; 2) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to
his determination; and 3) a sufficient lapse of time between the determination
and execution, to allow him to reflect upon the consequence of his act.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The third requisite is missing in this case because it does not appear that the
accused had sufficient time (and even the mental capacity, considering their
intoxication) to reflect on the nature and consequences of the crime they were
planning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither was there <i><span style="">alevosia</span></i><span style="">, </span>which exists, according to the
Revised Penal Code, "when the offender commits any of the crimes against
the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof which
tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself
arising from the defense which the offended party might make."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that De la Cruz was aware of the danger he
was facing as he pursued the accused with his rifle.  That was the reason he was carrying the shotgun, which he ran to
his house to get after he was manhandled by the accused.  When Baldomino stepped from behind the tree
and hacked him with the bolo, De la Cruz was not really so much surprised as
merely <i><span style="">out­-maneuvered</span></i><span style="">.  </span>In
fact, everyone was on the alert at the time, each waiting for the planned
encounter, including De la Cruz.  At any
rate, it cannot be said that the accused employed means or tactics to insure
the execution of their plan without risk to themselves from any act the pursuing
and armed De la Cruz might take.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we also discount the allegation of abuse of
superiority.  The mere fact that there
were four assailants against the lone victim does not signify abuse of superior
strength.  It must actually be shown
that superiority was indeed abused, but there is no such showing here.  On the contrary, the evidence shows that De
la Cruz was felled by the very first hack made by Baldomino Francisco, making
the victim virtually defenseless and dying from that lone blow.  There was no need for the other accused to
assist in subduing or overcoming him.  To appreciate abuse of superiority, according to People v. Flores,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
what should be considered is not that there were three, four or more assailants
of one victim but whether the aggressors took advantage of their combined strength
in order to consummate the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The consequence of these findings is that as the killing was not
attended by any of the circumstances qualifying it to murder, the accused must
be found guilty of homicide only.  The
penalty for this offense is <i>reclusion temporal</i>, which in the case at bar
must be applied in its medium period, there being no aggravating or mitigating
circumstances.  Under the Indeterminate
Sentence Law, the reduced penalty must be from <i>reclusion temporal </i>medium,
as maximum, to anywhere within the range of the penalty next lower in degree to
<i>reclusion temporal</i>, to wit, <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the decision of the trial judge is unduly long,
consisting of no less than 16 legal-size single-spaced pages.  Fifteen of these are devoted to a virtually
word-for-word summary of the testimonies of all the witnesses, without any
effort to separate the chaff from the grain.  What is worse is that the findings of the judge are confined to two
short paragraphs on the last page, and there is hardly any effort to explain
such opinion or to support it with law or jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the way to write a decision.  As we said in an earlier case,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
judges should learn to summarize, to synthesize, to simplify.  More important, judges should <i>judge</i>.  In this case, the trial judge barely
complied with the <span style="">constitutional
requirement that the factual and legal basis of the decision should be clearly
and distinctly expressed therein.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the conviction of the appellants is AFFIRMED but
for the crime of homicide only and not murder, and their penalty is reduced to
from <span style="">12 years of </span><i><span style="">prision mayor </span></i><span style="">as </span><span style="">minimum, to 17 years of </span><i><span style="">reclusion
temporal</span></i><span style="">, as </span><span style="">maximum.  All monetary awards are also affirmed except for the moral damages,
which are disallowed.  Costs against the
appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
