				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This decision provides the denouement to the dispute between the
contending parties herein which started almost two decades ago under the aegis
of Republic Act No. 875,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>otherwise
known as the Magna Carta of Labor, and culminated in the unfair labor practice
case subject of the petition at bar.  Petitioner Rizal Memorial Colleges Faculty Union (RMCFU, for short), a legitimate
labor organization affiliated with the Davao Worker's Union (DWU, for brevity),
together with the other individual petitioners who are members thereof, charge
their employer, respondent Rizal Memorial Colleges (hereinafter called RMC) and
its co-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondents for allegedly having
committed acts of interference with said workers' right to organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 15, 1970, Rodolfo Braga and Dionisio B. Jaboni,
presidents of RMCFU and DWU, respectively, sent a letter to the board of
trustees of respondent college asking for direct recognition and collective
bargaining.  Respondent Leopoldo M.
Abellera, as president of the school, replied on January 20, 1970 that the
letter would be presented to the board of trustees at its meeting on February
14, 1970.  Abellera further informed
them of the receipt of another letter from respondent Rizal Memorial Colleges
Faculty League (hereafter RMCFL) likewise requesting recognition and demanding
collective bargaining.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 26, 1970, RMCFU filed a petition for direct
certification, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>the sole and
exclusive bargaining representative, with the then Court of Industrial
Relations claiming that it was the only union in the bargaining unit and its
members constituted the majority of the faculty of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">RMC.  RMCFL intervened in said
proceedings on February 9, </span>1970, alleging that it had already filed an
application for registration as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>labor
union with the Department of Labor, further claiming that its members
constituted the majority of the teachers and instructors in RMC who were
eligible to vote in a certification election, and contending that the majority
of the members of petitioner union were not legally qualified to be union
members since they were stockholders of RMC.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 17, 1970, RMCFU staged a strike, having theretofore
filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>notice thereof on the
ninth of the same month.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>In a complaint dated March 14, 1970,
petitioner filed with the then Court of Industrial Relations an unfair labor
practice case, docketed as ULP Case No. 282, alleging that “Leopoldo M.
Abellera has initiated, dominated, assisted or contributed to the organization
of the so-called Rizal Memorial Colleges Faculty League which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is </span>composed of few teachers or
instructors employed with the respondent school for the primary purpose of
busting the FACULTY UNION and delaying its recognition by the management,"
and that the president of the petitioner union, Rodolfo D. Braga, had been
subjected to discrimination by respondent Abellera in regard to the terms and
conditions of his employment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">What ensued thereafter, according to petitioner, was the holding
of a meeting on April 4, 1970 between the striking teachers and Abellera
wherein the picketing teachers allegedly agreed to return to their classrooms,
with respondent Abellera having made, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">inter</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span><u>alia</u>, the following
commitments substantially embodied on April 6, 1970 in a "return to work

retaliatory measures against the members of the striking union by reason of any
union activities;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) -  That the employer shall not dismiss any
member of the striking union by reason of union activities and that there would
be no hiring of new teachers, unless the present teachers cannot cope up (sic)
with the work;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) -    That
job security shall be extended to the striking members of the union; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>d) -    That
the striking members shall be paid completely their salary during the entire
duration of the strike."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, however, claim that the picket lines were thereafter
lifted and the teachers returned to work, but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">when </span>the aforesaid agreement was presented to Abellera and the
board of trustees, they refused to affix their signatures thereto.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, while the public respondent agrees with the
foregoing statement of facts, private respondents vigorously deny that on April
4, 1970 there was such a conference about the strike.  They claim that "it was purely a faculty meeting that was
held on that date which dealt exclusively on the rules and regulations of the
Bureau of Private Schools and of the Rizal Memorial Colleges itself,"
hence no agreement could be said to have been arrived at.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise controverted by private respondents is the claim of
petitioners that Abellera again promised that he would take in all the striking
teachers after the second strike of the teachers commenced on June 20,
1970.  The reason advanced by the
teachers for staging this second strike was the dismissal of Abelardo Posadas,
Jr., Lilia Villanueva, Feliciano Villanueva, Abelardo Celestial and Jose
Majaducon.  Petitioners aver that they
lifted the strike on July 6, 1970 to show their good faith to Abellera who met
with their union leader and one of their lawyers, in which meeting specific
issues which could lead to the settlement of the strike were discussed.  It was also during this meeting when
Abellera was supposed to have promised to reinstate all teachers who had struck
anew.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

13.0pt">sufficiently apparent from the records as to whether such agreements
were actually made nor can we make definite findings thereon at this late
stage.  What is adequately clear to us,
however, is that a dispute between the parties resulted in the filing </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the petitioners on August 1, 1970, of
Unfair Labor Practice Case no. 296 with the former Court of Industrial
Relations based on the following grounds:  (1) refusal to recognize and bargain with </span>the complainant RMCFU;
(2) dismissal, harassment, discrimination and intimidation of RMCFU members by
Abellera; and (3) the RMC Faculty League is dominated and assisted by the
employer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">With the advent of the
Labor Code and the resultant abolition of the Court of Industrial Relations,
the aforesaid cases were transferred to Regional Office No. XI; Davao City, of
respondent National </span>Labor Relations Commission as NLRC Cases Nos.
70-ULP-XI-77 and 71-ULP-XI-77.  On
December 5, 1978, Assistant Regional Director Magno C. Cruz rendered a decision
in said cases, the decretal portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"RESPONSIVE TO ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

Colleges and Leopoldo Abellera guilty of unfair labor practice for refusal to
renew the teaching contracts of Felicidad Espino, Patrocinia de Jesus,

<p class="BODY">The assistant director found that the refusal of therein
respondents to recognize and negotiate with RMCFU during the pendency of the
petition for certification election was legal because to do so would be unfair
labor practice against RMCFL.  He
consequently ruled that unless and until RMCFU is certified as the sole and
exclusive bargaining representative of the faculty members, the employer could
not be compelled to confer with RMCFU for the execution of a collective
bargaining agreement.  Additionally, he
found that there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>insufficient
proof to support the contention that RMCFL was dominated and assisted by RMC
and Abellera.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

875, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>amended by Republic Act
No. 3350, which was then the governing legislation, the charge of unfair labor
practice was upheld but only because of the illegal dismissal of the eleven
(11) teachers named therein.  Their
dismissal, according to the assistant director, was for no other reason than
their union activities.  This finding
was made on the basis of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>letter
written by Abellera of the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"1. We have

<p class="BODY">With respect to the non-renewal of the contracts of Majaducon and
Masiglat who were also included in the above list, no unfair labor practice was
said to have been committed.  The
assistant director accepted Abellera's explanation that Majaducon's separation
from the service was due to his decision to quit teaching and appear as
collaborating counsel in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>damage
suit against former Mayor Elias B. Lopez of Davao City.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Arnaldo Masiglat, on the
other hand, was one of the faculty members who received a letter from Abellera
advising them that their teaching contracts with the school expired at the end
of school year 1969-1970 and that they were within the three-year probationary
period provided by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">law.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Abellera
stated in said letter that if they were still interested in teaching in the

certain documents to their applications.  Aside from Masiglat, the group included Pedro Pangan, Merlinda Yap,
Gladys Cayot, Valeria Mata, Paz Bayquen, Marietta Gilay, Lucita Racaza, Erlinda
Pinero, Amada Viñas and Filomena Morales.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> As held in said decision, the records of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The other petitioners who
were part-time teachers were also held to have been legally terminated and
validly replaced with full-time teachers, in accordance with Item 76 of them
same manual which expresses the desirability of employing only full-time
teachers.  A full-time teacher was </span>described
therein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>one whose total
working day is devoted to the school, has no other regular remunerative
employment, and is paid on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>regular

<p class="BODY">It was found that Virginia Aquino, Leticia Arkoncel, Josefina
Avanzado, Lydia Capili, Alberto Celestial, Sr., Linda Logan and Susan Medalla
were part-time teachers of RMC but full-time teachers in other schools.  On the other hand, Antonio Fuliga was an
employee of the City Engineer's Office and Nena Arguna was an employee of the
Bureau of Internal Revenue.  Paz Bayquen
left her job when she was called to teach in a public school; Mila Macalinao
and Angel Alvaro transferred to Cebu City; Feliciano Villanueva left for the
United States while Edgardo Buhay, a bank employee, was transferred to General
Santos City.  Rodolfo Braga went to
Manila to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">review </span>for the Bar
examinations; Shiela Buot (nee Espino) did not report for duty on the first day
of classes because she got married <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>few
weeks before and went on her honeymoon; and Abelardo Posadas, Jr. and Lilia Villanueva
were not qualified to teach as reflected in their transcripts of records.  The aforesaid considerations were submitted

<p class="BODY">No unfair labor practice was found when the respective teaching
loads of the rest of the petitioners were reduced.  The assistant director did not consider the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>harassment, relying on Item 78 of
the aforesaid manual which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"No instruction can be efficiently carried on over a
considerable period of time if the teachers carry an unusually heavy teaching
load and/or excessive number of subject preparations.  Elementary teachers shall be assigned to no more than full charge
of one class and where departmental teaching is observed, to an equivalent
load.  Secondary teachers shall be
assigned to not more than six daily forty minute periods of instruction.  In college, the normal teaching load of a full-time
instructor shall be eighteen hours a week.  The teaching load of part-time instructors who are full-time employees
outside teaching shall not exceed twelve hours a week."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Sofia Gundran now holds the position of assistant dean of the College of

<p class="BODY">Both parties not being satisfied with said decision, separate
appeals were filed with the National Labor Relations Commission.  On July 31, 1980, respondent commission
promulgated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>decision modifying
the appealed decision by completely absolving RMC and Abellera from any
liability for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unfair labor
practice.  Public respondent, holding
that there </span>was no sufficient basis for holding the employer guilty of
such illegal acts, observed that:<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the teachers mentioned in the letter of
Abellera were the ones who led the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">earlier

the refusal of the respondent Abellera to renew their contracts was motivated
by a desire to safeguard the rights of the school and its students.  Moreover, there is no actual strike wherein
it could be said that the respondent–appellants interfered with or prevented
the right of the teachers concerned from participating therein.  For this reason, we rule that there was no
sufficient basis for holding respondents–appellants guilty of an unfair labor
practice act.  However, being permanent
employees, by the non–renewal of their contracts, which is admitted by
respondents, the teachers concerned were deemed constructively dismissed
without just cause.  Under the law then
enforced, Republic Act 1052 as amended, otherwise known as the Termination Pay
Law, they are entitled to separation pay equivalent to one-month salary or
one-half month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher, a fraction
of six months or more <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">being </span>considered

<p class="BODY">A careful review of the entire records of these cases sustains
the finding that unfair labor practice was actually committed, hence respondent
commission erred in modifying the appealed decision of the assistant director
on that score.  The finding of unfair
labor practice due to the employer's refusal to renew the teaching contracts of
the eleven (11) faculty members referred to in the letter of Abellera should
not have been disturbed by public respondent.  It was established that said teachers were permanent employees who had
rendered six (6) to twenty (20) years of service.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Their permanent status notwithstanding, they were dismissed because Abellera
feared that if their contracts were renewed, there would be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>strike in the school the following
semester.  This is indisputably an
unwarranted interference with the right of workers to self-organization and to
engage in concerted activities.  An
apprehension that there might be a future strike in the school is not a ground
for dismissal of the workers.  While a
strike may result in hardships or prejudice to the school and the studentry,
the employer is not without recourse.  If the employer feels that the action is tainted with illegality, the
law provides the employer with ample remedies to protect his interests.  Decidedly, dismissal of employees in
anticipation of an exercise of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>constitutionally
protected right is not one of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can we accept respondent commission's theory, considering
the positive factual findings thereon, that there was no actual strike hence it
supposedly could not be said that the respondent school interfered with or
prevented the right of the teachers concerned from participating therein.  Furthermore, the existence of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>strike was not of such pervasive
significance because it is indubitable that the employees concerned were
dismissed by reason of their union activities.  No other reason is suggested by the facts of these cases which would
support <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>contrary conclusion,
especially if we consider that the teachers concerned were the ones who led the
earlier strike.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The finding that unfair labor
practice was committed should also cover the case of Majaducon whose contract </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">not renewed.  Not only was he
listed in the letter of Abellera which, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">earlier stated, was
the basis for the finding of unfair labor practice, but no sufficient ground to
validly dismiss him was established.  Abellera claimed that Majaducon stopped teaching on his own volition
supposedly because when he discovered that Majaducon was appearing as
collaborating lawyer in a case against the former mayor, Majaducon was reminded
that the school owed favors to the city government and the city major hence the
school had to maintain cordial relations with them.  Eventually, Majaducon was asked to make a choice whether to
continue as a faculty </span>member or to withdraw as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>lawyer against the mayor.  Such compulsion to make an unnecessary choice placed undue and
unjustified pressure on the employee who otherwise would not have thought of
leaving his employment as a teacher.  There was no showing whatsoever that Majaducon's work as counsel
interfered with his duties as a teacher.  Majaducon’s cessation from employment could not, therefore, be
considered as voluntary on his part and was in the nature of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contri</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">v</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ance to effect a
dismissal without cause.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The case of Arnaldo
Masiglat is different.  Although he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">one of the teachers listed in the aforesaid letter of Abellera, the
ground for dismissing him appears to be tenable.  He was one of those teachers who were advised by Abellera of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">expiration of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">their teaching contracts hence it was within the discretion of the
school to terminate his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">services.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">No
proof establishing his permanent status appears from the records, hence the
termination of his employment was not due to dismissal but because of the
expiration of his contract.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">With respect to the other
petitioners who were allegedly illegally dismissed, the records do not reveal
any act of unfair labor practice.  No
countervailing evidence </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">presented to rebut the proof submitted by
respondent RMC showing lawful causes for dismissing them.  Neither was there any substantial evidence
that they were dismissed for their union activities.  The suspicion that they were dismissed for such reasons, when
coupled with other facts which in themselves might have been <u>inadequate</u>
to support an adverse finding against the employer, may suffice to sustain </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">finding that the employer violated the provisions of the law.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

however, absent with respect to them.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Since, as a rule
applicable to these cases, the Court cannot take cognizance of factual issues,
and generally the findings of the administrative bodies which decided these
cases are binding on us, no evidence to prove the other </span>allegations of
the parties can be adduced or accepted in the present posture of this
proceeding.  Thus, we cannot pass on the
contention that RMC was guilty of unfair labor practice for dealing with the
teachers "one by one during the existence of the labor dispute and
discouraging their union activities by publishing letters of union members who
resigned."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
