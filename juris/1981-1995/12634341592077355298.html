				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner seeks to annul an order of demolition, issued long
after the finality of the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) affirming
the ruling of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) in an ejectment case solely on
the ground that the said case was incipiently and fatally flawed as it was not
brought against the real party in interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Resolution of 27 June 1987, this Court ordered the
respondents to comment on the petition and issued a temporary restraining order
enjoining respondent Judge from enforcing the order of demolition which he
issued on 27 February 1987 in Civil Case No. C-10086.<i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">After the private respondent filed his Comment and the petitioner
submitted his reply thereto, this Court gave due course to the petition and
required the <span style="">parties </span>to submit
their respective Memoranda which they subsequently did.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pleadings disclose the following facts:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent is the owner of a parcel of land located in
Maypajo, Kalookan City otherwise known as the Do√±a Leoncia <span style="">Subdivision.  One of the lessees therein is Antonia Lumbang.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 May 1979, private respondent filed a complaint for
ejectment against Antonia Lumbang with the City Court of Kalookan which was
docketed as Civil Case No. 13199 and raffled off to Branch II thereof.  On 22 March 1982, said court handed down a
decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
against Lumbang, the dispositive portion of which <span style="">reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered for the plaintiff,
ordering the defendant or anyone claiming right under her, to:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 1.8pt;">1.  V<span style="">aca</span>te the premises <span style="">in </span>question subject of this litigation
and surrender possession thereof to the plaintiff;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 1.8pt;">3.  Pay the costs of the suit.</p>

<blockquote>Counterclaim interposed
by the defendant is hereby dismissed for lack of merit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The decision reveals that herein
petitioner testified in said case; such testimony is summarized by the court in
this manner:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Enrico Sy declared that he is presently residing at 106
Pateros St., Maypajo, Kalookan City, <u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> <u>same</u> <u>house</u> </span>which is <u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> <u>subject</u> <u>matter</u> </span><u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">this</span></u><span style=""> <u>instant</u> <u>case</u>; </span>that he was not yet born when said
house was built thereon; that he is (sic) living in said house since January
30, 1948, and presently (sic) staying thereat together with his wife, mother,
brothers and sisters; that he has no knowledge in (sic) the assessment of
properties but his house would now cost about P70,000.00 based on the costs of
materials used."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphasis <span style="">supplied)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner does not deny the allegation in paragraph 7 of the
Comment filed with this Court that he is the son of Antonia Lumbang.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Antonia Lumbang appealed the aforementioned decision to the then
Court of First Instance of Kalookan City.  The case was docketed as Civil Case No. C-10086 and was raffled off to
Branch 12 thereof.  On 29 October 1982,
said court handed down a decision<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
affirming <i>in toto </i>the appealed decision.  Consequently, the decision of the Court of First Instance became
final.  Private respondent then filed a
motion for execution which the court granted.  Pursuant thereto, the sheriff issued a Notice of Ejectment which he
served on petitioner Enrico Sy on 24 December 1986.  The latter then filed on 23 January 1987 in Civil Case No.
C-10086 (now before Branch 120 of the Regional Trial Court) a Motion to Intervene
and to Annul Decision and/or Judgment with Prayer for a Restraining Order
and/or Preliminary Injunction,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">alleging
therein that he has been the actual, legal and duly registered owner of the
house since 10 February 1976 when he bought the same from Antonia Lumbang.  In support of such statement, he attached a
copy of the Deed of Absolute Sale and tax receipts evidencing his payments of
the real estate taxes due on said house.  He further alleges that since he was not made a party in the ejectment
case, the decision therein was fatally defective since it was directed against
a person who had ceased to be a real party </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">interest; Antonia
Lumbang died on 24 February 1984.  Moreover, he posits that the City Court acquired no jurisdiction over
the case because the lot where the house </span><span style="">stands </span><span style="">is "within
the jurisdiction of the National Housing Authority." Acting on this
motion, respondent Judge Arturo A. Romero, in an order dated 9 February 1987,
granted the petitioner ten (10) days to file his complaint in intervention.  On this same date, private respondent filed
a manifestation praying that the order allowing a complaint in intervention be
recalled and an order of demolition be issued.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 February 1987, Judge Romero issued an order setting aside
the Order of 9 February 1987; denying the Motion To Annul Decision and/or
Judgment with Prayer for Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction; and
granting the motion for demolition.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of filing a motion to reconsider the said order or
appealing therefrom, petitioner filed on 15 May 1987 with the RTC of Kalookan
City a petition for prohibition with a prayer for a restraining order and/or
preliminary injunction to prevent the<span style=""> </span>enforcement
of the abovementioned 27 February 1987 Order and to annul the decision in Civil
Case No. C-10086.  This new case was
docketed as Civil Case No. C-99 and was assigned to Branch 121 of said
court.  Although no copy of that <span style="">petition was </span>attached to the instant
petition, the petitioner does not deny the private respondent's allegation in
his Comment that the former merely reiterated in the new petition the grounds
already raised in the motion to intervene and annul the decision in Civil Case
No. C-10086.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, on 29 April 1987, Deputy Sheriff Cesar L. Cruz, pursuant
to the order of respondent Judge dated 27 February 1987 in Civil Case No.
C-10086, issued a Notice of Demolition addressed to "Mrs. Antonia Lumbang
or any person claiming right under her."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 March 1988, Branch 121 of the RTC issued an order<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
in Civil Case No. C-99 denying the application for a writ of preliminary
injunction and dismissing said case on the ground that it has no authority to
interfere with the judgment of <span style="">a </span>court
of coordinate or concurrent jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of moving for a reconsideration of, appealing from or
filing a special civil action for <i><span style="">certiorari
</span></i>to nullify this order, petitioner filed on <span style="">14 </span>June 1988 the instant petition against the respondent Judge
and Sheriff.  He reiterates in this
petition the grounds upon which he anchored his motion to intervene and to
annul the decision in both Civil Cases Nos. C-10086 and C-99; he then prays
that a temporary restraining order be issued directing the respondents to
desist from further proceeding against him in Civil Case No. C-10086.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 June 1988, this Court (Second Division) issued a<span style=""> </span>resolution requiring respondents to
comment on the petition and directing the issuance of a temporary restraining
order enjoining the latter from enforcing the 27 February 1987 demolition order
issued by the respondent Judge in Civil Case No. C-10086.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the private respondent filed his Comment<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and the petitioner submitted his reply thereto, this Court gave due course to
the petition and required the parties to submit their respective Memoranda,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
which they subsequently did.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is bereft of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner took this recourse to revive his grievances in Civil
Case No. C-10086 after he allowed (a) the Order of 27 February 1987 denying his
motion to intervene and to annul the decision in said civil case and (b) the
order of Branch 121 of the RTC in Civil Case No. C-99 dismissing the same, to
separately <span style="">lapse into finality.  This petition, a special civil action for </span><i><span style="">certiorari </span></i><span style="">under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, may then be considered as a subs</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">itute
for the remedy of appeal, a right which the petitioner lost through his or his
counsel's fault.  It is settled that the
said special civil action will not lie as a substitute for </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">lost remedy of appeal.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The </span><span style="">exception </span><span style="">to this rule
is when such right to appeal was lost through no fault of the party entitled
thereto.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even granting for the sake of argument that said special civil
action may be availed of, the fact remains that the instant petition was filed
nearly one (1) year and four (4) months after the assailed order was rendered
by the respondent Judge.  An
unreasonable length of time had thus passed before the petitioner acted.  This Court will not place a premium on
apathy or sloth.  As the maxim goes, <b><i><span style="">Vigilantibus </span>et n</i></b><b><i><span style="">on </span>dormientibus jura subveniunt </i></b>--
The laws aid those who are vigilant, not those who sleep oh their rights.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <i><span style="">Allied Leasing
&amp; Finance Corp. vs. Court of Appeals</span></i><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court, speaking through Mr.
Justice Hugo E. Gutierrez, Jr., held:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Rule 65 of the Rules of Court does not specify any period for
the filing of the petition for <i><span style="">certiorari
</span></i>and <i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style="">.  </span>(Contreras
vs. Villaraza, 99 SCRA 329 [1980].  We
have consistently ruled that a pleading filed under Rule 65 should be within a
reasonable period of time.  Thus, we stated
that 'the yardstick to measure the timeliness <span style="">of a petition for </span><i><span style="">certiorari
</span></i><span style="">is the </span><i><span style="">reasonableness </span></i><span style="">of the duration of time that had expired from
the commission of the acts complained of up to the institution of the
proceedings to annul the same' (San Juan vs. Cuento, 160 SCRA 277 [1988],
citing Cortez v. CFI of Cadiz, 52 Phil. 214 [1928]; Centenera v. Yatco, 106
Phil. 1064 [1960]; Province of Misamis Occidental v. Catolico, 23 SCRA 1295
[1968]; Toledo v. Pardo, 118 SCRA 566 [1982])."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, even if We disregard the foregoing exposition, the fact
remains that it is not actually the 27 February 1987 Order of the respondent
Judge that lies at the bottom of the instant petition, but rather, it <span style="">is </span>the 29 October 1982 decision in
Civil<span style=""> </span>Case No. C-10086 affirming
the 22 March 1982 decision of the City Court of Kalookan City in Civil Case No.
13199 -- which City Court decision petitioner claims to be null and void for
having been directed against a defendant who was no longer the real party in
interest as the house in question was earlier sold to the petitioner -- which
serves as basis for the same.  This
theory <span style="">is </span>not worthy of any
consideration for, in the first place, if indeed the petitioner had purchased
the house from his mother Antonia Lumbang -- a fact he deliberately suppressed
in his pleadings -- long before the filing of the ejectment case, he should
have intervened in the said case to assert his ownership of the house.  As it happened, he merely testified for his
mother and failed to unequivocally assert his ownership over the house.  The so-called deed of sale in his favor was
not even offered in evidence in the said case.  On the contrary, his mother remained headstrong in her claim that she
paid the rentals for the premises until the private respondent refused to
accept payments upon the filing of the ejectment case; thereafter, she averred
that she just deposited the rentals in a bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portion of her testimony as summarized <span style="">by </span>the <span style="">City Court </span>is <span style="">as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x that she has been paying rentals  to the owner of the lot at the rate of
P14.90 a month, and knows Ramon Caba√±ero since his childhood; x x x that she
could not remember her last rental payment and has not been paying the same
since the filing of this case because plaintiff refused to accept it; so she
deposited her rental in a bank; <span style="">x x
x"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioner's failure to intervene in
Civil Case No. 13199 or even produce the so-called deed of sale in his favor at
the time he testified therein, coupled with the foregoing testimony of his
mother, cast serious doubt on the so-called deed of sale which surfaced for the
first time when he filed on 23 January 1987 a motion to intervene and annul the
judgment in Civil Case No. C-10086.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> His
claim then cannot disturb the settled rule that a judgment in an ejectment case
binds not only the defendant but also those who have claims against the former;
this is because no one may assert a right superior to the rights of a defendant
in an ejectment suit.  In the instant
case, the petitioner's rights are limited to those which may be exercised by a
mere sublessee or assignee; and even if he were not impleaded as a
co-defendant, he is bound by the judgment against his mother Antonia Lumbang.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, although the decision in the ejectment case binds the
petitioner, the execution thereof, or the issuance of a demolition order, falls
within the jurisdiction of the City Court, now Metropolitan Trial Court, of
Kalookan City which rendered the decision in Civil Case<span style=""> </span>No. 13199.  In an
ejectment case, the appellate court which affirms a decision brought before it
on appeal cannot decree its execution in the guise of an execution of the
affirming decision.  The only exception
to that is when said appellate court grants an execution pending appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of </span><i>City
of Manila vs. Court of Appeals</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">this Court ruled:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The rule is that if the judgment of the metropolitan trial
court is appealed to the regional trial court and the decision of the latter <span style="">is </span>itself elevated to the Court of
Appeals, whose decision thereafter became final, the case should be remanded
through the regional trial court to<span style=""> </span>the
metropolitan trial court for execution.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> The
only exception is the execution pending appeal, which can be issued by the
regional trial court under Sec. 8 of Rule 70 or the Court of Appeals or the
Supreme Court under Sec. <span style="">10 </span>of
the same Rule."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What Branch 120 of the Regional Trial Court of Kalookan should
have done was to make an entry of judgment in Civil Case No. C-10086 after the
decision of 29 October 1982 became final; such procedure is outlined in Section
2, Rule 36 of the Rules of Court.  Thereafter, the RTC should have remanded the case, together with the
records of Civil Case No. 13199 which were forwarded to it as a consequence of
the appeal interposed <span style="">therefrom,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to the court of origin -- the City Court
(now Metropolitan Trial Court) of Kalookan City.  The motion for execution should then be filed with the latter
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, respondent Judge should not have acted on the motion
for the execution of the 29 October 1982 decision in Civil Case No. C-10086 or
granted the motion for the issuance of an order of demolition.  Accordingly, that portion of his Order of 27
February 1987 granting the said motion is void.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is DENIED for lack of
merit.  However, in the light of the
above observations, that portion of the Order of respondent Judge of 27
February 1987 in Civil Case No. C-10086 granting the motion for an order of
demolition is set aside without prejudice to its refiling in the Metropolitan
Trial Court, unless it is already barred by Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of
