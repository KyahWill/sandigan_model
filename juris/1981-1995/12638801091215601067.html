				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> signed and filed by
petitioner himself without the assistance of counsel to nullify the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Second Division of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) of 16
February 1989 in NLRC<span style=""> </span>Case No.
NCR-00-12-04256-87 which reversed the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
of Labor Arbiter <span style="">Nieves V. de Castro of
22 September 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter ordered
the reinstatement of petitioner to his former or equivalent position with back
wages for two years without deductions computed at the rate then <span style="">existing in </span>January 1983.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In Our resolution of 8 May 1989 We required respondents to
comment on the petition, which was complied with by respondent Philippine
National Construction Corporation (PNCC), through the Office of the Government
Corporate Counsel, on 2 June 1989<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and respondent National Labor Relations Commission, through the Office of the
Solicitor General, on 23 August 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 1 September 1989 petitioner filed his Reply.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We gave due course to the petition and required the parties to
submit simultaneously their respective memoranda.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent PNCC filed its Memorandum on 15 November 1989<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
while respondent NLRC filed a manifestation and motion on 21 December 1989
praying that its comment be considered its memorandum,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
which We granted in Our resolution of 15 January 1990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed his Memorandum on 15 January
1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The material operative facts as culled from the pleadings
submitted by the parties are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was employed by PNCC as welder/heavy equipment
mechanic on a regular status from July 1975 up to October 1979 with a salary
rate of P5.00 per hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In November
1979, he <span style="">was
</span>among <span class="SpellE">PNCC's</span> employees chosen to be deployed
in its overseas construction project in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> with
a salary of US$1.70 per hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He worked
there until January 1983 when the project was completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He returned to the Philippines and since his
arrival he has neither been assigned any work nor paid his salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he was given the run-around under
the pretext of waiting for a new assignment.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on 4 December 1987 petitioner filed a complaint with the
NLRC, National Capital Region, against PNCC for <u><span style="">separation</span></u><span style=""> <u>pay</u>
<u>and/or</u> <u>retirement</u> <u>benefits</u></span> (NLRC Case <span style="">No. </span>NCR-00-12-04256-87); after three
hearings, and following receipt of <span class="SpellE">PNCC's</span> position
paper which, among others, raised the issue of prescription, petitioner filed
on 23 February 1988 an amended complaint to include the charge of illegal
dismissal with a prayer for reinstatement with full back wages and without loss
of seniority rights and other benefits.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">PNCC also </span>raised
the issue of jurisdiction, maintaining that since petitioner is a contract
worker for overseas employment, it is the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) which has exclusive jurisdiction over the case pursuant
to Section 4(a) <span style="">of </span>Executive
Order <span style="">No. </span>797.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her decision of <span style="">22 </span>September
1988 Labor Arbiter Nieves V. de Castro decided the case in favor of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent PNCC appealed to
the NLRC alleging therein that the Labor Arbiter committed serious errors of
law and finding of facts by completely disregarding vital documents showing
that petitioner is an overseas project employee, thus the Commission has no
jurisdiction over the case, and that prescription had already set in with
respect to his claim for separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In its decision of 16 February <span style="">1989,
</span>the NLRC held that the appeal deserves merit not on jurisdictional
grounds but on prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> A
complaint for illegal dismissal being a violation of one's right prescribes in
four (4) years from the time of its accrual.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Art. 292 of the Labor Code does not apply in the instant case but Art.
1146 of the Civil Code which supplied (sic) the Labor Code's deficiency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court ruled that an action for damages involving a
plaintiff separated from his employment for alleged unjustifiable causes is one
for ‘injury to the rights of the plaintiff, and must be brought within four (4)
years’ (Valencia vs. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Portland, 106 Phil.
732).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four (4) years prescriptive
period under Art. 1146 of the New Civil Code, applies by way of supplement in
the instant case - being an injury to the rights of the plaintiff - (<span class="SpellE">Collanta</span> vs. Carnation Phil. Inc., G.R. No. 70615, Oct. 28,
1986).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The period of prescription mentioned under Art. 292 of the Labor
Code refers to and is limited to money claims, all other cases of injury to
rights of a working man being governed by the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the plaintiff (complainant) had
four (4) years within which to file his complaint for the injury to his right
as provided under Art. 1146 of the Civil Code (Santos vs. CA, 96 SCRA 448
(1980))."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the complaint of petitioner was filed on 4
December 1987, or more than four (4) years from the accrual of the cause of
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the <span style="">issue </span>of
jurisdiction, NLRC ruled that Section 4(a) of Executive Order No. 797 does not
apply to a regular employee (like petitioner) of a local establishment or a
Philippine registered company on foreign assignment notwithstanding the
execution of an overseas employment contract and the verification of such
contract by the POEA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor
Arbiter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner submits that respondent NLRC acted with grave abuse of
discretion and that its decision "runs counter to the findings of facts
and evidence” and argues that prescription has not set in with respect to his
claim because there was no formal termination of his employment issued by PNCC;
he was "merely being floated" or "given the run around under the
pretext of waiting for a new assignment." He further argues that the
statute of limitations has been devised to operate primarily against those who
sleep on their rights and not against those who desire to act but cannot do so
for causes beyond their control.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Insofar as he is concerned, much as he wanted to institute his claim, he
"was prevented to do so beyond his control for the simple reason that
private respondent have (sic) tried to circumvent the law by merely
floating" him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Comment, PNCC asserts that NLRC is correct in holding that
petitioner is barred by prescription; moreover, it alleges that he is a project
employee, thus not entitled to separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Comment, NLRC maintains the correctness of the questioned
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the claim of
petitioner that formal notice of termination is necessary before the period of
prescription could commence to run, it argues that absence of notice does not
mean that petitioner's employment was not terminated by respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his return from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>
in January 1983 he was neither given any work assignment nor paid his
salary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A clear intention was thus
manifested to dispense with his services which, from the import of these
circumstances, petitioner could not have failed to comprehend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should not have waited for December 1987
to file his complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is not <span style="">impressed
</span>with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">There <span style="">is </span>no showing
whatsoever that respondent NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in
reversing the decision of the Labor Arbiter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It<span style=""> </span>correctly ruled that
petitioner's cause of action had already prescribed when he filed his complaint
with the regional office of the NLRC on 4 December 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His cause of action accrued immediately after
his arrival from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> in January 1983 when, as he
claimed, he was not given any assignment nor paid his salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his original complaint, petitioner merely asked for payment of
separation pay and/or retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
amended complaint, petitioner's cause of action is founded on <u><span style="">illegal</span></u><span style=""> <u>dismissal</u> </span>and prayed for reinstatement with full back
wages and without loss of seniority rights and other benefits, or, in the
alternative, the payment of his separation benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>the basis then
of his amended complaint, the action is <span style="">not
</span>for an ordinary money claim but for reinstatement by reason of <u><span style="">illegal</span></u><span style=""> <u>dismissal</u>, </span>which, undoubtedly, is an injury to his
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the action should
have been brought within four (4) years from its occurrence pursuant to Article
1146 of the Civil Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Had petitioner stuck to his original complaint, which was a
simple money claim for separation pay, Article 292 (now 291) of the Labor Code
which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>All money claims arising from
employer-employee relations accruing during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Code shall be filed within three <span style="">(3)
</span>years from the time the cause of action accrued; otherwise, they shall
be forever barred."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">would have, nevertheless, successfully
blocked his claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">While We commiserate with petitioner who found himself jobless
upon his return and while We fully recognize the special protection which the
Constitution, labor laws, and social legislation accord the workingman, We
cannot, however, alter amend the law on prescription to relieve him of the
consequences of his inaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><i style=""><u>Vigilantibus</u></i></span><i style=""><u>,</u> </i><i style=""><u><span style="">non </span><span class="SpellE">dormientibus</span>,</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jura</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>subveniunt</u></span></i> (Laws come to the assistance of the
vigilant, not of the sleeping).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
explanation that he could not have filed the complaint earlier because “he was
prevented to do so beyond his control for the simple reason that private
respondent have (sic) tried to circumvent the law by merely floating" him
is very flimsy and does not even evoke sympathetic consideration, if at all it
is proper and necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note that
petitioner herein is not an unlettered man; he seems to be educated and
assertive of his rights and appears to be familiar with judicial procedures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He filed a motion for extension of time to
file the petition and the petition itself without the assistance of
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot believe that if
indeed he had a valid grievance against PNCC he would not have taken immediate
positive steps for its redress.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for lack
of merit, the Petition <span style="">is </span><span style="">DISMISSED </span>without pronouncements as to
costs.</p>
