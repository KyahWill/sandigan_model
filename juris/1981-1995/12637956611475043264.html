<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the victim, Dr. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, met his death when he was gunned down in the 
afternoon of <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="11">November <span>19,

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version of the facts surrounding the killing, 
based in the main on testimony elicited from <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Sartorio</span>, Jose Vera, <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Selleza</span> (or <span class="SpellE">Silleza</span>) Denis <span class="SpellE">Cernal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermites</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, is as

<p class="BODY">In the local elections of 1967, a rift or feud had developed 
between the deceased, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> <span class="SpellE">Traya</span>, when the former had 
run for vice-mayor and the latter for mayor, of <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Though both belonged to the

<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> as vice-mayoralty candidate, obtained 500 votes

<p class="BODY">In the morning of <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1969</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Sartorio</span> was at the house of <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> <span class="SpellE">Traya</span> in <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span> to remind the latter about his promise to answer for 
the expenses that <span class="SpellE">Sartorio</span> had incurred for the 
treatment of an injury by an errand boy of <span class="SpellE">Traya</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>While waiting, <span class="SpellE">Sartorio</span> heard <span class="SpellE">Traya</span>, as the 
latter was going down the stairs, tell his son, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>, to take "Winnie" and "<span class="SpellE">Titoy</span>" and kill the <span class="SpellE">Alveros</span>, 
starting with "<span class="SpellE">Pedring</span>".<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> thereupon went upstairs and returned shortly, with 
a carbine and two Thompson submachine guns.<span>&nbsp; </span>He handed the carbine 
to Winnie <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span> and one of the submachine guns to 
<span class="SpellE">Titoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span>, keeping the 
other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>

whose sister was the wife of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, a brother 
of Dr. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, where Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> was, and when Vera professed ignorance of the 
doctor's whereabouts, pistol-whipped him, hitting him in the nape of the 
neck.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, while he and his men trained their guns on Vera, <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> told him, "You tell the Doctor that if I see him I 
am going to kill him, if I will not be able to personally kill him, my boys will 
kill him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>

for Congressman Mate in the house of <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Selleza</span> in the <span class="SpellE">Bantay</span> District of 
<span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Traya</span> arrived near the

shout, "<span class="SpellE"><em>Palusara</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>ngadi</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>si</em></span><em> 
Vice Mayor</em>." (Let the Vice Mayor come down here.") After some whispered 
conferences with other persons at the party, Congressman Mate went down to where 
the <span class="SpellE">Trayas</span> were and returned in a few minutes.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Sometime later, shots were heard from the direction of where the <span class="SpellE">Trayas</span> were.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some commotion ensued inside the 
<span class="SpellE">Selleza</span> residence, and one lady "collapsed", but the 
party went on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Two days afterwards, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30</st1:time> in the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Traya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Titoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> and Winnie <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span> walked 
into the billiard hall in <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span> owned by Dr. Pedro 
<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, who was then seated at one of the tables 
watching the billiard and mahjong games in progress.<span>&nbsp; </span>All three 
were armed, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> with submachine guns and <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span> with a carbine.<span>&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span> posted himself near the entrance, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> separated and 
went toward Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> approaching from the right and <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> from the left.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nearing Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> his gun at him, and <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> was only able to utter the word "<em>Pare</em>", 
before <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> opened fire, causing <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> to jump from his seat and crouch down on the floor, 
clutching the edge of the billiard table.<span>&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> was in that position, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> fired at him 
several times until he slumped to the floor.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> tried to crawl toward the wall, but <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>, having in the meantime exchanged weapons with 
<span class="SpellE">Verterra</span>, shot him in the right backside with <span class="SpellE">Verterra's</span> carbine.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> collapsed on the floor, face down.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Titoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Cinco</span> then 
approached and fired at him.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Verterra</span>

informed that there already was a "quorum" (a full complement of players) at the 
billiard hall, heard the sound of gunfire and saw people running from the 
hall.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of them told him that his brother had been killed by 
<span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Traya</span> and his 
companions.<span>&nbsp; </span>He ran toward the billiard hall and upon hearing the 
entrance, he saw <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Traya</span> with a gun pointed at the dead body of his

remained in hiding for two days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The body of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> was taken to his 
mother's house in <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span> where an autopsy was 
performed by the municipal health officer, Dr. Lorenzo S. <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span> later testified that four of the multiple wounds 
sustained by the deceased were fatal wounds, two of which would have caused 
death instantaneously.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Traya</span>, for his part, asserted his innocence of the killing 
which he ascribed to Winnie <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
declared that he had gone to the billiard hall, alone and unarmed, to play 
billiards; that among the persons he saw inside the place were Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> and <span>Winnie </span><span class="SpellE">Verterra</span>; that when Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> saw 
him, he (<span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>) said angrily, "Good that you are 
already here," lunged at him and grappled with him; that he succeeded in pushing 
the doctor away, and the latter lost his balance and fell to the floor on his 
back; that he (appellant) then made for the door, but stumbled over a billiard 
table, at which moment he heard gunshots and looked back to see Winnie <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span>, pistol in hand, and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> down on the floor, breathing hard; that as he ran for 
the door again, he heard more gunshots, this time from outside the hall and, 
looking back once more, saw Winnie <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span> bent over 
and about to fall as if he had been hit; and that <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span> managed to leave the hall with him (appellant), but 
he was limping and his shoes were stained with blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">In a statement given to a military investigator and sworn to 
before the provincial fiscal on April 28, 1970 (before the information was 
filed), Winnie <span class="SpellE">Verterra</span> substantially confirmed the 
prosecution's version — already recounted — of the events that occurred in the 
evening of November 17, 1969 as well as of the actual killing of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> two days later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> At the trial, however, and on the witness 
stand, he sought to repudiate said statement, saying that he subscribed and 
swore to the same only because he had been assured by the fiscal that no harm 
would come to him if he did so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He 
testified in support of the appellant's version of the incident and admitted 
that he had fired several shots at Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> who, he 
claimed, had at that moment been rising from the floor, where he had fallen 
after a scuffle with the appellant, and aiming his pistol at the latter.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He also stated that as he was running for the door afterwards, he had 
been fired at by <span class="SpellE">Hermites</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> and had been hit in the right thigh and left 
knee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Also presented by the defense to corroborate wholly or in part the 
appellant's version of the killing were Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Anatolio</span> <span class="SpellE">Loreno</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> <span class="SpellE">Anadia</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">In his appeal to the Court of Appeals, the appellant assailed the 
Trial Court's decision convicting him as vitiated by threefold error which 
consisted in:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) finding that the <span class="SpellE">Traya</span> 
family had evil designs (motive) against the deceased; (b) according full faith 
and credit to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> and Denis <span class="SpellE">Cernal</span>, the 
prosecution's principal witnesses to the actual killing; and (c) (in 
consequence) convicting him (appellant).</p>
<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found no merit in those submissions, 
adverting to the well-established rule that in matters involving the credibility 
of witnesses, the findings of trial courts, which are better situated to resolve 
the same, having heard the witnesses testify and observed at first-hand their 
deportment on the stand and manner of testifying, will not ordinarily be 
disturbed on appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">This Court finds no reason to disagree, not only because it is 
equally well settled that the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals — and 
said Court's determination of the appellant's guilt is a finding of fact or a 
conclusion based upon findings of fact — are conclusive upon the parties as well 
as this Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> subject only to 
recognized exceptions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> none of which 
obtains here, but also because a thorough review of the record shows that the 
Trial Court appraised the evidence meticulously and eminently well and in 
reaching a conclusion of guilt against the appellant did not overlook or <span class="SpellE">misappreciate</span> any fact or circumstance of weight.</p>
<p class="BODY">Motive, rooted in bad blood that arose between <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> <span class="SpellE">Traya</span>, the appellant's 
father, and the deceased following the elections of <span>1967, </span>was 
sufficiently established by testimony which, as far as the record shows, was not 
disputed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The actions of the <span class="SpellE">Trayas</span>, 
father and son, and their men two days before the deceased was killed evidencing 
a resolute purpose to do him in are attested by witnesses whose veracity the 
Trial Court saw no reason to doubt.<span>&nbsp; </span>At any rate, motive becomes 
relevant, and its absence may assume determinative significance, only when the 
accused has not been positively identified,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> and proof thereof becomes essential only 
when evidence of commission of the crime is purely circumstantial or is 
inconclusive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> This Court has time and 
again ruled that lack of motive does not preclude conviction when the crime and 
the participation of the accused therein are definitely established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The imputation of bias to the two eyewitnesses, <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> and Denis <span class="SpellE">Cernal</span>, the latter a ten-year old boy, because they 
allegedly lived with and were supported by the <span class="SpellE">Alveros</span>, and the allusion of certain defects in their 
testimony fail to overcome the belief that is induced by their substantially 
cohesive and mutually corroborative declarations as to how Dr. <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> met his death and at whose hands.<span>&nbsp; </span>While 
the Trial Court expressed some reservations about the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span>, mainly because he 
admitted to having been convicted of qualified theft and served a one-year jail 
term,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> it seemed to have none about 
that of Denis <span class="SpellE">Cernal</span>, whom it found to have testified 
"*** with firm directness and disarming candor ***" and to have had" *** the 
steadfast courage to remain, in the midst of firing from high <span class="SpellE">calibered</span> guns, so as to stamp indelibly in his mind and 
memory the details of the criminal conduct of the three accused."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> If the Trial Court was persuaded to 
accept the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alvero</span> because of its congruence with that of <span class="SpellE">Cernal</span> or, as more appropriately appears, because its truth 
is confirmed by the totality of the other evidence for the prosecution, that, 
surely, was not error.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the appellant's conviction could 
stand even without <span class="SpellE">Alvero's</span> testimony and on that of 
<span class="SpellE">Cernal</span> alone, it having been held that the testimony 
of a single witness, when credible, is sufficient to convict.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the crime committed by 
the appellant was murder, not homicide, the same being attended by the 
qualifying circumstance of treachery.<span>&nbsp; </span>The civil indemnity imposed 
should, however, be raised to P30,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> </p>
