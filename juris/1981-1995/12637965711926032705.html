				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">From an adverse decision of the former Intermediate Appellate
Court which affirmed the order of the Regional Trial Court, the petitioners
come to us in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only issue in the petition is whether or
not the court should approve a notice of appeal which was filed out of time due
to a fortuitous event.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the appellate court are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In a complaint for sum of money filed before the Regional
Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Branch CXX, judgment was
rendered in favor of private respondent Ernesto R. Cruz, doing business under
the name and style of "EMD Trading Center", ordering defendant Municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, to pay
the plaintiff P71,147.15, representing the value of unpaid merchandise it
purchased <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">from </span>him with interest
at the legal rate from the filing of the complaint; P20,000.00 by way of moral
damages; P10,000.00 by way of exemplary damages; P10,000.00 as and for
attorney's fees; and costs of suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner municipality, defendant in the court below,
admitted that it received copy of the decision on June 13, 1985 (not June 30,
1985 as erroneously typewritten) and that the period to file an appeal would
expire on June 28, 1985 (par. 5, petition).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No motion for reconsideration of the decision was filed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is contended that petitioners had prepared its Notice of
Appeal on <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1985</st1:date> and
were ready to file the same by registered mail on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1985</st1:date>, but because of a strong typhoon, "<span class="SpellE">Daling</span>", on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="6">June
 28, 1985</st1:date>, public offices throughout <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
and most parts of Metro Manila and <st1:place>Central Luzon</st1:place> were
closed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was further alleged that
strong winds and heavy rains including flood waters prevailed on June 28, 29,
and 30, 1985 which prevented the filing of a notice of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed the notice of appeal by
registered mail on <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1985</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On motion of private respondent, the court, in an order dated
<st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1985</st1:date> dismissed the
appeal for being untimely filed and granted the motion for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">execution." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, </span>pp. 14-15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the petitioners went to the Intermediate Appellate
Court on petition for <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1985</st1:date>,
the appellate court dismissed the petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It ruled that an "[A]<span class="SpellE">ppeal</span> is a purely
statutory remedy" a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">n</span>d<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>its perfection within the period
provided by law "is not only mandatory but jurisdictional." Citing
the pronouncement of this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Habaluyas</u></span><u>
Enterprises, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Japzon</span></u>,
(G.R. No. 70895, August 5, 1985, 138 SCRA 46), it held that "the
fifteen-day period for appeal or for filing a motion for reconsideration cannot
be extended," and the "[F]<span class="SpellE">ailure</span> to comply
has the effect of rendering the questioned judgment final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petition now before
us assails the lower courts' rulings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
alleges that the intervention of a strong and devastating typhoon, which is
"an act of God or an act of nature," should excuse the petitioners' failure
to file the notice of appeal on time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petition further cites cases, i.e. <u>Ernesto v. Court of Appeals</u>
(131 SCRA 347) and <u>Director of Lands v. <span class="SpellE">Romamban</span></u>
(131 SCRA 431), presenting the liberal view of this Court regarding appeals
filed out of time but which are impressed with merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners aver that a review of the
trial court's decision is warranted because the respondent admitted in
paragraph 15 of his complaint that his transaction with the petitioners did not
adhere to the prescribed legal procedure in PD 1445, otherwise known as the
Government Auditing Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Judiciary
Reorganization Act, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, was designed to avoid the procedural delays that
plagued the administration of justice under the existing rules which were
originally intended to assist the parties in obtaining </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">just, </span>speedy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
inexpensive administration of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That is why (with some exceptions) the record on appeal was dispensed
with and the thirty-day period was reduced to fifteen days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only a notice of appeal is required and a
record on appeal is no longer necessary except in appeals in special
proceedings under Rule 109 of the Rules of Court and in other cases wherein
multiple appeals </span>are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">allowed (<span class="SpellE">Habaluyas</span> Enterprises, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Japzon</span>,
Resolution, 142 SCRA 208).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the
subsequent case of </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Lacsamana</u></span><u> v.</u></span><u>
Second Special Cases Division </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
</span>the Intermediate Appellate Court</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(143 SCRA 643, 648), this Court, clarifying the new procedure in filing
appeals and petitions for review; held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>ORDINARY</span> APPEALS BY MERE NOTICE OF
APPEAL.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In an ordinary appeal from the final judgment or order of a
metropolitan or municipal trial court to the regional trial court, and from the
regional trial court to the Court of Appeals in actions or proceedings
originally filed in the regional trial court, the <u>fifteen-day period for
appeal</u> provided by Section 39 of BP No. 129 and Section 19(a) of the
Interim Rules is interrupted or suspended by a motion for new trial or
reconsideration, unless such motion fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule
37 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(Section 3 of Rule 41).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the motion for new trial or
reconsideration is denied, the moving party has only the remaining period from
notice of denial within which to file </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">notice of appeal, which is the only requirement for taking an appeal
under the present rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, </span><u>no
extension of time to file </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">such a
notice of appeal is needed, much </span>less allowed."<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is clear that in
ordinary appeals, the fifteen-day period to appeal may not be extended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Such an extension is unnecessary
because under the new rule, only a notice of appeal is required and the time
consuming submission of the record on appeal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">has </span>been discarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case we find no compelling reason to depart from the
prescribed rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, we
find negligence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>the part of
the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot understand
why, when no motion for reconsideration had been filed, the petitioners should
wait until the last day for filing a mere notice of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing difficult, time-consuming,
or perplexing in filing a notice of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners' <span class="GramE">counsel were</span> familiar with every
aspect and detail of their case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming that they had been prevented from doing so by a
strong typhoon which lasted for several days, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">we </span>note that their last day for filing the notice, which was <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1985</st1:date> fell on a Friday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They could, therefore, have filed the same on
the next working day, which was on <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners,
however, filed the notice on <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="7">July 3,
 1985</st1:date> with the lame excuse that the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office was in a mess brought about by the typhoon so that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">failure </span>to file the same was not
discovered at once.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not the
typhoon which caused the delay in filing the notice of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the dilly-dallying, negligence, and
lack of attention of the petitioners' counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is
DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assailed decision of the
Court of Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
