of the Deputy Minister, Ministry of Labor and Employment, which directed the
reinstatement with backwages of private respondent Saturnino Atentar, is
challenged in this petition as having been issued with grave abuse of
discretion tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Saturnino Atentar started
working for International Hardwood and Veneer Company of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> (Interwood) on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">March 23, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> as a road construction laborer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="17" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">March 17, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, he was promoted to motor banca helper
assigned to operate motor bancas at the Interwood log pond in Barrio Sabang,
Mauban, Quezon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also given
confidential assignments to assist a team of company security personnel and
Philippine constabulary soldiers patrolling the area to curb the smuggling of
illegally cut logs from the petitioner's forest con­cessions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1977, the petitioner applied for clearance to
terminate the services of Mr. Atentar (with two other employees) for serious
offenses and violation of company rules and regulations including (a) the use
of company property for personal use <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and
gain without authority; (b) dishonesty; (c) serious misconduct; and (d) fraud
and wilfull breach of trust.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1979</st1:date>,
the Regional Director of the Ministry of Labor and Employment issued an order,
the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing, respondent is
hereby ordered to reinstate complainant immediately with full backwages from <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1978</st1:date> when the complaint was
filed up to actual date of reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the application for clearance for his termination is
hereby <span class="GramE">Denied</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As regards the other charges particularly non-payment of 13th month pay
and accrued sick leaves, the records showed that the company is exempt from
complying with PD 851 only for 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is therefore liable for the years 1975 and 1976, hence, it is hereby ordered to
pay the 13th month pay of complainant for these years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the claim for accrued
vacation leave is hereby dismissed it having been shown that the same has
already been paid."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Acting on an appeal filed
by Interwood, the Deputy Minister of labor issued on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">June 11,
 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the order now
challenged in this petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The disposi­tive
portion reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Order of this Office dated <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="2">27 February 1981</st1:date> is hereby affirmed
subject to the modi­fication that the respondent is de­clared exempted from
paying the complainant of the 13th month pay for 1975 and 1976."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The grounds for the
petitioner's application for clearance are summarized in the order of the
Regional Director as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The records show that <span class="GramE">applicant company</span>
anchored the charge of using company property for personal use on the
statements of Roden Laureles, a former security guard until June 1977, to the
effect that he had seen complainant herein using the company boat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no declaration by said affiant
however, whether he has knowledge of whether complainant did not secure a prior
permission and authority, when the latter used the boat or whether the purpose
for which it was used was personal in nature or for the benefit of the
company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are the more significant
questions that have not been clarified by the respondent company in throwing
the accusations against complainant herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"On the charge of
dishonesty, </span>the respondent alleged that complainant herein was
apprehended while in the act of towing a piece of log from its log pond to
Mauban Insular Sawmill, which is in violation of the company's rules and
regulations on theft or appropriation of company property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of this accusation, the company
submitted the affidavit of Reynaldo Manuba dated <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1978</st1:date>, another banca operator of the company.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"And for the last two
grounds which are serious misconduct and fraud or wilfull breach of trust
apparently, the company has as its basis the participation and collusion by
complainant herein and Oscar Joven, a log scaler in doubly scaling logs thereby
doubly charging the company and sharing the proceeds therefrom between
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, the charge
of serious misconduct, breach of trust and fraud which infrac­tions were also
touched by Manuba and Laureles in their declarations."</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">This petition may be
resolved on the issue of dishonesty alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Atentar was a motor banca
operator assigned to the Mauban log pond of Interwood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was given, in addition to his regular
duties, the confidential assignment of helping an anti-smuggling team of
security personnel patrol the environs of the company log pond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atentar was caught in the very act he was
supposed to curb or guard against.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Security personnel apprehended Atentar while he was towing a pilfered
log from the Interwood log pond to the Mauban Insular Sawmill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There is no question that
the theft of logs by an employee who operates the motor bancas used in towing
those logs and who is given the extra assignment of helping security personnel
patrol the waters in and around the log pond against log thieves is valid
reason for dismissal by his employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The act of pilferage violated both Article 283 of the Labor Code and the
employer's company rules and regulations, which provide:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"'ART.</span> 283 - Termination by employer
- An employer may terminate an employment without a definite period for any of
the following just causes:</blockquote>

use any company property, material, record or equipment without written
permission or consent of the proper authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Violation of this rule will subject the guilty party to immediate
dismissal and criminal prosecution.'"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is an established
principle that an employer cannot be compelled to continue in employment an employee

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The respondents argue
that Interwood failed to submit the required quantum of evidence to support </span>its
application for clearance to terminate the private respondent's
employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents' principal
contention is that this Court's corrective powers do not go so far as to
evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the Deputy Minister and the
Region­al Director based their determinations but are limited to issues of
jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

jurisdiction </span>is confined to specific matters are <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">generally</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> </span>accorded not only respect but even finality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is especially true of determinations
made by the Ministry of Labor and Employment which implements not only statutory
functions and duties but the constitutional mandate to the State to afford
protection to labor, promote full employment and equality in employment, ensure
equal work opportunities regardless of sex, race, or creed, and regulate the
relations between workers and employers and to assure the rights of workers to
self-organization, collective bargaining, security of tenure, and just and
humane conditions of work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Article II,
Section 9, Constitution).</p>

<p class="BODY">Our respect for the findings and conclusions of the Ministry of
Labor and Employment and our according them a measure of finality are, however,
subject to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">well-known exceptions which
we reiterate because of the number of adjudications of the labor ministry and
labor tribunals elevated to us for review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where there has been a failure to correctly interpret and apply the
provisions of law applicable to the facts of a particular case or where factual
findings are not supported by substantial evidence, or where there is grave
abuse of discretion or want or excess of jurisdiction, we assert our power to
review and set aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

affidavits of security guard Roden Laureles and banca operator Reynaldo Manuba

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of a dishonest employee is as much in the interests
of labor as it is of management.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
labor force in any company is protected and the workers' security of tenure
strengthened when pilferage of equipment, goods, and products which endangers
the viability of an employer and, therefore, the workers' continued employment
is minimized or eliminated and consequently labor-management relations based on
mutual trust and confidence are promoted.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are other issues raised in this petition including the
alleged abolition of jobs at the Mauban, Quezon operations of Interwood because
of President Marcos' orders to stop logging operations in the area but there is
no need to pass upon them.</p>
