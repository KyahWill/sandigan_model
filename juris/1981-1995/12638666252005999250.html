 1960</st1:date>, Republic Act No. 3001 was passed granting petitioner the

stations all over the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Through
said broadcasting stations, petitioner was able to provide adequate public
service which enabled the government to reach the population on important
public <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">issues, </span>and assist the
government in programs relating to public information and education.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its radio stations have never been used for
the broadcasting of obscene or indecent language or speech, or for the
dissemination of misleading information or willful misrepresentation, or to the
detriment of the public health, or to incite, encourage or assist in subversion
or treasonable acts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 10 of Republic Act No. 3001, petitioner's franchise
or permit "shall be subject to amendment, alteration or repeal by the

<p class="BODY">Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the said Decree provide as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No person or
corporation may own, operate, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>manage
more than one radio or television station in one municipality or city; nor more
than five AM and FM radio stations; nor more than five television channels in
the entire <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">country, </span>and no radio
or television station shall be utilized by any single-interest group to
disseminate information or otherwise influence the public or the government to
serve or support the ends of such group.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">person or </span>corporation which owns <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">more </span>than the number of radio or
television stations authorized in the preceding section shall divest itself of
the excess stations or channels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any
excess station shall be sold through the Board of Communications.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The divestiture provided herein shall be made not later than <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, a person or corporation shall
make such divestiture within one year from the discovery of the offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure to divest as
provided in the foregoing section shall, in addition to the penalties provided
in Section 6, subject the person or corporation guilty of such failure to
cancellation of the franchise of every excess station and to confiscation of
the station and its facilities without compensation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All franchises,
grants, licenses, permits, certificates or other forms of authority to operate
radio or television broadcasting systems shall terminate on <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, irrespective of any franchise,
grant, license, permit, certificate or other forms of authority to operate
granted by any office, agency or person, no radio or television station shall
be authorized to operate without the authority of the Board of Communications
and the Secretary of Public Works and Communications or their successors who
have the right and authority to assign to qualified parties frequencies,
channels or other means of identifying broadcast systems; Provided, however,
that any conflict over, or disagreement with, a decision of the aforementioned
authorities may be appealed finally to the Office of the President within
fifteen days from the date the decision is received by the party in
interest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Section 6 of the said Decree, all franchises, grants,
licenses, permits, certificates, or other forms of authority to operate radio
or television <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">broadcasting
systems/stations, including the franchise or permit of petitioner under
Republic Act No. 3001, have been deemed terminated or revoked effective
December 31, </span>1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioner is left with only 3 radio stations located in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleged that said Decree has caused it great and
irreparable damage, because - (a) it divested petitioner of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>its franchise without due process of
law and forced it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">to </span>divest
itself of some of its radio stations; (b) it deprived petitioner of its right
to further construct, maintain and operate radio broadcasting stations in other
cities or municipalities of the country;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(c) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">it deprived petitioner of its right

institution in order to expand and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">continue
the operation of its radio broadcasting business; and (d) petitioner suffered
loss of income.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition to declare Presidential Decree No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">576-A as unconstitutional </span>and null and

ISSUANCE OF PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 576-A SUMMARILY TERMINATING THE

PETITIONER WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND/OR PAYMENT OF JUST COMPENSATION;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Without giving due<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>course
to the petition, the respondents were required to submit their comment thereto
within ten (10) days from notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
the comment of the respondents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>submitted,
the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">was </span>required to

<p class="BODY">After a careful deliberation on the petition, the Court finds the
same to be devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition seeks a declaration of the unconstitutionality
and/or nullity of Presidential Decree <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">No.
576-A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

relief under Rule 64 of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Rules
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such an action should be brought before the
Regional Trial Court and not before the Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A petition for declaratory relief is not among
the petitions within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court even if
only questions of </span>law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">are
involved.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the present petition should be dismissed on this score.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is no actual case or controversy involving the law
sought to be annulled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner does
not allege that it has filed an application for a license to operate a radio or
television station in excess of the authorized number and that the same is
being denied or refused on the basis of the restrictions under Presidential
Decree No. 576-A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner does not
also allege that it had been penalized or is being penalized for a violation
under said Decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, likewise,
no allegation that any of the petitioner's stations had been confiscated or
shut down pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 576-A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the constitutional challenge is
not being raised in the context of a specific case or controversy wherein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the petitioner has asserted his rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All that petitioner seeks </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the nullification of Presidential Decree No.
576-A and the reinstatement of its rights under Republic Act No. 3001.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Judicial review cannot be exercised <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vacuo</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judicial power is "the right to

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleges that it used to maintain and operate at least
ten (10) radio broadcasting stations but pursuant to Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of
Presidential Decree No. 576-A it divested itself of the "excess
stations" thus leaving it with three (3) radio stations located in Iloilo
City, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner did <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">not </span>allege that it challenged the
constitutionality of the decree at any time since it took effect on <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">It </span>does
not appear that petitioner's compliance was made under protest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of its acquiescence with Presidential
Decree No. 576-A, the petitioner is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from
challenging the same under the principle of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
that "one who sleeps on his rights shall not be heard to complain."</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation of petitioner that its petition should be treated
as a petition for prohibition does not place petitioner in any better
position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition cannot be
considered as one for prohibition as it does not seek to prohibit further
proceedings being conducted by any tribunal, corporation, board or person
exercising judicial or ministerial functions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petition, petitioner does not seek to prohibit any
proceeding being conducted by public respondent which adversely affects its
interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner does not claim that
it has a pending application for a broadcast license which is about to be
denied under Presidential Decree No. 576-A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, what petitioner seeks <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to
p</span>rohibit is the possible denial of an application <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">it may make </span>to operate radio or television
stations on the basis of the restrictions imposed by Presidential Decree <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">No. </span>576-A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the petition is premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner prays for reinstatement of its rights under its
original franchise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reinstatement is an
affirmative remedy and cannot be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">secured
</span>through a writ of prohibition which is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">essentially </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>preventive
and not a corrective remedy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot
