plead for reversal of the decision dated November 10, 1988 of the National
Labor Relations Commission in NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-05-01858-87, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span> H. <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> vs. PNCC-<span class="SpellE">Tollways</span> Division and/or Eduardo B. <span class="SpellE">Olaguer</span>-President
and Cesar D. <span class="SpellE">Templo</span>, Head-<span class="SpellE">Tollways</span>
Division," for grave abuse of discretion in holding that the dismissal on
June 25, 1987, of the private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>, from his position as manager/head of the
petitioner's Operation and Maintenance of Electronics Equipments and
Communication Systems (OMEECS) of the <span class="SpellE">Tollways</span>
Division, South Luzon Expressway was illegal and in ordering the petitioner
Philippine National Construction Corporation (or PNCC) to pay him <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">separation
pay in lieu of reinstatement, plus attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> decision reads as follows:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is partially AFFIRMED
with respect to the findings of the Labor Arbiter <span class="GramE">that
complainant was deprived of due process in the manner of his dismissal from the
service and hereby declare</span> that respondent was guilty of illegal
dismissal of complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The award for
separation benefits in favor of complainant is also upheld in lieu of the
latter's reinstatement, with the modification by ordering and directing
respondents to pay complainant separation pay equivalent to one (1) month pay
based on his latest salary for every year of service to respondent company, and
to pay complainant <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> effective June 15, 1987
up to the date of the promulgation of this judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent is further assessed payment of
attorney's fees fixed at five (5%) percent of the money award.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter found that <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>
was dismissed<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>without due process

terminating his services effective <st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="6">June
 25, 1987</st1:date>, without giving him an opportunity to defend <span class="GramE">himself</span> in an appropriate investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also found that "respondents failed
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">establish the charge of
overstocking," (p. 101, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) but, based on the
affidavit of another employee, Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, the
Labor Arbiter opined that PNCC had reason to dismiss <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>
for misconduct when the company's radio licenses were not renewed despite the
cash advance of P5,460 that <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> obtained for
that purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by PNCC, the NLRC set aside the Labor Arbiter's finding
that there was lawful cause for <span class="SpellE">Macasaet's</span>
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC noted that "in
ruling on the alleged misconduct of herein complainant (<span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>),
the Labor Arbiter greatly relied on the sworn statement of Jose <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Baltazar</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the subordinate supervisor of complainant,
which the Arbiter admitted and considered without affording herein complainant
the opportunity to refute or offer any rebuttal evidence." The NLRC
observed that "this Act of the Arbiter amounted to grave abuse of
discretion and denial of herein complainant of his right to procedural due
process (</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

144, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span> The NLRC ruled that since the
manner of dismissing the employee was "oppressive and contrary to
law," (p. 143, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) the dismissal was illegal
"even if the employer may have had some justifiable grounds to dismiss the
employee." </span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(<u>Ibid.</u>)</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It

<blockquote>"The twin requirements of notice and hearing constitute
essential elements of due process <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>cases
of employee dismissal; the requirement of notice is intended to inform the
employee concerned of the employer's intent to dismiss and the reason for the
proposed dismissal; upon the other hand, the requirement of hearing affords an
employee an opportunity to answer his employer's charges against him and
accordingly to defend himself <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> before
dismissal is effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither of these

<p class="BODY">The NLRC presumably considered <span class="SpellE">Macasaet's</span>
arguments in his appeal memorandum (which the petitioner did not refute)
showing that he was not to blame for the non-payment of the license fees on or
before the deadline on <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="11">November 30,
 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, to whom the P5,460 was given by <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>, failed to pay the license fees because, as
admitted in <span class="SpellE">PNCC's</span> position paper, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> was advised by <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span> of the National Telecommunications Commission (or
NTC) to apply for the extension of the licenses, which he did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That PNCC had to pay P19,634.02 (instead of
P5,460) was not due to any penalty charges (falsely alleged by PNCC) but due to
the fact (shown by its own receipts) that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) NTC charged P1,050 for the change of name of the corporation from
"CDCP" to "PNCC"; (2) increased the inspection fee from
P1,265 to P6,194.51; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>(3)
charged P12,389.51 for the extension of the license to cover the period of June
5, 1985 up to November 30, 1987 (p. 117, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The real reason for his dismissal, according to <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>, was <span class="SpellE">Olaguer's</span> desire to
overhaul the corporation as soon as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>was
installed as its new president after the EDSA revolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To make matters worse, <span class="SpellE">Olaguer</span>
was piqued when <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> and his immediate superior,
Andres Sebastian, then Vice-President of the <span class="SpellE">Tollways</span>
Division (until <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>was shortly
replaced by petitioner Cesar <span class="SpellE">Templo</span>), were lukewarm<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>toward <span class="SpellE">Olaguer's</span>
proposal to purchase new toll collection equipment and integrate expensive
weighing scales in the <span class="SpellE">tollways</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They suggested that the viability of those
proposed "improvements" and their impact on the fiscal condition of
the company be studied first.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It turned
out that <span class="SpellE">Olaguer</span> had already contacted a foreign
supplier of the equipment, GCH International, which sent representatives to the
meeting of the PNCC technical committee.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Olaguer</span> was further infuriated when his
interrogation of <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> failed to yield any damning
evidence of wrongdoing against Sebastian.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He called <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> names and demanded that he
resign.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>
did not comply, he was summarily dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC was convinced that the charge of dishonesty against <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> was not proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It observed that "there appears to be some doubt on the alleged
misconduct of complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
showing that he misappropriated the funds in his possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, his only fault, if at all, is
simple negligence that would not justify the harsh penalty of dismissal." <span class="GramE">(p. 145, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Mindful, however, of the strained relations between the parties,
the NLRC granted <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> separation pay of one month
for every year of service in lieu of reinstatement, plus <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
from the time of his dismissal on June 25, 1987 up to the date of its decision,
November 10, 1988.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its decision is not
tainted with grave abuse of discretion for it finds support in the decision of
this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Asiaworld</u></span><u> Publishing House,
Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span></u>, G.R. No. 56398, July 23, 1987, 152

in lieu of reinstatement.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
