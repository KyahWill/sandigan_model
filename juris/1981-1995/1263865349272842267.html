				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The only issue raised by the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in
this case is whether the respondent, <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer-Calleja</span>, Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations,
gravely abused her discretion in nullifying the resolution of the Board of
Administrators of the Allied Bank Employees Union which extended for one year
the term of office of the union officers which should have expired on February
10, 1987 and postponed to February 10, 1988 the holding of the election.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1984, the Allied Bank Employees Union (ABEU), which was then a
mere chapter of the National Union of Bank Employees (NUBE), elected its
officers, whose term of office would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">expire
</span>on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the expiration of the old CBA between the ABEU and Allied
Bank on <st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1984</st1:date>, the
ABEU negotiated for a new CBA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
because the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> and the Bank could not agree on major
economic proposals, a bargaining deadlock ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">ABEU filed a Notice of Strike on <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Labor Minister <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>
assumed jurisdiction over the labor dispute on <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In defiance of the Minister's return-to-work order, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
declared a strike on <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1985</st1:date>
and established <span class="SpellE">picketlines</span> at the Bank's Head Office
and <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span> Branch.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1985</st1:date>,
Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople</span> issued an Order resolving the deadlock
issues in the collective bargaining and in effect drew up a new CBA for the
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 3-year term of the new CBA
would expire on <st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> asked for
reconsideration, and on <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="2">February 11,
 1985</st1:date>, continued its strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two hundred seventy (270) striking officers and employees of ABEU (among
them were the private respondents) were dismissed by the Bank for abandonment
of work and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">commission </span>of
illegal acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="3">March <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">4, </span>1985</st1:date>, the Bank filed in

the Resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1985</st1:date>
modifying Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople's</span> order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1985</st1:date>, the ABEU on <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1985</st1:date> lifted its <span class="SpellE">picketlines</span> and announced its intention to return to
work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the Bank refused to admit
the strikers.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1985</st1:date>,
a referendum was conducted by the ABEU to ratify the 1985-1988 CBA
incorporating the additional benefits awarded in the <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1985</st1:date> resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A majority voted for ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1985</st1:date>,
the Bank filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>motion praying

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>general membership meeting for
the purpose of designating union representatives who would sign the CBA inasmuch

the Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1985</st1:date>,
the NUBE issued a special resolution creating an ABEU Interim Board tasked to

the referendum the matter of extending for one year the term of office of the
Interim Board, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>effect,
postponing for one year the election of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the

Franklin <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span> a letter-petition against the
postponement of the election of the officers of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1989</st1:date>,
the public respondent, Director <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> <span class="SpellE">Calleja</span> of the BLR, issued a resolution whose <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the election conducted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Allied Bank Employees Union on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">February 10, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> is hereby declared null and void.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another election is hereby ordered conducted in accordance
with the express tenor of the Med?Arbiter's Order dated <st1:date year="1988" day="4" month="1">4 January 1988</st1:date>, that a general
membership meeting shall first be held where the mechanics of the election
shall be fully threshed out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, the officers who were elected on <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="2">10 February 1988</st1:date> and whose election
to office we now declare null and void are hereby temporarily charged with the
safekeeping of the union funds subject to accounting before the new set of
officers which shall be elected in accordance with this Order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondent Bank is likewise enjoined to observe absolute neutrality
during these activities, they being purely an internal affair of the
union." (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> are as
follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the public
respondent erred in declaring null and void the election held on February 10,
1988; and</p>

<p class="NUM">b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
extension of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">CBA </span>was valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the petitioners' contention that the public
respondent gravely abused her discretion in annulling the <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1988</st1:date> election of officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The public respondent correctly noted that in
ordering the postponement of the election for one year (in effect extending
their term of office for one year), the ABEU Interim Board "overstepped
its bounds" for it was constituted and authorized only "to sign for
and in behalf of the union the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the Bank
and administer the CBA and the operation of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">union." </span>(p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">"</span>Instead of
calling a regular election of officers of ABEU on 11 February 1987, as mandated
by the Union's Constitution and by-laws, respondents submitted in a
'referendum' the extension of their term of office for yet another year, from
11 February 1987 to 10 February 1988.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the very inception the referendum process initiated by
the Interim Board was improper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
results <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> are therefore; invalid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be true, that the task of
administering the operation of the union was given to the ABEU-Interim Board at
the time it was constituted, to fill in the vacuum in the local union's leadership
during that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless said task
could not be exercised beyond the regular term of the regular officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stated simply, the exercise of said task is
only coterminous with the term of the regular officers, in whose shoes, the
members of the ABEU-Interim Board merely stepped into.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When the term of the union's regular officers expired on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1987</st1:date> the election of
officers should have been held, in accordance with the provision of the union
constitution and by laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the
expiration of the term of the regular officers, the term of the ABEU-Interim
Board, expired too.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In calling the
referendum therefore, the ABEU-Interim Board clearly overstepped its
bounds." (pp. 27­-28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second issue regarding the validity of the one-year extension
of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">CBA, </span>as observed by the
BLR has become moot and academic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
public respondent's view that the one-year extension was also null and void is
not quite correct for the extension was approved by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
in a referendum which was properly supervised by the Department of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was accepted by the Bank which gave a
"signing bonus" to the employees who voted for it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the holding of the referendum was
within the authority of the Interim Board "to administer the CBA and
operate the union," and the extension was acceptable to both of the
parties to the agreement, and did not violate any law, it is valid and binding
on them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
dismissed for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
