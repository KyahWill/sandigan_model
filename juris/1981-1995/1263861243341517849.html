<p class="BODY">The chief witnesses for the prosecution were the victim's two
sons, Arnold and Ariel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both of them
were with their father when the jeep he was driving was blocked by the killers
at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
in <st1:city><st1:place>Santa Cruz</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The brothers identified the
culprits as Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> who
first attacked Jaime, hitting him in the head with a hard object about <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>foot long and wrapped in a
newspaper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the victim fell off the
jeep as a result of the blow, Espinosa stabbed him repeatedly in the back with
a fan knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Floro</span>,
using an ice pick, stabbed Jaime several times in the chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jaime ran for his life but his attackers
pursued and continued stabbing him until the latter fell into a ditch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two assailants then walked away
fast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ariel boarded his dying father on
a tricycle and brought him to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Jose</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Reyes</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he expired from his wounds the next day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the brothers were corroborated by Manuel
Buenaventura, who said he saw the stabbing while he was on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>tricycle waiting to cross <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also identified Jaime's killers as the two
accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The necropsy report submitted by Dr. Luis <span class="SpellE">Larion</span>,
medico-legal officer of the Western Police District, (which was admitted by the
defense without his testimony) declared that Jaime <span class="SpellE">Mamucod</span>
died as a result of "profuse hemorrhage and shock due to multiple stab
wounds penetrating the chest and piercing the right lung and branches of the
right pulmonary artery and vein."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Another witness for the prosecution, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
Yang of the Western Police District, testified that it was he who investigated
the killing and took the statements of the victim's two sons implicating
Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense invoked alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Testifying for himself, <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> admitted that he
was at the basketball court earlier in the evening of <st1:date year="1981" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1981</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
</span>he was coaching one of the competing teams.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he left later because the games had been
called off and at the time of the stabbing he was in his house on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Almeda</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On cross examination, he declared that his
house was only about two hundred meters or two or three minutes walk from the
scene of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A prosecution witness,
Lilia Silva, was also asked to testify for the defense because she said she saw
Espinosa chasing and stabbing Jaime when the latter stumbled but made no
mention of <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When asked by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">defense counsel if
she saw <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> stabbing the victim, she said she did
not.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's brief faulted the trial court for accepting the
testimonies of the <span class="SpellE">Mamucod</span> brothers despite their
inconsistencies and contradictions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
defense stressed that whereas <st1:city><st1:place>Arnold</st1:place></st1:city>
said <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> hit Jaime in the nape of the neck, Ariel
said it was on the top of the head, and that while <st1:city><st1:place>Arnold</st1:place></st1:city>
said Jaime was stabbed while lying on the ground, Ariel said it was while his
father was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">standing. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">also unbelievable that after the stabbing Ariel should say, "<span class="SpellE">Tatay</span>, let us go home," when the natural thing to do
was to rush the dying man to the nearest hospital for immediate treatment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Noting that the necropsy report spoke only of stab wounds and not
punctured wounds, the defense also stressed that this proved the brothers were
lying when they swore that their father had been stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>
with an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ice </span>pick.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court has examined
the evidence of the parties and sees no reason for overturning the findings of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> A. de Leon, who had the opportunity to
observe the witnesses on the stand and assess their credibility by the various
indicia available to the trial court but not reflected in the record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The demeanor of the person on the stand can
draw the line between fact and fancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The forthright answer or the hesitant pause, the quivering voice or the
angry tone, the flustered look or the sincere gaze, the modest blush or the
guilty blanch - these can reveal if the witness is telling the truth or lying </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">his teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Absent then a showing
that the conclusions of the trial court are arbitrary or without basis, they
must be regarded with respect and accepted </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">conclusive on appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The discrepancies in the
declarations of Arnold and Ariel are not unnatural or evidence of perjury.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When their father was attacked, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Arnold</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> was seated at the front of the jeep beside
Jaime and Ariel was sitting behind them.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> The two brothers had therefore different
vantage points that gave each of them </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">separate view of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it should also be considered that the man being stabbed before
their very eyes was their father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
this traumatizing and shocking circumstance, the two sons, who were then only
sixteen and fifteen </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">respectively,
can </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hardly be expected to
remember the grisly stabbing in perfect detail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As for Lilia Silva, her
testimony is less than conclusive of <span class="SpellE">Floro's</span>
innocence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that she did
not see <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> at the scene of the crime does not
prove he was not there as she obviously was narrating only the latter part of
the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, she added that
there were many people around, which could be the reason she did not notice <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
her testimony cannot cancel the </span>sworn <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">declarations of Arnold and Ariel that they actually saw Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> killing Jaime <span class="SpellE">Mamucod</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The two sons could hardly have made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a mistake </span>regarding this matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the memory of these men is not easily blurred and must have been
indelibly imprinted in their young and impressionable minds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had no motive for falsely identifying
Espinosa and the accused?appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The only reason for naming them is the logical one:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>
were the men who killed their father.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the necropsy report did not mention any
punctured wounds must be rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span>phrase "stab wounds" is
used generically to include all wounds that may be caused "by weapons such
as knives, scissors, three-cornered files, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">ice </span>picks with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>circular
shaft, all possessing a sharp point but having blades of different
shapes".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Stabbing may be done with an ice pick and the puncture is correctly called <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>stab wound.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's brief did not dispute the finding of the trial
judge that <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was in </span>hiding for more than two years,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which may explain why the information against him could not be filed in 1981,
when Jaime <span class="SpellE">Mamucod</span> was killed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would also suggest that the
accused-appellant is not innocent as he claims, for as we have repeatedly
observed, unexplained flight is an indication of guilt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
"The guilty flee when no man <span class="SpellE">pursueth</span> but the
innocent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">are as </span>bold <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as a </span>lion."</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, there is the question of conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Floro</span> would
distance himself from Espinosa and impute the whole blame to his absent
co-accused for the killing of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Mamucod</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows, however, that they acted
in concert in pursuit of a common design.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Floro</span> and Espinosa together blocked Jaime's
jeep and told him not to disturb the basketball game (although there was none
in progress).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Floro</span>
first hit Jaime with the foot-long stick or pipe earlier concealed in a
newspaper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Espinosa drew his
fan-knife and stabbed Jaime in the back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then <span class="SpellE">Floro</span> drew his ice pick and stabbed Jaime
in the chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Jaime ran away from
them, they pursued him and continued stabbing him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, with their victim dying in the
ditch, both assailants fled together and disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is clear from their acts that the two had
come to an agreement concerning the attack on Jaime and decided to commit
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was thus a conspiracy that
made each conspirator liable for the other's acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree that the killing of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Mamucod</span>
was attended with treachery, qualifying the crime to murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim was totally defenseless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was caught by surprise when Espinosa and <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>, whom he considered his friends, suddenly attacked
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without warning, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>hit in the head, then stabbed in
the back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus disabled, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>stabbed in the chest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>he ran for his life, he was pursued and stabbed some more
when he stumbled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He never had a chance
to save his life.</p>

<p class="BODY">What prompted the vicious attack must remain a mystery to this
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof of motive is, of course,
not necessary for the conviction of the accused-appellant in view of his
positive identification <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>one
of the killers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even so, one may well
wonder why <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>human life was
taken for no apparent reason and another life must now be needlessly spent in
the shadow of the prison bars.</p>
