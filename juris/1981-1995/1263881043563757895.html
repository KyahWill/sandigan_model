<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Upon motion by the complaining witness, Juanita
Tan <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, the lower court ordered the consolidation of Criminal

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 27, on
February 17, 1989, rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

charged and the Court finds him CONVICTED of the crime of Robbery with Homicide
under Article 294, paragraph (1) of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no
mitigating nor aggravating circumstances to affect his penal liability, hereby
sentences him to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA and he is hereby
ordered to pay the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai the
amount of P30,000.00 for the fact of death, the sum of P20,000.00 for moral

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts as established by the prosecution are
summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence adduced by the prosecution thru its six (6)
witnesses, namely, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Janer</span> (Police Corporal,
WPD), Solomon <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span> y Torres (Patrolman, Homicide
Section, Investigation Division, WPD), Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>,
(Patrolman, Homicide Section WPD), <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Lucero
(Medico-legal Expert) <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> (Fire Sergeant, Fire District I) and Juanita Tan
(widow of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai), it appears that on October 4,
1983, at 3:35 o'clock a.m., a fire occurred at Supreme Bazaar and Sporting
Goods located at 532 <span class="SpellE">Ronquillo</span> St., Sta. Cruz,
Manila; that said fire was reported to the night watch duty fireman of the Sta.
Cruz Fire Station; that <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>, together with the fire fighting units of the
Sta. Cruz Fire Station went to the scene of the fire; that in order to put out
the fire which originated at the ground floor which was being occupied by
Supreme Bazaar and Sporting Goods, they forced open the front door of said
store; that when the front door was finally opened the bloody body of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai, owner of the store was found sprawling on the
floor (identified by Juanita Tan, wife of victim), that <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
T. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> made an inspection of the place and
interviewed a certain <span class="SpellE">Adora</span> and Juanita Tan, and
later on the same date, reduced his findings in writing entitled "Advanced
Fire Report" (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "L" and
"L-1"); that the incident was reported to the police by a fireman
from Sta. Cruz Fire Station and at 6:00 o'clock a.m. a team composed of
Corporal Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Janer</span>, Pat. Solomon <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span>, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Cahn</span> and Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> went to the scene of the crime and conducted an
ocular inspection of the place and interviewed some people about the incident;
that they saw the corpse of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai on the floor and
found the kitchen burned by a fire that started at the toilet being used as a
bodega; that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span> found a butcher's knife, a
kitchen knife and an <span class="SpellE">icepick</span>, all bloodstained and
submitted them to the NBI for examination; that they invited the employees of
the store (among them are accused <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>, Rodolfo Nicolas and Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>)
and Robert Yap; that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span> took the
statements of each of the employees and that of Robert Yap, a gay (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B", "B-1") who stated that he saw
three persons outside the store at past midnight of October 4, 1983, that one
of them is peeping at the store; that when asked to identify these three (3)
persons from among the employees of the store he failed to do so, but he
described the one peeping as tall, dark-complexioned, has curly hair and fat;
that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span> executed an advanced report
regarding the incident (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "A" and
"A-1"); that on October 8, 1983, about 12:00 o'clock midnight, Pfc.
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> received a phone call from Mrs.
Juanita Tan telling him that Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>, one of the
employees of the victim failed to show up on that date at <span class="SpellE">Funeraria</span>
Paz; that Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> went to the building being
occupied by the store's employees and conducted a search of the locker of Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>, and there he found Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong's</span>
bloody pants; that Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> together with Esteban <span class="SpellE">Acompañado</span>, cousin of Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>,
and the two (2) children of the victim went to <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
to look for Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>; that when they found him,
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> informed him of his constitutional rights
and frisked him for any weapon but instead found P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
from his pocket, which according to Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> was
given to him by <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>
as his share of the money stolen from <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai; that
Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>, the recovered bloody pants and the money
were turned over to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bataller</span></span><span class="GramE">; that after informing Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> of his
constitutional rights, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span> took the
statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "C", "C-1",
"C-2", "C-3", and "C-4") of Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> who admitted ownership of the pants and his presence
at the store during the robbery and killing of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
Tai and the burning of the store's bodega by <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> and Nicolas; that another amount of money was voluntarily
returned by Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong's</span> brother to the police making
a total recovery of P9,772.00; that the bloody pants of Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>
was turned over to the NBI and the money was returned to Juanita Tan; that <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> and Rodolfo Nicolas
were arrested by the police after having been implicated by Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>; that on October 10, 1983, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span>
prepared three (3) Booking and Information Sheets for accused Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> and Rodolfo Nicolas
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "F", "G", "H"
and "H-1"); that Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> signed, but <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> and Rodolfo Nicolas
refused to sign their respective Booking and Information Sheet; that on October
12, 1983, Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> gave his second statement (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "D", "D-1", "D-2",
"D-3, and "D-4") in the presence of Atty. Alexander Yap of the
Citizen's Legal Assistance Office affirming his first statement given on
October 8, 1983; that on October 13, 1983, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span>
prepared a progress Report (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "E" and
"E-1") of the results of their investigation; that on October 4,
1983, at 7:00 o'clock a.m., Dr. <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Lucero, a
medico-legal expert conducted an autopsy of the cadaver of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
Tai duly identified by the victims daughter, <span class="SpellE">Merrian</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "I"); that
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Lucero made a human sketch showing the
injuries inflicted on the victim (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "J"
and "J-1") and prepared the Certificate of Death of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "K" and
"K-1") stating that the cause of death was shock and hemorrhage due
to multiple hacking and stab wounds, blunt and impact injuries on the head,
neck and back (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "K-2"); that <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> and Rodolfo
Nicolas-and Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> attended the wake for four (4)
days; that according to Juanita Tan, Rodolfo Nicolas had worked with her
husband for seven to eight (7-8) months, Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>
for nine (9) months, while Rogue <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>, since 1971;
that <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> sometimes
does not report for work, or when he reports, is late; that Rodolfo Nicolas
sometimes answers back, while Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> is always
sleepy; that Juanita Tan spent P16,000.00 for the funeral (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"N"), and she also bought a lot from the <st1:place><st1:placename>Chinese</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Cemetery</st1:placetype></st1:place> for P45<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "O" and "O-1"); that she
estimated the damage due to fire at P80,000.00 and that the store's daily
income is P16,262.00 (wholesale) plus P5,844.00 (retail)." (RTC Decision,
pp. 2-4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 33-35)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The version of the defense is likewise condensed by the trial
court, <u>to</u> <u>wit</u>:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence adduced by the defense thru its five
witnesses, namely, Rodolfo Nicolas (accused), <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> (accused), Rolando Nicolas (brother of Rodolfo
Nicolas), <span class="SpellE">Librada</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>
(wife of <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>) and
Jose <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> (brother of Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>),
it appears that Rodolfo Nicolas has been an employee of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
Tai since January 1983, while <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> has been an employee of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
Tai since 1971; that both <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>
and Rodolfo Nicolas had a good relationship with <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
Tai whom they call papa; that on October 3, 1983, both Rodolfo Nicolas and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> reported for work and
<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> left the store
at 7:30 p.m. while Nicolas left at 8:00 o'clock p.m.; that Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> was left behind; that upon arrival at his house at
2434 <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> Reyes St., Sta. Cruz, Manila, Rodolfo
Nicolas ate and watched TV and then slept at 9:30 p.m. followed by his brothers
Rolando and <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> who slept beside him; that <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> arrived at his house
at <span class="SpellE">Pinaglabanan</span>, San Juan, Metro Manila at 9:00
o'clock p.m.; that upon arrival he ate and slept in the sala with his wife and
children; that both Rodolfo Nicolas and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> did not leave their houses during the evening of
October 3, 1983 and early morning of October 4, 1983; that at 2:30 a.m. of
October 4, 1983, when Rolando Nicolas urinated, he saw Rodolfo Nicolas still
asleep; that on October 4, 1983, Rodolfo Nicolas and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> reported for work, and were informed of the
robbery and killing of their employer, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai, and
the burning of the store; that when asked by the police about the incident,
they told them that they know nothing about it, that Rodolfo Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>, Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>, together with the other employees were brought to
the police headquarters and there Roberto Yap (who told the police that at past
midnight of October 4, 1983, he saw three persons outside Supreme Bazaar) was
asked to identify from among the employees the three (3) persons whom he saw
outside Supreme Bazaar, but he failed to identify them; that Rodolfo Nicolas
and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> attended
the wake from October 4 to October 8, 1983; that on October 8, 1983, Esteban <span class="SpellE">Acompañado</span> and they were asked by Juanita Tan to accompany
the policemen to look for Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> who failed to
attend the wake on October 8, 1983; that when Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>
was found and gave his statement, he implicated Rodolfo Nicolas and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>; that Rodolfo Nicolas
and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> were not
present when Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> gave his statement to the
police; that when <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>
and Rodolfo Nicolas learned about it, they denied their participation in the
robbery and killing of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai and the burning of the
store; that Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span>, one of the three accused, was
only 18 years old at the time of the commission of the crime as evidenced by
his Birth Certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) showing his date of
birth as September 21, 1965; that Gil <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> did not
take the witness stand to testify on his behalf." (RTC Decision, pp. 4-6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 35-37)</blockquote>

proof of each is confirmed by the proof of the other, and all without exception
leading by mutual support to but one conclusion, the circumstantial evidence
are sufficient to establish the culpability of the accused beyond reasonable

determining the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to support a conviction,
each case is to be determined on its own peculiar circumstances and all the
facts and circumstances are to be considered together as a whole, and when so
considered, may be sufficient to support a conviction, although one or more of
the facts taken separately would not be sufficient for this purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No general rule has been formulated as to the
quantity of circumstantial evidence which will suffice for any case but that
matters not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all that is required is
that the circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, and at the
same time inconsistent with the hypothesis that he is innocent and with every
other rational hypothesis except that of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Tested against the above standards, the trial court's finding of
guilt beyond reasonable doubt based on circumstantial evidence must be
reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, the admissions made by the accused-appellant during
custodial investigation as reflected in his sworn statement dated October 8,
1983 (Exhibit "C") cannot be admissible in evidence for his statement
before Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Bataller</span> was given in gross
violation of his constitutional rights as guaranteed under Article IV, Section
20 of the 1973 Constitution (now Article III, Section 12 of the 1987
Constitution).</p>

<p class="BODY">Article IV, section 20 of the 1973 Constitution provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"No person shall be compelled to be a witness against
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person under investigation
for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain silent and to
counsel, and to be informed of such right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No force, violence, threat, intimidation or any other means which
vitiates the free will shall be used against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any confession obtained in violation of this
section shall be inadmissible in evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the accused-appellant gave an <span class="SpellE">uncounselled</span> confession before the investigating officer
who simply asked as one of the preliminary questions before the
accused-appellant made his declarations relating to the crime of robbery with
homicide that:</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the records are bereft of any proof that the
accused-appellant knowingly rejected having a lawyer assist him during the taking
of the extrajudicial confession in question, our ruling in the case of <u>People</u>
<u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Jara</u></span>, 144 SCRA 516, 531 [1986] bears
reiteration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Whenever a protection given by the Constitution is waived by
the person entitled to that protection the presumption is always against the
waiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the prosecution
must prove with strongly convincing evidence to the satisfaction of this Court
that indeed the accused willingly and voluntarily submitted his confession and
knowingly and deliberately manifested that he was not interested in having a
lawyer assist him during the taking of that confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That proof is missing in this case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The ban against <span class="SpellE">uncounselled</span>
confessions is even more pronounced under the Bill of Rights of the 1987
Constitution which categorically states that:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 12 (1) Any person under investigation for the commission
of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent
and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his own choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the person cannot afford the services of

counsel.</blockquote>

</span><span class="GramE">(Article III, Section 12, subparagraphs (1) and (3) of
the 1987 Constitution.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, after 1987 regardless of whether or not the confession of
the accused is true, as long as it was given without the assistance of counsel,
it becomes inadmissible in evidence although it was a product of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> own free will and volition in view of the current
policy with respect to extrajudicial confessions based on the Bill of
Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People v.

[1988] and People v. Newman, 163 SCRA 496 [1988]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, even granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that the extrajudicial confession of the accused-appellant is admissible in
evidence, the accused-appellant's admission that he was merely present at the
scene of the crime without any convincing proof that he participated in the
particular crime of robbery with homicide falls short of the requisite quantum
of proof to sustain a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
confession, <span class="SpellE">Tapong</span> charged the two other <span class="GramE">co-accused</span> Rodolfo Nicolas and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dilao</span> (whom the trial court exonerated from the crime
of robbery with homicide) as the authors of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He disclaimed any
participation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He confessed only to
being present as an eyewitness to the killing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also admitted that the money recovered from him was given by <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the wife of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Tai, Juanita Tan, as proof of the robbery to the effect
that the money recovered by the police from the accused-appellant bore her
husband's writings strains credulity (TSN, November 25, 1985, p. 8) in the
absence of concrete proof in support of the statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The money with alleged handwriting of the
victim on the bills was not introduced as evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not shown why <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
Tai should scribble on money bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere
speculations and probabilities cannot substitute for the proof required by law
to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt inasmuch as the
conviction for a criminal offense must be based on clear and positive
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Gaerlan</span> v. Court of Appeals and People, 179 SCRA 20 [1989];

<p class="BODY">Secondly, anent the flight of the accused on the fourth day after
the incident in question, the trial court erred in appreciating the
accused-appellant's absence on the fourth day of the victim's wake as
indicative of flight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly
pointed out by the Solicitor General who concurs in this assigned error, the
flight contemplated by jurisprudence must be immediate to the commission of the
crime (People's Brief, p. 13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case at bar, there is clear indication that the accused-appellant never
intended to go into hiding since he was among the employees who stayed in the
deceased's store when told to do so by Juanita Tan in order to be available for
questioning by the police investigators.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(TSN, November 21, 1986, pp. 10-11; 21-23).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even attended the wake of the deceased for
the first three days (TSN, Ibid, pp. 29-32; July 8, 1987, p. 6; TSN, November
25, 1985, p. 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we find the
legal maxim "the guilty flee when no man <span class="SpellE">pursueth</span>
but the innocent are as bold as a lion" inapplicable in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Ablao</span>, 183 SCRA 658 [1990] citing People v. Espinosa, 180
SCRA 398 [1989]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, the recovery by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>
of the bloodstained pants of the accused-appellant who admitted ownership does
not have any probative value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Solicitor General agrees with this assigned error and points out that the pants
were never introduced in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records show that the pair of pants and the contents were brought by the police
to headquarters but it is inexplicable that only the hearsay testimony of a
policeman on the matter was adduced.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence of the blood-type matching of the said stains on
the pants and the blood of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our pronouncement in the case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Padilla</u>
(177 SCRA 129 [1989]) is relevant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
bloodstains on the polo, shirt and pants of appellant without any corresponding
evidence of the blood type matching that of the victim will not be sufficient
to convict the appellant (Cf. People v. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
L-50103 November 24, 1986; 145 SCRA 597)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In fact, it is not even shown that the blood was human and not
that of animals or fowl used for food.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only one circumstance remains from the admission - the money given by <span class="SpellE">Dilao</span>, which is not proof of participation in the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that circumstantial evidence, as a basis for
conviction of a crime should be acted on and weighed with great caution,
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Jara</span>, <u>supra</u>) particularly when the
law metes the highest imposable penalty under the present state of the law
which is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, we are
constrained to depart from the well-entrenched rule that the trial court's
findings must be accorded great respect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We repeat our pronouncement in the case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Aldana</u></span> (175 SCRA 635, 650 [1989] that:</p>

<blockquote>"While the court generally desists from disturbing the
findings of the trial court, considering that the latter is in a better
position to pass upon the matter of credibility of witnesses, the Court will
not hesitate to take exception to this rule in order to keep faith with the
principle that every criminal conviction must be supported by proof beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People

the test of moral certainty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

responsibility of the offense charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Dramayo</span>, 42 SCRA 59
[1971])."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Trial courts, as <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of facts, are
bound by the hard and fast rule in evidence that before there can be conviction
based on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances proved must constitute an
unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to
the defendant, to the exclusion of all others, as the authors of the crime
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de la Cruz, et al., G.R. Nos.
90907-12, August 7, 1991 citing People v. Tolentino, 166 SCRA 469 [1988];

<span class="SpellE">Colinares</span>, 163 SCRA 313 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police investigators and the prosecution
did not show the degree of professionalism, competence and thoroughness so
essential in the light of the leads staring them in the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have advanced in our appreciation of human
rights but the police have unfortunately not kept pace with modern developments
and techniques in the investigation of crimes.<span style="">&nbsp;

in the light of the circumstances which prosecution failed to prove.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution failed to overcome the
constitutional presumption of innocence.</p>
