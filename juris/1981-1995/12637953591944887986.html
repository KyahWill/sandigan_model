				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>, petitioners
challenge the assumption of jurisdiction by Respondent Judge of the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, Branch XII, over a
complaint for <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> filed by private respondent,
Philippine Tuna Ventures, Inc. against petitioners, upon the allegation that it
is intertwined with a labor dispute so that exclusive jurisdiction belongs to
the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Philippine Tuna Ventures, Inc. (TUNA, Inc., for
short,) is the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> of the fishing vessel, the
F/B Caribbean (hereinafter referred to simply as the Vessel).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>TUNA, Inc. has been operating this Vessel in
its deep-sea fishing business since 1977 together with eight (8) other fishing
boats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1985, TUNA, Inc.
transferred the operation of the Vessel to a sister corporation, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Eastship</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> Fishing Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Eastship</span>,
for brevity).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, twenty-four
(24) in all, constitute the crew of the Vessel, with petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Basaya</span>, Jr., as its
Captain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 July 1986, TUNA, Inc. sought the remedy of <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> (the <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> Case)
against petitioners before the Regional Trial Court presided over by Respondent
Judge, praying that petitioners (defendants in that case) be ordered to deliver
to it the possession of its Vessel, which petitioners were allegedly possessing
in violation of its rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their defense below petitioners maintained that they were in
possession of the Vessel as its crew; that their possession is "an
extension of the possession of the plaintiff over the Vessel" and that to
deprive them of its possession by a Writ of <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span>
would amount to an illegal termination of their employment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">10 July
 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, the Writ of <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> was ordered issued upon TUNA, Inc.'s filing of a
bond in the amount of P2M.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff
served the Writ on petitioners on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">12 July 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> and they disembarked from the Vessel in the
evening of that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after
about an hour, they re-embarked and re-took possession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="8">29 August 1986</st1:date>
judgment was rendered in the <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> Case declaring
TUNA, Inc. to have a better right to the possession of the Vessel and ordering
petitioners to immediately deliver possession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">15
 September 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">
petitioners resorted to this appeal by <i>certiorari</i> on a question of law
with a prayer for a restraining order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="9">17 September 1986</st1:date>
we issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining respondents from enforcing
the judgment in the <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> Case or any Writ of
Execution issued therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue for resolution is whether or not the Trial Court
had jurisdiction to hear and decide the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Replevin</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> Case.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said Court upheld its jurisdiction and ruled, as heretofore <span class="GramE">stated,</span> that the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>, TUNA,
Inc., has a better right to the possession of the Vessel and ordered
petitioners to immediately deliver possession.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In this Petition,
petitioners argue that the Trial Court erred in:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“I.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>assuming a split
jurisdiction over the civil rights of the respondent corporation to possess the
vessel F/B Caribbean and oust the petitioners-appellants separately from the
labor rights of the petitioners-appellants to be protected from their sudden
arbitrary ouster from their positions in the said vessel as crew members and
officers thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“II.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> holding that the legal responsibility of the respondent,
Philippine Tuna Ventures, Inc. as the employer of the petitioners-appellants
has been transferred to <span class="SpellE">Eastship</span> Fishing Corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“III.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> assuming jurisdiction over this case which involves the
labor violation of unfair labor practice committed by the respondent Phil. Tuna
Ventures, Inc. and which, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">therefore,
appertains to the exclusive jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations
Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on 26 June 1986, petitioners had presented to the
management of TUNA, Inc., a set of labor demands; that on 28 June 1986 they had
informed <span class="SpellE">Eastship</span> that they would not move the Vessel
to any destination until their demands were met; that on 2 July 1986 TUNA,
Inc., had applied for a "shut-down" or closure allegedly due to
business losses; that on 8 July 1986 <span class="SpellE">Eastship</span> filed
with the National Labor Relations Commission, Regional Office No. 7, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, a Petition to declare petitioners' strike
illegal; and that on 8 August 1986, petitioners instituted a Complaint for
Unfair Labor Practice against TUNA, Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Eastship</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, petitioners allege that they
are not on strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">Developments subsequent to the judgment in the <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> Case also disclose that on 18 November 1986, in
NLRC Injunction Case No. 1270 entitled <span class="SpellE">Eastship</span>
Fishing Corporation vs. Concerned Seamen of the Philippines, the NLRC issued an
Injunction Writ enjoining petitioners from blocking the free ingress and egress
to the Vessel and seven (7) other fishing boats and to disembark from and
vacate the Vessel without prejudice to the exercise of their right to lawful
and peaceful picketing; that on 28 November 1986, the NLRC Sheriffs attempted
to enforce the Injunction but petitioners refused to comply thereby compelling
the NLRC on the same date to seek the assistance of the Philippine Constabulary
and the Philippine Coast Guard; that it was only on 11 December 1986, after a
series of refusals, that petitioners left the Vessel peacefully only to retake
possession on 16 December 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">An ocular inspection on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="1">10
 January 1987</st1:date> by <span class="SpellE">Eastship</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">disclosed that
petitioners were still in possession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Upon the facts and issue
involved, we uphold the jurisdiction of the </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Civil Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Replevin</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> is a <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
action, the gist of which is the right of possession in the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary relief sought therein is the
return of the property in specie wrongfully detained by another person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an ordinary statutory proceeding to
adjudicate rights to the title or possession of personal property (Francisco,
The Revised Rules of Court, Provisional Remedies, 1985, p. 386, citing 46 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
question of whether or not a party has the right of possession over the
property involved and if so, whether or not the adverse party has wrongfully
taken and detained said property as to require its return to plaintiff, is
outside the pale of competence of a labor tribunal; it is beyond the field of
specialization of Labor Arbiters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The Trial Court,
therefore, rightfully assumed jurisdiction over the <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span>
Case and aptly held that, as <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> of the Vessel,
TUNA, Inc. has the better right of possession and that petitioners' alleged
right to possess the Vessel as the crew thereof is not in any way superior to
the right of TUNA, Inc. as such <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> or lessee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The labor dispute
involved is not intertwined with the issue in the <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span>
Case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respective issues raised in
each forum can be resolved independently of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">18 November 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, the NLRC in the case before it had issued
an Injunctive Writ enjoining petitioners from blocking the free ingress and
egress to the Vessel and ordering petitioners to disembark and vacate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That aspect of the controversy is properly
settled under the Labor </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">So also with petitioners'
right to picket.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the
determination of the question of who has the better right to take possession of
the Vessel and whether petitioners can deprive the <span class="SpellE">Charterer</span>,
as the legal possessor of the Vessel, of that right to possess is addressed to
the competence of Civil Courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In thus ruling, this Court is not sanctioning split jurisdiction
but defining avenues of jurisdiction as <span class="GramE">laid</span> down by
pertinent laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court takes note that petitioners have defied not only the
Writ of <span class="SpellE">Replevin</span> issued by the <st1:street><st1:address>Civil
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> but also the Injunction ordered by the
NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners must be reminded that
rights are not their exclusive prerogative but are enjoyed by others as
well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They must yield to the rule of law
and not rely on the law of force, <span class="GramE">specially</span> where
adjudicative bodies and Courts have ruled upon the merits of their claims
although adversely to them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment under review is hereby AFFIRMED
and petitioners are hereby ORDERED to disembark from the F/B Caribbean and to
turn over possession of said vessel to private respondent Philippine Tuna
Ventures, Inc., without prejudice to the continued prosecution of their demands
for labor benefits before the labor tribunal, which will surely be protective
of their just deserts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Temporary
Restraining Order issued by this Court on <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="9">17 September 1986</st1:date> is hereby LIFTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Treble costs against petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">This judgment is
immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
