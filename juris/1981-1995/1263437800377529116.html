Server, respectively, of the Municipal Trial Court of Tinambac, Camarines
Sur.  Respondents Judge Lucio P.
Palaypayon, Jr. and Nelia B. Esmeralda-Baroy are respectively the Presiding
Judge and Clerk of Court II of the same court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an administrative complaint filed with the Office of the Court
Administrator on October 5, 1992, herein respondents were charged with the
following offenses, to wit:  (1) illegal
solemnization of marriage; (2) falsification of the monthly reports of cases;
(3) bribery in consideration of an appointment in the court; (4) non-issuance
of receipt for cash bond received; (5) infidelity in the custody of detained
prisoners; and (6) requiring payment of filing fees from exempted entities.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to a resolution issued by this Court respondents filed their
respective Comments.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

The case was thereafter referred to Executive Judge David C. Naval of the
Regional Trial Court, Naga City, for investigation report and
recommendation.  The case was however
transferred to First Assistant Executive Judge Antonio N. Gerona when Judge
Naval inhibited himself for the reason that his wife is a cousin of respondent
Judge Palaypayon, Jr.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contending versions of the parties regarding the factual
antecedents of this administrative matter, as culled from the records thereof,
are set out under each particular charge against respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Illegal solemnization
of marriage</i></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainants allege that respondent judge solemnized marriages
even without the requisite marriage license.  Thus, the following couples were able to get married by the simple
expedient of paying the marriage fees to respondent Baroy, despite the absence
of a marriage license, <i>viz.</i>:  Alano P. Abellano and Nelly Edralin, Francisco Selpo and Julieta
Carrido, Eddie Terrobias and Maria Gacer, Renato Gamay and Maricris Belga,
Arsenio Sabater and Margarita Nacario, and Sammy Bocaya and Gina Bismonte.  As a consequence, their marriage contracts
(Exhibits B, C, D, F, G, and A, respectively) did not reflect any marriage
license number.  In addition, respondent
judge did not sign their marriage contracts and did not indicate the date of
solemnization, the reason being that he allegedly had to wait for the marriage
license to be submitted by the parties which was usually several days after the
ceremony.  Indubitably, the marriage
contracts were not filed with the local civil registrar.  Complainant Ramon Sambo, who prepares the
marriage contracts, called the attention of respondents to the lack of marriage
licenses and its effect on the marriages involved, but the latter opted to
proceed with the celebration of said marriages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Nelia Baroy claims that when she was appointed Clerk
of Court II, the employees of the court were already hostile to her, especially
complainant Ramon Sambo who told her that he was filing a protest against her
appointment.  She avers that it was only
lately when she discovered that the court had a Marriage Register which is in
the custody of Sambo; that it was Sambo who failed to furnish the parties
copies of the marriage contract and to register these with the local civil
registrar; and that apparently Sambo kept these marriage contracts in
preparation for this administrative case.  Complainant Sambo, however, claims that all file copies of the marriage
contracts were kept by respondent Baroy; but the latter insists that she had
instructed Sambo to follow up the submission by the contracting parties of
their marriage licenses as part of his duties but he failed to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge Palaypayon, Jr. contends that the marriage
between Alano P. Abellano and Nelly Edralin falls under Article 34 of the Civil
Code, hence it is exempt from the marriage license requirement; that he gave
strict instructions to complainant Sambo to furnish the couple a copy of the
marriage contract and to file the same with the civil registrar, but the latter
failed to do so; that in order to solve the problem, the spouses subsequently
formalized their marriage by securing a marriage license and executing their
marriage contract, a copy of which was filed with the civil registrar; that the
other five marriages alluded to in the administrative complaint were not
illegally solemnized because the marriage contracts were not signed by him and
they did not contain the date and place of marriage; that copies of these
marriage contracts are in the custody of complainant Sambo; that the alleged
marriage of Francisco Selpo and Julieta Carrido, Eddie Terrobias ande Maria
Emma Gaor, Renato Gamay and Maricris Belga, and of Arsenio Sabater and
Margarita Nacario were not celebrated by him since he refused to solemnize them
in the absence of a marriage license; that the marriage of Samy Bocaya and Gina
Bismonte was celebrated even without the requisite license due to the
insistence of the parties in order to avoid embarrassment to their guests but
that, at any rate, he did not sign their marriage contract which remains
unsigned up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Falsification of
monthly report for July, 1991 regarding the number of marriages solemnized and
the number of documents notarized.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It is alleged that respondent judge made it appear that he
solemnized seven (7) marriages in the month of July, 1992, when in truth he did
not do so or at most those marriages were null and void; that respondents
likewise made it appear that they have notarized only six (6) documents for
July, 1992, but the Notarial Register will show that there were one hundred
thirteen (113) documents which were notarized during that month; and that
respondents reported a notarial fee of only P18.50 for each document, although
in fact they collected P20.00 therefor and failed to account for the
difference.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Baroy contends, however, that the marriage registry
where all marriages celebrated by respondent judge are entered is under the
exclusive control and custody of complainant Ramon Sambo, hence he is the only
one who should be held responsible for the entries made therein; that the
reported marriages are merely based on the payments made as solemnization fees
which are in the custody of respondent Baroy.  She further avers that it is Sambo who is likewise the custodian of the
Notarial Register; that she cannot be held accountable for whatever alleged
difference there is in the notarial fees because she is liable only for those
payments tendered to her by Sambo himself; that the notarial fees she collects
are duly covered by receipts; that of the P20.00 charged, P18.50 is remitted
directly to the Supreme Court as part of the Judiciary Development Fund and
P150 goes to the general fund of the Supreme Court which is paid to the
Municipal Treasurer of Tinambac, Camarines Sur.  Respondent theorizes that the discrepancies in the monthly report
were manipulated by complainant Sambo considering that he is the one in charge
of the preparation of the monthly report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge Palaypayon avers that the erroneous number of
marriages celebrated was intentionally placed by complainant Sambo; that the
number of marriages solemnized should not be based on solemnization fees paid
for that month since not all the marriages paid for are solemnized in the same
month.  He claims that there were
actually only six (6) documents notarized in the month of July, 1992 which
tallied with the official receipts issued by the clerk of court; that it is
Sambo who should be held accountable for any unreceipted payment for notarial
fees because he is the one in charge of the Notarial Register; and that this
case filed by complainant Sambo is merely in retaliation for his failure to be
appointed as the clerk of court.  Furthermore, respondent judge contends that he is not the one
supervising or preparing the monthly report, and that he merely has the
ministerial duty to sign the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Bribery in
consideration of an appointment in the court</i></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainants allege that because of the retirement of the clerk
of court, respondent judge forwarded to the Supreme Court the applications of
Rodel Abogado, Ramon Sambo, and Jessell Abiog.  However, they were surprised when respondent Baroy reported for duty as
clerk of court on October 21, 1991.  They later found out that respondent Baroy was the one appointed because
she gave a brand-new air-conditioning unit to respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Baroy claims that when she was still in Naga City she
purchased an air-conditioning unit but when she was appointed clerk of court
she had to transfer to Tinambac and, since she no longer needed the air
conditioner, she decided to sell the same to respondent judge.  The installation and use thereof by the
latter in his office was with the consent of the Mayor of Tinambac.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge contends that he endorsed all the applications
for the position of clerk of court to the Supreme Court which has the sole
authority over such appointments and that he had no hand in the appointment of
respondent Baroy.  He contends that the
air-conditioning unit was bought from his co-respondent on installment basis on
May 29, 1992, eight (8) months after Baroy had been appointed clerk of
court.  He claims that he would not be that
naive to exhibit to the public as item which could not be defended as a matter
of honor and prestige.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cash bond issued
without a receipt<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It is alleged that in Criminal Case No. 5438, entitled “People
vs. Mendeza, et al.,” bondswoman Januaria Dacara was allowed by respondent
judge to change her property bond to cash bond; that she paid the amount of
P1,000.00 but was never issued a receipt therefor nor was it made to appear in
the records that the bond has been paid; that despite the lapse of two years,
the money was never returned to the bondswoman; and that it has not been shown
that the money was turned over to the Municipal Treasurer of Tinambac.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Baroy counters that the cash bond was deposited with
the former clerk of court, then turned over to the acting clerk of court and,
later, given to her under a corresponding receipt; that the cash bond is
deposited with the bank; and that should the bondswoman desire to withdraw the
same, she should follow the proper procedure therefor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge contends that Criminal Case No. 5438 was
archived for failure of the bondsman to deliver the body of the accused in
court despite notice; and that he has nothing to do with the payment of the
cash bond as this is the duty of the clerk of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Infidelity in the
custody of prisoners<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainants contend that respondent judge usually got detention
prisoners to work in his house, one of whom was Alex Alano, who is accused in
Criminal Case No. 5647 for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act; that while
Alano was in the custody of respondent judge, the former escaped and was never
recaptured; that in order to conceal this fact, the case was archived pursuant
to an order issued by respondent judge dated April 6, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge denied the accusation and claims that he never
employed detention prisoners and that he has adequate household help; and that
he had to order the case archived because it had been pending for more than six
(6) months and the accused therein remained at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Unlawful collection
of docket fees</i></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, respondents are charged with collecting docket fees from
the Rural Bank of Tinambac, Camarines Sur, Inc. although such entity is exempt
by law from the payment of said fees, and that while the corresponding receipt was
issued, respondent Baroy failed to remit the amount to the Supreme Court and,
instead, she deposited the same in her personal account.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Baroy contends that it was Judge-Designate Felimon
Montenegro (because respondent judge was on sick leave) who instructed her to
demand payment of docket fees from said rural bank; that the bank issued a
check for P800.00; that she was not allowed by the Philippine National Bank to
encash the check and, instead, was instructed to deposit the same in any bank account
for clearing; that respondent deposited the same in her account; and that after
the check was cleared, she remitted P400.00 to the Supreme Court and the other
P400.00 was paid to the Municipal Treasurer of Tinambac.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing contentions, First Vice-Executive
Judge Antonio N. Gerona prepared and submitted to us his Report and
Recommendations dated May 20, 1994, together with the administrative
matter.  We have perspicaciously
reviewed the same and we are favorably impressed by the thorough and exhaustive
presentation and analysis of the facts and evidence in said report.  We commend the investigating judge for his
industry and perspicacity reflected by his findings in said report which, being
amply substantiated by the evidence and supported by logical illations, we
hereby approve and hereunder reproduce at length the material portions thereof.</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The first charge against the respondents is illegal solemnization
of marriage.  Judge Palaypayon is
charged with having solemnized without a marriage license the marriage of Sammy
Bocaya and Gina Besmonte (Exh. A), Alano Abeliano and Nelly Edralin (Exh. B),
Francisco Selpo and Julieta Carrido (Exh. C), Eddie Terrobias and Maria Emma
Gaor (Exh. D), Renato Gamay and Maricris Belga (Exh. F) and Arsenio Sabater and
Margarita Nacario (Exh. G).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In all these aforementioned marriages, the blank space in the
marriage contracts to show the number of the marriage was solemnized as
required by Article 22 of the Family Code were not filled up.  While the contracting parties and their
witnesses signed their marriage contracts, Judge Palaypayon did not affix his
signature in the marriage contracts, except that of Abellano and Edralin when
Judge Palaypayon signed their marriage certificate as he claims that he
solemnized this marriage under Article 34 of the Family Code of the
Philippines.  In said marriages the
contracting parties were not furnished a copy of their marriage contract and
the Local Civil Registrar was not sent either a copy of the marriage
certificate as required by Article 23 of the Family Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The marriage of Bocaya and Besmonte is shown to have been
solemnized by Judge Palaypayon without a marriage license.  The testimonies of Bocay himself and Pompeo
Ariola, one of the witnesses of the marriage of Bocaya and Besmonte, and the
photographs taken when Judge Palaypayon solemnized their marriage (Exhs. K-3 to
K-9) sufficiently show that Judge Palaypayon really solemnized their
marriage.  Bocaya declared that they
were advised by Judge Palaypayon to return after ten (10) days after their
marriage was solemnized and bring with them their marriage license.  In the meantime, they already started living
together as husband and wife believing that the formal requisites of marriage
were complied with.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon denied that he solemnized the marriage of Bocaya
and Besmonte because the parties allegedly did not have a marriage
license.  He declared that in fact he
did not sign the marriage certificate, there was no date stated on it and both the
parties and the Local Civil Registrar did not have a copy of the marriage
certificate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to the photographs which show that he solemnized the
marriage of Bocaya and Besmonte, Judge Palaypayon explains that they merely
show as if he was solemnizing the marriage.  It was actually a simulated solemnization of marriage and not a real
one.  This happened because of the
pleading of the mother of one of the contracting parties that he consent to be
photographed to show that as if he was solemnizing the marriage as he was told
that the food for the wedding reception was already prepared, visitors were
already invited and the place of the parties where the reception would be held
was more than twenty (20) kilometers away from the poblacion of Tinambac.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The denial made by Judge Palaypayon is difficult to believe.  The fact alone that he did not sign the
marriage certificate or contract, the same did not bear a date and the parties
and the Local Civil Registrar were not furnished a copy of the marriage certificate,
do not by themselves show that he did not solemnize the marriage.  His uncorroborated testimony cannot prevail
over the testimony of Bocaya and Ariola who also declared, among others, that
Bocaya and his bride were advised by Judge Palaypayon to return after ten (10)
days with their marriage license and whose credibility had not been impeached.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The pictures taken also from the start of the wedding ceremony up
to the signing of the marriage certificate in front of Judge Palaypayon and on
his table (Exhs. K-3, K-3-a, K-3-b, K-3-c, K-4, K-4-a, K-4-b, K-4-c, K-4-d,
K-5, K-5-a, K-5-b, K-6, K-7, K-8, K-8-a and K-9), cannot possibly be just to
show a simulated solemnization of marriage.  One or two pictures may convince a person of the explanation of Judge
Palaypayon, but not all those pictures.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Besides, as a judge it is very difficult to believe that Judge
Palaypayon would allows himself to be photographed as if he was solemnizing a
marriage on a mere pleading of a person whom he did not even know for the
alleged reasons given.  It would be
highly improper and unbecoming of him to allow himself to be used as an
instrument of deceit by making it appear that Bocaya and Besmonte were married
by him when in truth and in fact he did not solemnize their marriage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to the marriage of Abellano and Edralin (Exh. B),
Judge Palaypayon admitted that he solemnized their marriage, but he claims that
it was under Article 34 of the Family Code, so a marriage license was not
required.  The contracting parties here
executed a joint affidavit that they have been living together as husband and
wife for almost six (6) years already (Exh. 12; Exh. AA).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In their marriage contract which did not bear any date either when
it was solemnized, it was stated that Abellano was only eighteen (18) years,
two (2) months and seven (7) days old.  If he and Edralin had been living together as husband and wife for
almost six (6) years already before they got married as they stated in their
joint affidavit, Abellano must ha(ve) been less than thirteen (13) years old
when he started living with Edralin as his wife and this is hard to
believe.  Judge Palaypayon should ha(ve)
been aware of this when he solemnized their marriage as it was his duty to
ascertain the qualification of the contracting parties who might ha(ve)
executed a false joint affidavit in order to have an instant marriage by
avoiding the marriage license requirement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 23, 1992, however, after this case was already filed, Judge
Palaypayon married again Abellano and Edralin, this time with a marriage
license (Exh. BB).  The explanation
given by Judge Palaypayon why he solemnized the marriage of the same couple for
the second time is that he did not consider the first marriage he solemnized
under Article 34 of the Family Code as (a) marriage at all because complainant
Ramon Samba did not follow his instruction that the date should be placed in
the marriage certificate to show when he solemnized the marriage and that the
contracting parties were not furnished a copy of their marriage certificate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This act of Judge Palaypayon of solemnizing the marriage of
Abellano and Edralin for the second time with a marriage license already only
gave rise to the suspicion that the first time he solemnized the marriage it
was only made to appear that it was solemnized under exceptional character as
there was not marriage license and Judge Palaypayon had already signed the
marriage certificate.  If it was true
that he solemnized the first marriage under exceptional character where a
marriage license was not required, why did he already require the parties to
have a marriage license when he solemnized their marriage for the second time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>The explanation of Judge Palaypayon that the first marriage of
Abellano and Edralin was not a marriage at all as the marriage certificate did
not state the date when the marriage was solemnized and that the contracting
parties were not furnished a copy of their marriage certificate, is not well
taken as they are not any of those grounds under Article(s) 35, 36, 37 and 38
of the Family Code which declare a marriage void from the beginning.  Even if no one, however, received a copy of
the marriage certificate, the marriage is still valid (Jones vs. H(o)rtiguela,
64 Phil. 179).  Judge Palaypayon cannot
just absolve himself from responsibility by blaming his personnel.  They are not the guardian(s) of his official
function and under Article 23 of the Family Code it is his duty to furnish the
contracting parties (a) copy of their marriage contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to the marriage of Francisco Selpo and Julieta Carrido
(Exh. C), and Arsenio Sabater and Margarita Nacario (Exh. G), Selpo and Carrido
and Sabater and Nacario executed joint affidavits that Judge Palaypayon did not
solemnize their marriage (Exh. 13-A and Exh. 1).  Both Carrido and Nacario testified for the respondents that
actually Judge Palaypayon did not solemnize their marriage as they did not have
a marriage license.  On cross-examination,
however, both admitted that they did not know who prepared their affidavits.  They were just told, Carrido by a certain
Charito Palaypayon, and Nacario by a certain Kagawad Encinas, to just go to the
Municipal building and sign their joint affidavits there which were already
prepared before the Municipal Mayor of Tinambac, Camarines Sur.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to the marriage of Renato Gamay and Maricris Belga
(Exh. f), their marriage contract was signed by them and by their two (2)
witnesses, Atty. Elmer Brioso and respondent Baroy (Exhs. F-1 and F-2).  Like the other aforementioned marriages, the
solemnization fee was also paid as shown by a receipt dated June 7, 1992 and
signed by respondent Baroy (Exh. F-4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon also denied having solemnized the marriage of
Gamay and Belga allegedly because there was no marriage license.  On her part, respondent Baroy at first
denied that the marriage was solemnized.  When she was asked, however, why did she sign the marriage contract as a
witness she answered that she thought the marriage was already solemnized (TSN,
p. 14; 10­-28-93).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Baroy was, and is, the clerk of court of Judge
Palaypayon.  She signed the marriage
contract of Gamay and Belga as one of the two principal sponsors.  Yet, she wanted to give the impression that
she did not even know that the marriage was solemnized by Judge
Palaypayon.  This is found very
difficult to believe.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon made the same denial of having solemnized also the
marriage of Terrobias and Gaor (Exh. D).  The contracting parties and their witnesses also signed the marriage
contract and paid the solemnization fee, but Judge Palaypayon allegedly did not
solemnize their marriage due to lack of marriage license.  Judge Palaypayon submitted the affidavit of
William Medina, Vice-Mayor of Tinambac, to corroborate his testimony (Exh.
14).  Medina, however, did not testify
in this case and so his affidavit has no probative value.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon testified that his procedure and practice have
been that before the contracting parties and their witnesses enter his chamber
in order to get married, he already required complainant Ramon Sambo to whom he
assigned the task of preparing the marriage contract, to already let the
parties and their witnesses sign their marriage contracts, as what happened to
Gamay and Belga, and Terrobias and Gaor, among others.  His purpose was to save his precious time as
he has been solemnizing marriages at the rate of three (3) to four (4) times
everyday (TSN, p. 12; 2-1-94).</blockquote>

<blockquote>This alleged practice and procedure, if true, is highly improper
and irregular, if not illegal, because the contracting parties are supposed to
be first asked by the solemnizing officer and declare that they take each other
as husband and wife before the solemnizing officer in the presence of at least
two (2) witnesses before they are supposed to sign their marriage contracts
(Art. 6, Family Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The uncorroborated testimony, however, of Judge Palaypayon as to
his alleged practice and procedure before solemnizing a marriage, is not true
as shown by the picture taken during the wedding of Bocaya and Besmonte (Exhs.
K-3 to K-9) and by the testimony of respondent Baroy herself who declared that
the practice of Judge Palaypayon ha(s) been to let the contracting parties and
their witnesses sign the marriage contract only after Judge Palaypayon has solemnized
their marriage (TSN, p. 53; 10-28-93).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon did not present any evidence to show also that he
was really solemnizing three (3) to four (4) marriages everyday.  On the contrary his monthly report of cases
for July, 1992 shows that his court had only twenty-seven (27) pending cases
and he solemnized only seven (7) marriages for the whole month (Exh. E).  His monthly report of cases for September,
1992 shows also that he solemnized only four (4) marriages during the whole
month (Exh. 7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this first charge of having illegally solemnized marriages,
respondent Judge Palaypayon has presented and marked in evidence several
marriage contracts of other persons, affidavits of persons and certification
issued by the Local Civil Registrar (Exhs. 12-B to 12-H).  These persons who executed affidavits,
however, did not testify in this case.  Besides, the marriage contracts and certification mentioned are
immaterial as Judge Palaypayon is not charged of having solemnized these
marriages illegally also.  He is not
charged that the marriages he solemnized were all illegal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The second charge against herein respondents, that of having
falsified the monthly report of cases submitted to the Supreme Court and not
stating in the monthly report the actual number of documents notarized and
issuing the corresponding receipts of the notarial fees, have been sufficiently
proven by the complainants insofar as the monthly report of cases for July and
September, 1992 are concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The monthly report of cases of the MTC of Tinambac, Camarines Sur
for July, 1992 both signed by the respondents, show that for said month there
were six (6) documents notarized by Judge Palaypayon in his capacity as
Ex-Officio Notary Public (Exhs. H to H-1-b).  The notarial register of the MTC of Tinambac, Camarines Sur, however,
shows that there were actually one hundred thirteen (113) documents notarized
by Judge Palaypayon for the said month (Exhs. Q to Q-45).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon claims that there was no falsification of the
monthly report of cases for July, 1992 because there were only six (6)
notarized documents that were paid (for) as shown by official receipts.  He did not, however, present evidence of the
alleged official receipts showing that the notarial fee for the six (6)
documents were paid.  Besides, the
monthly report of cases with respect to the number of documents notarized
should not be based on how many notarized documents were paid of the notarial
fees, but the number of documents placed or recorded in the notarial register.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon admitted that he was not personally verifying and
checking anymore the correctness of the monthly reports because he relies on
his co-respondent who is the Clerk of Court and whom he has assumed to have checked
and verified the records.  He merely
signs the monthly report when it is already signed by respondent Baroy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The explanation of Judge Palaypayon is not well taken because he is
required to have close supervision in the preparation of the monthly report of
cases of which he certifies as to their correctness.  As a judge he is personally responsible for the proper discharge
of his functions (The Phil. Trial Lawyer’s Asso. Inc. vs. Agana, Sr., 102 SCRA
517).  In Nidera vs. Lazaro, 174 SCRA
581, it was held that “A judge cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency or
mismanagement of his court personnel.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the part of respondent Baroy, she puts the blame of the
falsification of the monthly report of cases on complainant Sambo whom she
allegedly assigned to prepare not only the monthly report of cases, but the
preparation and custody of marriage contracts, notarized documents and the
notarial register.  By her own admission
she has assigned to complainant Sambo duties she was supposed to perform, yet
according to her she never bother(ed) to check the notarial register of the
court to find out the number of documents notarized in a month (TSN, p. 30;
11-23-93).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Assuming that respondent Baroy assigned the preparation of the
monthly report of cases to Sambo, which was denied by the latter as he claims
that he only typed the monthly report based on the data given to him by her,
still it is her duty to verify and check whether the report is correct.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The explanation of respondent Baroy that Sambo was the one in custody
of marriage contracts, notarized documents and notarial register, among other
things, is not acceptable not only because as clerk of court she was supposed
to be in custody, control and supervision of all court records including
documents and other properties of the court (p. 32, Manual for Clerks of
Court), but she herself admitted that from January, 1992 she was already in
full control of all the records of the court including receipts (TSN, p. 11;
11-23-93).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence adduced in this case in connection with the charge of
falsification, however, also shows that respondent Baroy did not account for
what happened to the notarial fees received for those documents notarized
during the month of July and September, 1992.  The evidence adduced in this case also sufficiently show that she
received cash bond deposits and she did not deposit them to a bank or to the
Municipal Treasurer; and that she only issued temporary receipts for said cash
bond deposits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For July, 1992 there were only six (6) documents reported to have
been notarized by Judge Palaypayon although the documents notarized for said
month were actually one hundred thirteen (113) as recorded in the notarial
register.  For September, 1992, there
were only five (5) documents reported as notarized for that month, though the
notarial register show(s) that there were fifty-six (56) documents actually
notarized.  The fee for each document
notarized as appearing in the notarial register was P18.50.  Respondent Baroy and Sambo declared that
what was actually being charged was P20.00.  Respondent Baroy declared that P18.50 went to the Supreme Court and
P1.50 was being turned over to the Municipal Treasurer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Baroy, however, did not present any evidence to show that she
really sent to the Supreme Court the notarial fees of P18.50 for each document
notarized and to the Municipal Treasurer the additional notarial fee of
P1.50.  This should be fully accounted
for considering that Baroy herself declared that some notarial fees were
allowed by her at her own discretion to be paid later.  Similarly, the solemnization fees have not
been accounted for by Baroy considering that she admitted that even (i)n those
instances where the marriages were not solemnized due to lack of marriage
license the solemnization fees were not returned anymore, unless the
contracting parties made a demand for their return.  Judge Palaypayon declared that he did not know of any instance
when solemnization fee was returned when the marriage was not solemnized due to
lack of marriage license.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Baroy also claims that Ramon Sambo did not turn over to
her some of the notarial fees.  This is
difficult to believe.  It was not only
because Sambo vehemently denied it, but the minutes of the conference of the
personnel of the MTC of Tinambac dated January 20, 1992 shows that on that date
Baroy informed the personnel of the court that she was taking over the
functions she assigned to Sambo, particularly the collection of legal fees
(Exh. 7).  The notarial fees she claims
that Sambo did not turn over to her were for those documents notarized (i)n
July and September, 1992 already.  Besides there never was any demand she made for Sambo to turn over some
notarial fees supposedly in his possession.  Neither was there any memorandum she issued on this matter, in spite of
the fact that she has been holding meetings and issuing memoranda to the
personnel of the court (Exhs. V, W, FF, FF-1, FF-2, FF-3; Exhs. 4-A
(supplement(s), 5-8, 6-S, 7-S and 8-S).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is admitted by respondent Baroy that on October 29, 1991 a cash
bond deposit of a certain Dacara in the amount of One Thousand (P1,000.00)
Pesos was turned over to her after she assumed office and for this cash bond
she issued only a temporary receipt (Exh. Y).  She did not deposit this cash bond in any bank or to the Municipal
Treasurer.  She just kept it in her own
cash box on the alleged ground that the parties in that case where the cash
bond was deposited informed her that they would settle the case amicably.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Baroy declared that she finally deposited the
aforementioned cash bond of One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos with the Land Bank
of the Philippines (LBP) in February, 1993, after this administrative case was
already filed (TSN, pp. 27-28; 12-22-93).  The Pass Book, however, shows that actually Baroy opened an account with
the LBP, Naga Branch, only on March 26, 1993 when she deposited an amount of
Two Thousand (P2,000.00) Pesos (Exhs. 8 to 8-1-a).  She claims that One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos of the initial
deposit was the cash bond of Dacara.  If
it were true, it was only after keeping to herself the cash bond of One
Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos for around one year and five months when she finally
deposited it because of the filing of this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 29, 1993, or only one month and two days after she finally
deposited the One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos cash bond of Dacara, she withdrew
it from the bank without any authority or order from the court.  It was only on July 23, 1993, or after
almost three (3) months after she withdrew it, when she redeposited said cash
bond (TSN, p. 6; 1-4-94).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence presented in this case also show that on February 28,
1993 respondent Baroy received also a cash bond of Three Thousand (P3,000.00)
Pesos from a certain Alfredo Seprones in Crim. Case No. 5180.  For this cash bond deposit, respondent Baroy
issued only an annumbered temporary receipt (Exh. X and X-1).  Again Baroy just kept this Three Thousand
(P3,000.00) Pesos cash bond to herself.  She did not deposit it either (in) a bank or (with) the Municipal
Treasurer.  Her explanation was that the
parties in Crim. Case No. 5180 informed her that they would settle the case
amicably.  It was on April 26, 1993, or
almost two months later when Judge Palaypayon issued an order for the release
of said cash bond (Exh. 7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Baroy also admitted that since she assumed office on
October 21, 1991 she used to issue temporary receipt only for cash bond
deposits and other payments and collections she received.  She further admitted that some of these
temporary receipts she issued she failed to place the number of the receipts
such as that receipt marked Exhibit X (TSN, p. 35; 11-23-93).  Baroy claims that she did not know that she
had to use the official receipts of the Supreme Court.  It was only from February, 1993, after this
case was already filed, when she only started issuing official receipts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The next charge against the respondents is that in order to be
appointed Clerk of Court, Baroy gave Judge Palaypayon an air conditioner as a
gift.  The evidence adduced with respect
to this charge, show that on August 24, 1991 Baroy bought an air conditioner
for the sum of Seventeen Thousand Six Hundred (P17,600.00) Pesos (Exhs. I and
I-1).  The same was paid partly in cash
and in check (Exhs. I-2 and I-3).  When
the air conditioner was brought to court in order to be installed in the
chamber of Judge Palaypayon, it was still placed in the same box when it was
bought and was not used yet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondents claim that Baroy sold it to Judge Palaypayon for
Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) Pesos on installment basis with a down payment of
Five Thousand (P5,000.00) Pesos and as proof thereof the respondents presented
a typewritten receipt dated May 29, 1993 (Exh. 22).  The receipt was signed by both respondents and by the Municipal
Mayor of Tinambac, Camarines Sur and another person as witness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The alleged sale between respondents is not beyond suspicion.  It was bought by Baroy at a time when she
was applying for the vacant position of Clerk of Court (to) which she was
eventually appointed in October, 1991.  From the time she bought the air conditioner on August 24, 1991 until it
was installed in the office of Judge Palaypayon it was not used yet.  The sale to Judge Palaypayon was only
evidenced by a mere typewritten receipt dated May 29, 1992 when this case was
already filed.  The receipt could have
been easily prepared.  The Municipal
Mayor of Tinambac who signed in the receipt as a witness did not testify in
this case.  The sale is between the
Clerk of Court and the Judge of the same court.  All these circumstances give rise to suspicion of at least
impropriety.  Judges should avoid such
action as would subject (them) to suspicion and (their) conduct should be free
from the appearance of impropriety (Jaagueta vs. Boncasos, 60 SCRA 27).</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to the charge that Judge Palaypayon received a cash
bond deposit of One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos from Januaria Dacara without
issuing a receipt, Dacara executed an affidavit regarding this charge that
Judge Palaypayon did not give her a receipt for the P1,000.00 cash bond she
deposited (Exh. N).  Her affidavit,
however, has no probative value as she did not show that this cash bond of
P1,000.00 found its way into the hands of respondent Baroy who issued only a
temporary receipt for it and this has been discussed earlier.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another charge against Judge Palaypayon is the getting of detention
prisoners to work in his house and one of them escaped while in his custody and
was never found again.  To hide this
fact, the case against said accused was ordered archived by Judge
Palaypayon.  The evidence adduced with
respect to this particular charge, show that in Crim. Case No. 5647 entitled
People vs. Stephen Kalaw, Alex Alano and Allan Adupe, accused Alex Alano and
Allan Adupe were arrested on april 12, 1991 and placed in the municipal jail of
Tinambac, Camarines sur (Exhs. O, 0-1, 0-2 and 0-3; Exh. 25).  The evidence presented that Alex Alano was
taken by Judge Palaypayon from the municipal jail where said accused was
confined and that he escaped while in custody of Judge Palaypayon is solely
testimonial, particularly that of David Ortiz, a former utility worker of the
MTC of Tinambac.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Herein investigator finds said evidence not sufficient.  The complainants should have presented
records from the police of Tinambac to show that Judge Palaypayon took out from
the municipal jail Alex Alano where he was under detention and said accused
escaped while in the custody of Judge Palaypayon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The order, however, of Judge Palaypayon dated April 6, 1992 in Crim.
Case No. 5047 archiving said case appears to be without basis.  The order states:  “This case was filed on April 12, 1991 and the records show that
the warrant of arrest (was) issued against the accused, but up to this moment
there is no return of service for the warrant of arrest issued against said
accused” (Exh. 0-4).  The records of
said case, however, show that in fact there was a return of the service of the
warrant of arrest dated April 12, 1991 showing that Alano and Adupe were
arrested (Exh. 0-3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon explained that his order dated April 6, 1992
archiving Crim. Case No. 5047 referred only to one of the accused who remained
at large.  The explanation cannot be
accepted because the two other accused, Alano and Adupe, were arrested.  Judge Palaypayon should have issued an order
for the arrest of Adupe who allegedly jumped bail, but Alano was supposed to be
confined in the municipal jail if his claim is true that he did not take
custody of Alano.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The explanation also of Judge Palaypayon why he ordered the case
archived was because he heard from the police that Alano escaped.  This explanation is not acceptable
either.  He should ha(ve) set the case
and if the police failed to bring to court Alano, the former should have been
required to explain in writing why Alano was not brought to court.  If the explanation was that Alano escaped
from jail, he should have issued an order for his arrest.  It is only later on when he could not be
arrested when the case should have been ordered archived.  The order archiving this case for the reason
that he only heard that Alano escaped is another circumstance which gave rise
to a suspicion that Alano might have really escaped while in his custody only
that the complainants could not present records or other documentary evidence
to prove the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The last charge against the respondents is that they collected
filing fees on collection cases filed by the Rural Bank of Tinambac, Camarines
Sur which was supposed to be exempted in paying filing fees under existing laws
and that the filing fees received was deposited by respondent Baroy in her
personal account in the bank.  The
evidence presented show that on February 4, 1992 the Rural Bank of Tinambac
filed ten (10) civil cases for collection against farmers and it paid the total
amount of Four Hundred (P400.00) Pesos representing filing fees.  The complainants cited Section 14 of
Republic Act 720, as amended, which exempts Rural Banks (from) the payment of
filing fees on collection of sums of money cases filed against farmers on loans
they obtained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon, however, had nothing to do with the payment of
the filing fees of the Rural Bank of Tinambac as it was respondent Baroy who
received them and besides, on February 4, 1992, he was on sick leave.  On her part Baroy claims that the bank paid
voluntarily the filing fees.  The
records, however, show that respondent Baroy sent a letter to the manager of
the bank dated January 28, 1992 to the effect that if the bank would not pay
she would submit all Rural Bank cases for dismissal (Annex 6, comment by
respondent Baroy).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Baroy should have checked whether the Rural Bank of
Tinambac was really exempt from the payment of filing fees pursuant to Republic
Act 720, as amended, instead of threatening the bank to have its cases be
submitted to the court in order to have them dismissed.  Here the payment of the filing fees was made
on February 4, 1992, but the Four Hundred (P400.00) Pesos was only turned over
to the Municipal Treasurer on March 12, 1992.  Here, there is an undue delay again in complying with her obligation as
accountable officer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view of the foregoing findings that the evidence presented by
the complainants sufficiently show that respondent Judge Lucio P. Palaypayon,
Jr. had solemnized marriages, particularly that of Sammy Bocaya and Gina
Besmonte, without a marriage license, and that it having been shown that he did
not comply with his duty in closely supervising his clerk of court in the
preparation of the monthly report of cases being submitted to the Supreme
Court, particularly for the months of July and September, 1992 where it has
been proven that the reports for said two (2) months were falsified with
respect to the number of documents notarized, it is respectfully recommended
that he be imposed a fine of TEN THOUSAND (P10,000.00) PESOS with a warning
that the same or similar offenses will be more severely dealt with.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that Judge Palaypayon did not sign the marriage contracts or
certificates of those marriages he solemnized without a marriage license, there
were no dates placed in the marriage contracts to show when they were
solemnized, the contracting parties were not furnished their marriage contracts
and the Local Civil Registrar was not being sent any copy of the marriage
contract, will not absolve him from liability.  By solemnizing alone a marriage without a marriage license he as the
solemnizing officer is the one responsible for the irregularity in not
complying (with) the formal requ(i)sites of marriage and under Article 4(3) of
the Family Code of the Philippines, he shall be civilly, criminally and
administratively liable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judge Palaypayon is likewise liable for his negligence or failure
to comply with his duty of closely supervising his clerk of court in the
performance of the latter’s duties and functions, particularly the preparation
of the monthly report of cases (Bendesula vs. Laya, 58 SCRA 16).  His explanation tht he only signed the
monthly report of cases only when his clerk of court already signed the same,
cannot be accepted.  It is his duty to
closely supervise her, to check and verify the records if the monthly reports
prepared by his clerk of court do not contain false statements.  It was held that “A judge cannot take refuge
behind the inefficiency or incompetence of court personnel (Nidua vs. Lazaro,
174 SCRA 158).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view also of the foregoing finding that respondent Nelia
Esmeralda-Baroy, the clerk of court of the Municipal Trial Court of Tinambac,
Camarines Sur, has been found to have falsified the monthly report of cases for
the months of July and September, 1992 with respect to the number of documents
notarized, for having failed to account (for) the notarial fees she received
for said two (2) months period; for having failed to account (for) the
solemnization fees of those marriages allegedly not solemnized, but the
solemnization fees were not returned; for unauthorized issuance of temporary
receipts, some of which were issued unnumbered; for receiving the cash bond of
Dacara on October 29, 1991 in the amount of One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos for
which she issued only a temporary receipt (Exh. Y) and for depositing it with
the Land Bank of the Philippines only on March 26, 1993, or after one year and
five months in her possession and after this case was already filed; for
withdrawing said cash bond of One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos on April 29, 1993
without any court order or authority and redepositing it only on July 23, 1993;
for receiving a cash bond of Three Thousand (P3,000.00) Pesos from Alfredo
Seprones in Crim. Case No. 5180, MTC, Tinambac, Camarines Sur, for which she
issued only an unnumbered temporary receipt (Exhs. X and X-1) and for not
depositing it with a bank or with the Municipal Treasurer until it was ordered
released; and for requiring the Rural Bank of Tinambac, Camarines Sur to pay
filing fees on February 4, 1992 for collection cases filed against farmers in
the amount of Four Hundred (P400.00) Pesos, but turning over said amount to the
Municipal Treasurer only on March 12, 1992, it is respectfully recommended that
said respondent clerk of court Nelia Esmeralda-Baroy be dismissed from the
service.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is provided that “Withdrawal of court deposits shall be by the
clerk of court who shall issue official receipt to the provincial, city or
municipal treasurer for the amount withdrawn.  Court deposits cannot be withdrawn except by order of the court, x x x.”
(Revised Manual of Instructions for Treasurers, Sec. 183, 184 and 626; p. 127,
Manual for Clerks of Court).  A circular
also provides that the Clerks of Court shall immediately issue an official
receipt upon receipt of deposits from party litigants and thereafter deposit
intact the collection with the municipal, city or provincial treasurer and
their deposits can only be withdrawn upon proper receipt and order of the court
(DOJ Circular No. 52, 26 April 1968; p. 136, Manual for Clerks of Court).  Supreme Court Memorandum Circular No. 5, 25
November 1982, also provides that “all collections of funds of fiduciary
character including rental deposits, shall be deposited immediately by the
clerk of court concerned upon receipt thereof with City, Municipal or
Provincial Treasurer where his court is located” and that “no withdrawal of any
of such deposits shall be made except upon lawful order of the court exercising
jurisdiction over the subject matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Baroy had either failed to comply with the foregoing
circulars, or deliberately disregarded, or even intentionally violated
them.  By her conduct, she demonstrated
her callous unconcern for the obligations and responsibility of her duties and
functions as a clerk of court and accountable officer.  The gross neglect of her duties shown by her
constitute(s) a serious misconduct which warrant(s) her removal from
office.  In the case of Belen P.
Ferriola vs. Norma Hiam, Clerk of Court, MTCC, Branch I, Batangas City; A.M.
No. P-90-414; August 9, 1993, it was held that “The clerk of court is not
authorized to keep funds in his/her custody; monies received by him/her shall
be deposited immediately upon receipt thereof with the City, Municipal or
Provincial Treasurer.  Supreme Court
Circular Nos. 5 dated November 25, 1982 and 5-A dated December 3, 1982.  Respondent Hiam’s failure to remit the cash
bail bonds and fine she collected constitutes serious misconduct and her
misappropriation of said funds constitutes dishonesty.  “Respondent Norma Hiam was found guilty of
dishonesty and serious misconduct prejudicial to the best interest of the
service and (the Court) ordered her immediate dismissal (from) the service.</blockquote>
