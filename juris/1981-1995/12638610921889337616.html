<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> was admitted
to the Philippine Airlines (PAL) <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">aviation</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place> for training as a pilot
beginning <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="1">16 January 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The training agreement bound PAL to provide
regular and permanent employment to <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> upon
completion of the training course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="25" month="1">25 January 1974</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span>
completed the course, and undertook an equipment qualification course up to <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="10">4 October 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="10">9
 October 1974</st1:date>, the Civil Aeronautics Administration issued him a
license as Commercial Pilot and PAL then extended him a temporary appointment
for six (6) months as Limited First Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When his appointment was due to expire on 30 April 1975, <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> had only logged eighty four (84) hours and fifty five
(55) minutes flying time, short of the minimum 500 flying hours required for
regularization as First Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
enable him to complete the requirement, his employment was extended for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">another <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

when his appointment was again due to expire, he was still short of the minimum
flying time requirement such that his appointment was again extended up to 30
April 1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During this third extension
of his appointment, <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> completed the 500 flying
hours requirement, and thus on 31 March 1976 he applied for regularization as
First Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pending his physical

"J" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 85.] On <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="3">23 March 1979</st1:date>, the Labor Arbiter

there is merit on the application for clearance, and therefore, the same should

appealed the Labor Arbiter's decision to the public respondent NLRC on <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="4">29 April 1979</st1:date> and there filed a
motion praying that PAL be ordered to return him to <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>
payroll, contending that the Labor Arbiter's decision was not yet final because
of his timely appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PAL opposed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>motion claiming that it was no
longer obliged to return <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> to its payroll since

Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, <span class="GramE">this petition, with a prayer for a
temporary restraining order</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court issued a temporary restraining order on <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="10">10 October 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> failed to file his
comment and the Solicitor General submitted his own Comment supporting the
stand of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to the adverse
stand of the Solicitor General, public respondent NLRC submitted its own
Comment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue before the Court is whether or not the NLRC committed
grave abuse of discretion in holding that private respondent <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> was entitled to his salaries from <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="4">1 April 1979</st1:date> "until this case is
finally resolved."</p>

<p class="BODY">PAL contends that inasmuch as the respondent Commission acting <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> had affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the
decision of the Labor Arbiter granting petitioner the clearance for the
dismissal of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span>, it is an act
of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction on its part to
order petitioner to pay private respondent's salaries from 1 April 1979 until
the case is finally terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PAL
contends that said stipulation refers only to the resolution of the case by
arbitration and said arbitration of the case was terminated when the Labor
Arbiter rendered its decision dated <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="3">23
 March 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PAL argues that
the arbitration of the case is limited to and comprises merely the proceedings
before the Labor Arbiter such that when the latter renders a decision,
arbitration of the dispute is terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent NLRC on the other hand contends that
arbitration is a continuing process from the time the case is referred by the
Secretary of Labor to the Arbitration Branch until the final judgment is had on
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the Labor Arbiter's
decision in favor of petitioner did not finally resolve the case in view of the
timely appeal by private respondent from said decision, the case was not yet
finally terminated by arbitration and <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> is
entitled to be placed in petitioner's payroll until the complaint is finally
resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above contentions call for the proper interpretation of the
agreement between the parties, specifically the third stipulation containing
the clause "pending final resolution of the case by arbitration."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a basic rule in interpretation of contracts that the
circumstances under which an instrument was made, including the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> situation</span> of the subject thereof and
the parties to it, may be considered so that the intention of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">contracting parties may be </span>judged
correctly [Art. 1371, Civil Code of the Philippines; Section 11, Rule 130,
Rules of Court; Lim v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-40258, </span><st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 11, 1980</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 99 SCRA 668.]</span> In the instant case, the stipulation in the <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="3">2 March 1977</st1:date> agreement that <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> shall be included in the payroll of PAL until final
resolution of the case by arbitration was intended to supersede the order of
the Regional Director which, by stipulation of the parties, was rendered moot
and academic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In lieu of reinstatement
and the payment of his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, private respondent
was included in petitioner's <span class="GramE">payroll,</span> effective from
the time he was preventively suspended until final resolution of the case by
arbitration, without having to perform any work for the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In entering into the agreement, the parties
could not have intended to include in the clause "final resolution of the
case by arbitration" the whole adjudicatory process, including
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For if it were so, even
proceedings on <i>certiorari</i> before this Court would be embraced by the
term "arbitration" and private respondent will continue to receive
monthly salary without rendering any service to the petitioner regardless of
the outcome of the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter, for as long as one of
the parties appeal to the NLRC and until the case is finally resolved by this
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is clearly an absurdity
which could not have been contemplated by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can proceedings on appeal before the NLRC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
be considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>part of the
arbitration proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its broad
sense, arbitration is the reference of a dispute to an impartial third person,
chosen by the parties or appointed by statutory authority to hear and decide
the case in controversy [Chan <span class="SpellE">Linte</span> v. Law Union and
Rock, Ins. Co., 42 Phil. 548 (1921).] When the consent of one of the parties is
enforced by statutory provisions, the proceeding is referred to as compulsory
arbitration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In labor cases, compulsory
arbitration is the process of settlement of labor disputes by a government
agency which has the authority to investigate and to make an award which is
binding on all the parties [<u>See</u> Wood v. Seattle, 23 Wash. 1, 62 P 135,
52 LRA 369 (1920); Amalgamated Association v. Wisconsin Employees' Relations
Board, 340 U.S. 383-410, 95 L. Ed. 381 (1951).] Under the Labor Code, it is the
Labor Arbiter who is clothed with the authority to conduct compulsory
arbitration on cases involving termination disputes [Article 217, Pres. Decree
No. 442, as amended.] When the Labor Arbiter renders his decision, compulsory
arbitration is deemed terminated because by then the hearing and determination
of the controversy has ended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any appeal
raised by an aggrieved party from the Labor Arbiter's decision is already
beyond the scope of arbitration since in the appeal <span class="GramE">stage,</span>
the NLRC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> merely reviews the Labor Arbiter's decision for
errors of fact or law and no longer duplicates the proceedings before the Labor
Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the clause "pending
final resolution of the case by arbitration" should be understood to be
limited only to the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter, such that when the latter
rendered his decision, the case was finally resolved by arbitration.</p>

<p class="BODY">More important, however, is the fact that the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
order for the continued payment of <span class="SpellE">Dolina's</span> salaries
is inconsistent with its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the Labor
Arbiter's decision upholding the validity of <span class="SpellE">Dolina's</span>
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In affirming the Labor
Arbiter's decision granting the termination clearance, the NLRC held that:</p>

<blockquote>With respect to the issue of whether or not the complainant's [<span class="SpellE">Dolina</span>] dismissal was sufficiently grounded, we are not
persuaded that the respondent [herein petitioner PAL] is under obligation to
employ him as regular employee simply because he was certified physically fit
and technically proficient by the CAA.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>This is understandable for it concerns the safety of its
properties, and above all, the safety of the lives and properties of its
passengers, which by law it is committed to transport safely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence, therefore, of any showing
that its standards are unreasonable and discriminatory, which we do not find
here, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot disturb them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We can only say that for exercising
extraordinary diligence in the selection of its pilots, <span class="GramE">We</span>
join the public in commending it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In fine, it is <span class="GramE">Our</span> considered view that
the respondent's application for clearance to dismiss the complainant has
sufficiently surmounted the test of validity.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the above finding of valid dismissal, the NLRC had no
authority to order the continued payment of <span class="SpellE">Dolina's</span>
salaries from <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="4">1 April 1979</st1:date>
until the case is finally resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> order would result in compensating <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> for services no longer rendered and when he is no
longer in <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span> employ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is contrary to the age-old rule of
"a fair day's wage for <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a fair
day's </span>labor" which continues to govern the relation between labor
and capital and remains <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>basic
factor in determining employees' wages [<span class="SpellE">Durabilt</span>
Recapping Plant &amp; Co. v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No.

the employee there can be no wage or pay unless the laborer was able, willing
and ready to work but was prevented by management or was illegally locked out,
suspended or dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the
employee's dismissal was for <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>just
cause, it would neither be fair nor just to allow the employee to recover
something he has not earned and could not have earned [Santos v. National Labor
Relations Commission, G.R. No. 76721, September 21, 1987, 154 SCRA 166.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in ordering the continued payment of <span class="SpellE">Dolina's</span> salaries from <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="4">1 April 1979</st1:date> until the case is finally resolved, the NLRC
in effect ordered the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to <span class="SpellE">Dolina</span> notwithstanding its finding of a valid dismissal.</p>
