				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of
Appeals dismissing the complaint for damages filed by the petitioner against
the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was hired to teach during the 1981-82 school year
in the Immaculate Concepcion Institute in the Island of Camotes.  On January 13, 1982, or before the school
year ended, she applied for an indefinite leave of absence because her daughter
was taking her to Austria where her daughter was employed (Exh. B).  The application was recommended for approval
by the school principal, Emerito O. Labajo, and approved by the President of
the school's Board of Directors (Exh. B-1).</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 1, 1982, Emerito Labajo addressed a letter to the
petitioner through her husband, Sotero Garciano (for she was still abroad),
informing her of the decision of Fr. Joseph Wiertz, the school's founder,
concurred in by the president of the Parent-Teachers Association and the school
faculty, to terminate her services as a member of the teaching staff because
of:  (1) the absence of any written
contract of employment between her and the school due to her refusal to sign
one; and (2) the difficulty of getting a substitute for her on a temporary
basis as no one would accept the position without a written contract (Exhs. C
and 1).  Upon her return from Austria in
the later part of June, 1982, she received the letter informing her that her
services at the Immaculate Concepcion Institute had been terminated.  She made inquiries from the school about the
matter and, on July 7, 1982, the members of the Board of Directors of the
school, with the exception of Fr. Joseph Wiertz, signed a letter notifying her
that she was "reinstated to report and do your usual duties as Classroom
Teacher . . . effective July 5, 1982," and that "any letter or notice
of termination received by you before this date has no sanction or authority by
the Board of Directors of this Institution, therefore it is declared null and
void x x x" (Exhs. D and 2).</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 9, 1982, the president, vice president, secretary, and
three members of the Board of Directors, out of a membership of nine (9),
resigned their positions from the Board "for the reason that the ICI
Faculty, has reacted acidly to the Board's deliberations for the reinstatement
of Mrs. Esteria F. Garciano, thereby questioning the integrity of the Board's
decision" (Exh. E).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 3, 1982, petitioner filed a complaint for damages in
the Regional Trial Court, Cebu, Branch XI, against Fr. Wiertz, Emerito Labajo,
and some members of the faculty of the school for discrimination and unjust and
illegal dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered a decision on August 30,
1985, ordering the defendants jointly and severally to pay her P200,000 as
moral damages, P50,000 as exemplary damages, P32,400 as lost earnings for nine
years, and P10,000 as litigation expenses and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants (now private respondents) appealed to the Court of
Appeals (CA-G.R. CV No. 10692), which on August 30, 1990 reversed the trial
court's decision thus:</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is reversed, the
complaint is dismissed, and defendants-appellants are absolved from any
liability to plaintiff?appellee.  With costs against plaintiff-appellee." (p. 13, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff-appellee (now petitioner) filed a motion for
reconsideration which the Court of Appeals denied on October 26, 1990.  Hence, this petition for review wherein the
lone error assigned by petitioner reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Respondent Court of Appeals gravely erred in absolving the
private respondents from liability by faulting the petitioner for her failure
to report back to her work." (p. 6, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful perusal of the petition and the respondents' comments,
the Court resolved to deny the petition for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The board of directors of the Immaculate Concepcion Institute,
which alone possesses the authority to hire and fire teachers and other
employees <span style="">of the school, did not
dismiss the petitioner.  It in fact
directed her to report for work.  While
the private respondents sent her a letter of termination through her husband,
they admittedly had no authority to do so.  As the Court of Appeals aptly observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"We agree with defendants?appellants, however, that they
should not have been held liable to plaintiff-appellee for damages.  Defendants-appellants had no authority to
dismiss plaintiff?appellee and the latter was aware of this.  Hence, the letter of termination sent to her
through her husband (Exhs. C and 1) by defendants-appellants had no legal
effect whatsoever.  It did not
effectively prevent her from reporting for work.  What is more, it was subsequently repudiated by the Board of
Directors which directed her to report for work.  (Exhs. D and 2) There was, therefore, no reason why she did not
continue with her teaching in the school.  No evidence had been presented to show that defendants-appellants
prevented her from reporting for work.  The fact that defendants-appellants had 'acidly' received the action of
the Board of Directors repudiating their decision to terminate
plaintiff-appellee is not proof that defendants-appellants<span style=""> </span>had effectively and physically
prevented plaintiff-appellee from resuming her post.  It was nothing more than a reaction to what defendants-appellants
perceived as an affront to their collective prestige.  It would appear, therefore, that plaintiff-appellee had
voluntarily desisted from her teaching job in the school and has no right to
recover damages from defendants-appellants." (p. 13, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Liability for damages under Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the Civil
Code arises only from unlawful, willful or negligent acts that are contrary to
law, or morals, good customs or public policy.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Art. 19.  Every person
must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act
with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Art. 20.  Every person
who, contrary to law, willfully or negligently causes damage to another, shall
indemnify the latter for the same.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Art. 21.  Any person
who willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to
morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the
damage."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals was correct in finding that petitioner's
discontinuance from teaching was her own choice.  While the respondents admittedly wanted her service terminated,
they actually did nothing to physically prevent her from reassuming her post,
as ordered by the school's Board of Directors.  That the school principal and Fr. Wiertz disagreed with the Board's
decision to retain her, and some teachers allegedly threatened to resign <u>en</u>
<u>masse</u>, even if true, did not make them liable to her for damages.  They were simply exercising their right of
free speech or their right to dissent from the Board's decision.  Their acts were not contrary to law, morals,
good customs or public policy.  They did
not "illegally dismiss" her for the Board's decision to retain her
prevailed.  She was ordered to report
for work on July 5, 1982, but she did not comply with that order.  Consequently, whatever loss she may have
incurred in the form of lost earnings was self-inflicted.  <u><span style="">Volenti</span></u>
<u>non</u> <u>fit</u> <u><span style="">injuria</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to petitioner's claim for moral damages, the right
to recover them under Article 21 is based on equity, and he who comes to court
to demand equity, must come with clean hands.  Article 21 should be construed as granting the right to recover damages
to injured persons who are not themselves at fault (Mabutas vs. Calapan
Electric Co. [CA] 50 OG 5828, cited in Padilla, Civil Code Annotated, Vol. 1,
1975 Ed., p. 87).  Moral damages are
recoverable only if the case falls under Article 2219 in relation to Article 21
(Flordelis vs. Mar, 114 SCRA 41).  In
the case at bar, petitioner is not without fault.  Firstly, she went on an indefinite leave of absence and failed to
report back in time for the regular opening of classes.  Secondly, for reasons known to herself
alone, she refused to sign a written contract of employment.   Lastly, she ignored the <span style="">Board of Directors' order for her to report
for duty on July 5, 1982.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's award of exemplary damages to her was not
justified for she is not entitled to moral, temperate or compensatory damages
(Art. 2234, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the Court of Appeals correctly set aside the damages
awarded by the trial court to the petitioner for they did not have any legal or
factual basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit and
the decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>

Bellosillo, JJ.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.</span></span><br>
