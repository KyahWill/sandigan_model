</span>However, she averred that Tee had been operating the said truck in </span><st1:place><span style="">Central Luzon</span></st1:place><span style=""> from that date (</span><st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="2"><span style="">28 February 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">) onwards, and that, therefore, <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span> was Tee's employee and not hers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1985" day="30" month="1"><span style="">30

the trial court, the appellate court held that since petitioner was the
registered owner of the subject vehicle, <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span>, the
driver of the truck, was her <span class="GramE">employee,</span> and that
accordingly petitioner should be responsible for the negligence of said driver
and bear the loss of the sawn lumber plus damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved for reconsideration, without
success.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the present Petition
for Review, the sole issue raised is whether or not under the facts and
applicable law, the appellate court was correct in finding that petitioner,
being the registered owner of the carrier, should be held liable for the value of
the undelivered </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">lost sawn lumber.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner urges that she
could not be held answerable for the loss of the cargo, because the doctrine
which makes the registered owner of a common carrier vehicle answerable to the
public for the negligence of the driver despite the sale of the vehicle to
another person, applies only to cases involving death of or injury to
passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What applies in the present
case, according to petitioner, is the rule that a contract of carriage requires
proper delivery of the goods to and acceptance by the carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, petitioner contends that the delivery
to a person falsely representing <span class="GramE">himself</span> to be an
agent of the carrier prevents liability from attaching to the registered owner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court considers that
petitioner has failed to show that appellate court committed reversible error
in affirming the trial court's holding that petitioner was liable for the cost
of the sawn lumber </span><span style="">plus </span><span style="">damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no dispute that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> has been </span>holding herself
out to the public as engaged in the business of hauling or transporting goods
for hire or compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> is, in brief, a common carrier.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prevailing doctrine
on common carriers makes the registered owner liable for consequences flowing
from the </span>operations of the carrier, even though the specific vehicle<span style=""> involved may already have been transferred
to another person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This doctrine rests
upon the principle that </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">dealing with vehicles registered under the
Public Service Law, the public has the right to assume that the registered
owner is the actual or lawful owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be very difficult and often impossible as a practical matter,
for members of the general public to enforce the rights of action that they may
have for injuries inflicted by </span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">vehicles being negligently
operated if they should be </span>required <span style="">to prove who the actual owner is.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The </span>registered owner is not allowed
to deny liability by proving the identity of the alleged transferee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, contrary to petitioner's claim, private
respondent is not required to go beyond the vehicle's certificate of
registration to ascertain the owner of the carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, the letter presented by
petitioner allegedly written by Benjamin Tee admitting that <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span>
was his driver, had no evidentiary value not only because Benjamin Tee was not
presented in court to testify on this matter but also because of the
aforementioned doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To permit the
ostensible or registered owner to prove who the actual owner <span class="GramE">is,</span>
would be to set at naught the purpose or public policy which infuses that
doctrine.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In fact, private
respondent had no reason at all to doubt the authority of <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span>
to enter into a contract of carriage on behalf of the registered owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that, earlier, in the first week
of May 1980, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Greenhills</span> had
contracted <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span> who was then driving the same
cargo truck to transport and carry a load of sawn lumber from the <span class="SpellE">Maddella</span> sawmill to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dagupan</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> No </span><span style="">one came forward to question that contract or the authority of <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span> to represent the owner of the carrier truck.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, assuming the
truth of her story, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> retained
registered ownership of the freight truck for her own benefit and convenience,
that is, to secure the payment of the balance of the selling price of the
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She may have been unaware of the
legal security device of chattel mortgage; or she, or her buyer, may have been
unwilling to absorb the expenses of registering a chattel mortgage over the
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In either case, considerations
both of public policy and of equity require that she bear the consequences
flowing from registered ownership of the subject vehicle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, however, insists
that the said principle should apply only to cases involving negligence and
resulting injury to or death of passengers, and not to cases involving merely
carriage of goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">A common carrier, both from the nature of its business and for
insistent reasons of public policy, is burdened by the law with the duty of
exercising extraordinary diligence not only in ensuring the safety of <u>passengers</u>
but also in caring for <u>goods</u> transported by it.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The loss or destruction or deterioration of goods turned over to the common
carrier for conveyance to a designated destination, raises instantly a
presumption of fault or negligence on the part of the carrier, save only where
such loss, destruction or damage arises from extreme circumstances such as a
natural disaster or calamity or act of the public enemy in <span style="">time of war, or from an act or omission of
the shipper himself or from the character of the goods or their packaging or
container.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This presumption may be overcome only by proof of extraordinary
diligence on the part of the carrier.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly, to permit <span style="">a </span>common
carrier to escape its responsibi­lity for the passengers or goods transported
by it by proving a prior sale of the vehicle or means of transport­ation to an
alleged vendee would be to attenuate drastically the carrier's duty of
extraordinary diligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would also
open wide the door to collusion between the carrier and the supposed vendee and
to shifting liability from the <span style="">carrier </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">one without financial capability to respond for the resulting
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the thrust of
the public policy here involved </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">as sharp and real in the case of
carriage of goods as it is in the transporting of human beings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, to sustain petitioner <span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> contention, that is, to require the shipper to
go behind a certificate of registration of a public utility vehicle, would be
utterly subversive of the purpose of the law and doctrine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further insists that there was no perfected contract
of carriage for the reason that there was no proof that her consent or that of
Tee had been obtained; no proof that the driver, <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span>,
was authorized to bind the registered owner; and no proof that the parties had
agreed on the freightage to be paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once more, we are not persuaded by petitioner's arguments which
appear to be a transparent attempt to evade statutory responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Driver <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span> was
entrusted with possession and control of the freight truck by the registered
owner (and by the alleged secret owner, for that matter).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Driver <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span>,
under the circumstances, was clothed with at least implied authority to
contract to carry goods and to accept delivery of such goods for carriage to <span style="">a </span>specified destination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the freight to be paid may not have been
fixed before loading and <span class="GramE">carriage,</span> did not prevent the
contract of carriage from arising, since the freight was at least determinable
if not fixed by the tariff schedules in petitioner's main business office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Put in somewhat different terms, driver <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span> is in law regarded as the employee and agent of the
petitioner, for whose acts petitioner must respond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contract of carriage of goods was shown;
the sawn lumber was loaded on board the freight truck; loss or non-delivery of
the lumber at Blue Star's premises in Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
was also proven; and petitioner has not proven either that she had exercised
extraordinary diligence to prevent such loss or non-delivery or that the loss
or non-delivery was due to some casualty or <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>
inconsistent with her liability.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner's liability to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Greenhills</span>
was thus fixed and complete, without prejudice to petitioner's right to proceed
against her putative transferee Benjamin Tee and driver <span class="SpellE">Licuden</span>
for reimbursement or contribu<span style="">tion.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
