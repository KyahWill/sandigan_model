				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">May a sheriff's sale on execution of properties of a judgment
debtor be set aside after the period of redemption had expired on the ground
that either the properties are exempt from execution or that their value is
grossly in excess of the judgment debt and costs, thereby resulting in an
iniquitous transaction amounting to a deprivation of property without due
process of law?</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the principal issue in this case which was spawned by the
trial court<span style="">'</span>s denial of a motion
to set aside an execution sale filed six (6) months after the lapse of the
one-year redemption period.  The denial
order was appealed to the Court of Appeals.  However, on 26 August 1981, or nearly four (4) years after it considered
the case submitted for decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> the
Court of Appeals handed down a Resolution elevating the case to this Court on
the ground that the errors raised in the appeal involve <span style="">"</span>purely questions of law.”<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the following are the material operative facts and procedural antecedents in
this case:</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs-appellees filed with Branch II (Gubat) of the then
Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) <span style="">of </span>Sorsogon, a complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 383, to
recover from defendants-appellants a parcel of land with an area of 82,862
square meters located in Otavi, Bulan, Sorsogon.  This property corresponds to Lot. No. 6790 of the Bulan
Cadastre.  On 12 March 1971, the trial
court rendered a decision in favor of plaintiffs-appellees, the dispositive
portion of which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-appellants appealed the above decision to the Court of
Appeals which, however, dismissed the appeal on 5 December 1972 for failure of
defendants-appellants to pay the docket fees within the reglementary period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">trial </span>court’s
decision became final and executory on 23 January 1973.  On 29 March 1973, plaintiffs-appellees filed
a motion for its execution which the trial court granted in its Order of 13
April 1973.  On 17 April 1973, the
Deputy Provincial Sheriff of Sorsogon delivered the land in dispute to plaintiffs-appellees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-appellants Lucia G. de Esber and Zoilo Esber, however,
failed to pay the P2,800.00 actual damages and their shares in the costs of the
suit.  For its satisfaction, the
Provincial Sheriff levied <span style="">on </span>4
May 1973 on the following properties of Lucia and Zoilo:  (1) an agricultural land, Lot No. 8275, with
an area of 12.2278 hectares located in Marinab, Bulan, Sorsogon and assessed at
P1,220.00 under Tax Declaration No. 2248 in the name of Zoilo Esber; and (2) a
residential land, Lot No. 360, with an area of 458 square meters, including the
residential house thereon, located in Poblacion, Bulan, Sorsogon and assessed
at P1,830.00 under a Tax Declaration in the name of <span style="">Zoilo </span>Esber.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 26 May 1973, the
Provincial Sheriff issued a Sheriff's Notice of Public Auction Sale of the
foregoing properties, copy furnished defendant-appellant Zoilo Esber and </span>the
<span style="">heirs of plaintiff-appellee Dionisio
Gomez.  The auction sale was scheduled
for 21 June 1973, between 9:00 o'clock in the morning and 4:00 o'clock in the
afternoon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiffs-appellees Fe
Gomez Gealone, Luz Gomez Gueta, and Aquino Gueta, for themselves and on behalf
of the other plaintiffs, whose bid was P3,522.50, were the highest bidders for
the properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 23 June 1973, the
Provincial Sheriff issued a Sheriff's Certificate of Sale to the above highest
bidders, incorporating the statement that the sale is subject to the right of
legal redemption within one year from the date of sale.  Thereafter, on 27 June 1973, the Provincial
Sheriff submitted </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the trial court a Return of Service
summarizing the proceedings of the 21 June 1973 auction sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><span style="">27 June 1974, or after the lapse of the
one-year redemption period, the Provincial Sheriff issued </span>a <span style="">Final Bill of Sale in favor of the highest
bidders.  Plaintiffs-appellees filed, on
11 July 1974, an Ex-Parte Motion for Issuance of Writ of Possession, which the
trial court granted </span>on <span style="">21 August
1974.  The </span><span style="">writ </span><span style="">was issued on 4 September 1974.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Provincial Sheriff
then delivered the auctioned properties to plaintiffs-appellees on 9 September
1974.  On 12 September 1974, he
submitted a Return of Service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 14 September </span>1974,
<span style="">defendants-appellants Zoilo Esber and
Lucia de Esber, through counsel, filed with the trial court </span>an <span style="">"Appearance and Manifestations"
taking exceptions "on the proceedings in this case from the levy on
execution of the real properties owned by the defendants, the auction sale, the
issuance of the certificate and final sale, the writ of delivery of possession
and consequent delivery of </span>possession <span style="">of the properties" arguing that (1) the real properties levied on
execution and later sold in the auction sale have prior and registered liens in
favor of third persons, and (2) the residential house and the land (on) which
the building was constructed is a family home or homestead exempt from
execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently,
plaintiffs-appellees filed, on 5 November 1974, a Petition To Declare
Defendants In Contempt arguing that defendants Lucia </span>G. <span style="">de Esber and </span><span style="">Zoilo </span><span style="">Esber, despite
service of the writ and the warning of the Deputy Provincial Sheriff not to
infringe and disobey the order of this Honorable Court, not to mention repeated
demands made by the </span>plaintiffs, failed and <span style="">refused and continue to fail and refuse to vacate the properties
described in the writ in open violation and disobedience of the order of the
Court and to plaintiffs' damage and prejudice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Acting on the petition
for contempt, the trial court issued an order on 27 November 1974 which, </span><u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">alia</span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">directed Mr. </span>Jesus <span style="">G. Gaerlan,
special deputy sheriff of the court, "to repair to the twelve-hectare
portion which have (sic) been executed and for which a Bill of Sale has been
issued, and then and there place the plaintiffs in immediate possession"
thereof and to make a report to the court immediately after accomplishing the
assignment, and warned that, hereafter, "any complaint by the winning
party </span>in <span style="">regard to disturbance </span>of
<span style="">their </span>(sic) <span style="">possession as well </span>as <span style="">enjoyment of the right of ownership of this </span>twelve-<span style="">hectare</span> <span style="">portion of land </span>will <span style="">be
deemed an act of contempt for which the defendants and/or their agents shall be
held responsible.” It further stated that it will entertain a proper motion
contesting the right to levy upon the property where defendant's house stands
on the ground that it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">exempt from execution under </span>Rule <span style="">39 of the Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 2 December 1974,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>special deputy sheriff </span><span style="">Jesus </span>G. <span style="">Gaerlan submitted to the trial court a Report stating that
plaintiffs-appellees were actually placed in possession of the </span>12-hectare
<span style="">land on 29 November 1974 at about 2:00
o'clock </span>in <span style="">the afternoon.  This was followed by a Supplemental Report
submitted on 5 December 1974 stating that on the very day of </span>submission,
<span style="">Juan Gealone, one of the plaintiffs,
and Anatolia </span>Berjerano, <span style="">informed
him (Gaerlan) and the Clerk of Court that defendant </span>Zoilo <span style="">Esber </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not the real owner of
the land subject of the previous report, and that the true owner and actual po</span>s<span style="">sessor thereof </span>is <span style="">Anatolia Berjerano who inherited the </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">from her mother, Vicenta Siminaino.  In support of her </span>claim <span style="">of
ownership, Anatolia presented Tax Declaration </span>No. 13966 <span style="">in her name covering Lots Nos. 8274 and 8275,
with an area of 13.6408 Has., which area appears to be more </span>or <span style="">less identical, as to location, with that
covered by Tax Declaration No. 1524 of </span>Zoilo <span style="">Esber.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently,
defendants-appellants filed a Motion </span>to <span style="">Set Aside Execution Sale on 12 </span>December 1974 on the grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  That the property described and covered by Tax
(Declaration) No. 2249, Lot No. 360 of the Bulan Cadastre in the <span style="">Sheriff's Notice of Public Auction Sale is
exempt from execution.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  That the execution sale violated Section
15, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court in that the Sheriff sold more property
<span style="">tha(n) what was sufficient to </span>pay
<span style="">the judgment debt and costs.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">3.  That the execution violated Section 21, </span>Rule <span style="">39 of the Revised Rules of Court in that:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">(a)  The properties being of several known lots
(but) the sheriff <span style="">sold the whole
property en masse, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">(b)  The judgment debtor was not given a chance
to direct the order or choose which property should be sold.</p>

<blockquote>4.  The value of defendants' properties as
described in the Sheriff's Notice of Sale is materially and grossly in excess
of the judgment debt and costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  That the value of defendants' properties
described in the Sheriff's Notice of Sale is grossly in excess of the judgment
debt and costs so that enforcement of which amounted to fraud and abuse of
discretion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 28 December 1974, plaintiffs-appellees filed their opposition
to the above motion alleging therein that the failure to assert or claim the
right to the exemption granted under Section 12 (a) of Rule 39 of the Revised
Rules of Court within a reasonable time constituted an abandonment or waiver
thereof, and that there is no merit to the other contentions of defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court issued an Order on 26 June 1975 denying
defendants-appellants' Motion to Set Aside Execution Sale saying:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In regard to the first ground, the defendants maintain that
the parcel of residential land located at Poblacion, Bulan, Sorsogon, with an
area of 485 square meters, together with a residential house of strong
materials, with cement flooring, GI roofing and wooden walling, declared under
Tax Declaration No. 2249 in the name of <span style="">defendant
Zoilo Esber and assessed at P1,830.00 is a ‘homestead’ within the contemplation
of Section 12, Par. (a) of </span><span style="">Rule </span><span style="">39 of the Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Granting, arguendo, that such property is indeed a homestead and
therefore exempt from execution, the rule nevertheless states that the right to
claim exemption must be made by the one in whose favor it exists, <span style="">a </span>claim that <span style="">rests primarily on the judgment debtor (22 Am. Jur. 90), which must be
made at the time of levy if the debtor </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">present, or ‘within a
reasonable time, or promptly, or before the creditor has taken any step
involving further questions, or before advertisement of sale, </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">before the sale, or within a reasonable time before sale, or before the
sale has commenced’ (35 CJS, 157, cited in Francisco, The Revised Rules of
Court in the Phil., Vol. II, 1966, pp. 668 &amp; 669)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">In the case of Cruz Herrera
vs. McMicking, 14 Phil. 641, the Supreme Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘It is questionable whether it is the duty of a sheriff, when he <span style="">has </span>an execution to serve, <span style="">to </span><span style="">present the objection that the property of the judgment debtor </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">exempt from execution.  The
exemption provided for by the law </span><span style="">is
</span><span style="">a right accorded to debtors, and
</span><span style="">a </span><span style="">right which must be insisted upon or it may be lost.  It would therefore seem to be the duty of
the sheriff, whenever he finds property belonging to a judgment debtor when
(he) has an execution to serve, to serve </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">execution </span><span style="">upon </span><span style="">said property and allow the judgment debtor to </span><span style="">claim </span><span style="">his right under the statute.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Also, in the case of Agatep vs. Taguinod, <span style="">36 Phil. 435, it was held that:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Before a debtor can take advantage of the exemption he must bring
himself within the terms thereof.  The
burden of showing his <span style="">right to the
exemption is upon him and he must show himself entitled to it by satisfactory
evidence.  If he fails to do so the
right to exemption does not become effective and the property may be sold.’</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Having asserted this claim for exception only after more than a
year and a half had elapsed from the execution sale and about six months from
and after the issuance of the <span style="">Final
Bill of Sale, this protest </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the defendants </span>comes <span style="">too late.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The second question has reference to the sale at auction of an
agricultural land containing an area of 12.2278 hectares.  According to the defendant Zoilo Esber's Tax
Declaration No. 1524 this property is mainly cogon and thicket land assessed at
P1,960,00 and with <span style="">a </span>true market
value of P4,890.00.  <span style="">And these valuations were made pursuant to
Presidential Decree No. 76.  Under the
circumstances the Court finds that the disparity between the value at which the
property has been sold at public auction to satisfy the judgment credit of
P3,522.50 and that given in Tax Declaration No. 1524 is not so great as to
shock the conscience of an ordinary prudent man.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with this Order, defendants-appellants appealed
therefrom to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Brief<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> filed
on 26 May 1977 with the Court of Appeals, defendants-appellants made the

considered the case submitted for decision; thereafter, it certified the case
to this Court on 26 August 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">Purged of unnecessary embellishments, the assigned errors merely
recommend the issues We stated in the opening paragraph of this Decision.</p>

<p class="NUM">1.  Among the properties
which are exempt from execution is the debtor's family house constituted in

<p class="BODY">The “homestead" which defendants-appellants Zoilo Esber and
Lucia G. de Esber sought to be exempted from execution is a residential land
with an area of 458 square meters, together with the house constructed thereon,
located in the municipality of Bulan, Sorsogon with an assessed value of
P1,830.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">A "homestead" refers to the dwelling house of the
judgment debtor in which he resides and the land necessarily used in connection
therewith.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It is exempt from execution pursuant to Section 12 of Rule 39 if its value at
the time of the execution sale was not more than P3,000.00.  In <u>Cabuhat</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Ansay,</u><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>

it must be understood that the law-making body meant the amount which the
property might reasonably be expected to bring <span style="">if sold under the conditions prevailing at the </span><span style="">time; and in a case where the property has
actually been exposed to public sale, the price which it then brought is of
necessity conclusive between the parties to the execution </span>as <span style="">to its value."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The pleadings of the parties fail to disclose both the actual
value of the property, which appellants claim to be a homestead, at the time of
the execution sale, and the specific price for which it was sold on
execution.  What appears clearly <span style="">is that this property and the 12-hectare lot
were sold to the highest bidders for the consideration of P3,522.50.  In </span>the light of <u>Cabuhat</u> <span style="">and, taking into account the declared value
of the subject property (P1,830.00) and the declared value of the 12-hectare
lot </span>(P1,220.00), <span style="">the
"value" of the claimed homestead was less than P3,000.00 at the time
of the execution sale.  Consequently, it
should have been excluded from execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, however, it was only on 12 December 1974, or
nearly six (6) months after the execution of the Final Bill of <span style="">Sale on 24 June 1974, that appellants filed
their motion to set aside the execution sale.  They did not object to both the levy on the property and the auction
sale thereof.  Neither did they oppose
the execution of the certificate of sale and the Final Bill of Sale by the
Sheriff.  In short, they did not assert
their right to claim exemption until </span>six <span style="">(6) months after the lapse of the one-year period to redeem the
property.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the Rules of Court does not prescribe the period within
which to claim the exemption, the rule is, nevertheless, well-settled that the
right of exemption is a personal privilege granted to the judgment debtor and
as such, it must be claimed <span style="">not by the
sheriff, but by the debtor himself at the time of the levy or within </span>a <span style="">reasonable period thereafter:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the absence of express provision it has variously held
that claim [for exemption] must be made at the time of the levy if the debtor
is present, that it must be made within a reasonable time, or promptly, or
before the <span style="">creditor has taken any step
involving further costs, or before advertisement of sale, or at any time before
sale, or within a reasonable time before the sale, or before the sale has
commenced, but as to the last there is contrary authority.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the facts
above summarized, it is self-evident that appellants did not assert their claim
of exemption within a reasonable time.  Certainly, reasonable time, for purposes of the law on exemption, does
not mean a time after the expiration of the one-year period provided for in
Section 30 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court for judgment debtors to redeem the property
sold on execution, otherwise it would render nugatory final bills of sale on
execution and defeat the very purpose of execution -- </span>to <span style="">put an end to litigation.  We said before, and We repeat it now, that
litigation must end and terminate sometime and somewhere, and it is essential
to an effective administration </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">justice that, once a judgment
has become final, the winning party be not, through a mere subterfuge, deprived
of the fruits of the verdict.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We now rule that claims for exemption from
execution of properties under </span>Section 12 of Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court must be presented before its sale on execution by the sheriff.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The trial court did not err in holding that the price for which
the lots were sold in the execution sale was not grossly inadequate.  The assessed value of the 12-hectare lot <span style="">(Tax Declaration No. 2248) is P1,220.00, and
the assessed value of the other lot and the residential house thereon (Tax
Declaration No. 2249) is P1,830.00.  The
combined assessed value </span>is <span style="">P3,050.00.  Appellants, however, claim that the total
assessed value is P3,790.00.  Granting
the latter to be correct, and conceding further, for the sake argument, to the
statement of appellants that the assessed value of real property for taxation
purposes is 30% of the market value such that the market value then is
P12,633.50,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> still the price for which they were sold at
the execution sale -- P3,522.50 -- </span>is <span style="">not grossly inadequate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The inadequacy of the price is not a ground for setting aside an
execution sale unless the inadequacy is so great as to shock the
conscience.  As early as in the case <u>Warner</u>
<u>Barnes</u> <u><span style="">and</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Co.</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Santos</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
We held:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"A </span>judicial <span style="">sale of </span>real estate will not be set
aside for inadequacy of price unless the inadequacy be so great as to shock the
conscience or unless there be additional circumstances against its
fairness."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, gross inadequacy of the purchase <span style="">price </span>is not material “when the law gives the owner the right to
redeem as when a sale is made at public auction, upon the theory that the
lesser the price the easier it is for the owner <span style="">to </span>effect the redemption.”<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>
