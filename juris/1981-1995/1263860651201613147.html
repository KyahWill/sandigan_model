<p class="BODY">Having received a copy of the Order of June 5, 1981 only on
September 1, 1981, petitioners filed on the same day a motion for
reconsideration of the June 5, 1981 Order and a motion to quash the writ of
execution dated June 10, 1981, calling the attention of the lower court to the
fact that the 30th day of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for
the filing of an appeal fell on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>Sunday so that the filing of the motion on

<p class="BODY">In their motion for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
Order, petitioners manifested that they are in accord with the first paragraph
of said order but seek a reconsideration of the second paragraph by setting the
same aside and ordering the return of the proceeds of P12,000.00 obtained from
the sale of their personal properties considering that private respondents have
not posted a bond as a condition precedent to the taking of said properties as
the same was done pursuant to a decision believed by the private respondents to
be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> but which later turned out not
to be so in view of the allowance of petitioners' motion for new trial by the
respondent lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court denied petitioners' aforesaid motion for
reconsideration in its second assailed Order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1982</st1:date> on the ground that a new trial had been
ordered as early as <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition seeking to annul and set aside the two
aforementioned Orders of respondent judge, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Order dated June 8, 1982 which required
the return of the properties of the petitioners levied upon in execution or, in
the event that this could not be done, for petitioners to go after private
respondents' bond in case of a favorable judgment; and the Order dated December
1, 1982 denying petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the June 8, 1982
order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, petitioners seek to
enjoin respondent court from further proceeding with Civil Case No. 1136-B
except to issue a corresponding order setting aside the herein assailed Orders
of June 8, 1982 and December 1, 1982 and ordering private respondents to return
to Spouses Carlos David and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> David the
proceeds of the public auction sale of their personal properties in the sum of
P12,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners submit that:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Hon. Respondent
Court acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction and/or with grave abuse of
its discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when it issued the Order of
June 8, 1982 directing that in the event return of the personal properties of
Petitioners Spouses could not be done by Private Respondents, Petitioners
spouses may, in the event of a favorable judgment go after Private Respondents’
bond, because there is no bond filed by Private Respondents in said Civil Case
No. 1136-B since said personal properties of Petitioners Spouses were taken by
the Sheriff from them by virtue of a writ of execution (Annex G) and said writ
of execution was set aside and declared null and void by Hon. Respondent Court
in its Order of February 8, 1982 (Annex L).<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Hon. Respondent Court
acted without or in excess of its jurisdiction and/or with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when it issued its order of
December 1, 1982 denying Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration of said Order
of June 8, 1982, for being contrary to law, established jurisprudence on the
matter and an outright denial of substantial justice to Petitioners."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintain that the setting aside of the writ of
execution by the lower court naturally entitled them to recover from private
respondents their personal properties which were prematurely and improvidently
levied upon on execution, or to the reimbursement by private respondents of the
proceeds of the auction sale in the sum of P12,000.00 pending the hearing on
the merits of Civil Case No. 1136-B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They contend that in providing for an alternative in its assailed order
in the event restitution is not possible, the lower court unduly deprived them
of their substantial right without due process as there was no bond <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>speak of in the first place.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondents submit that the lower
court, under the circumstances obtaining in this case, was merely exercising
its sound judicial discretion in not ordering restitution it appearing that the
personal properties levied upon on execution were already sold at public
auction and the proceeds thereof given to them, who, due to the untimely demise
of the sole breadwinner in their family were left orphaned and destitute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, petitioners are barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span> for not taking their legal option to oppose the levy
and public sale of their personal properties which took place while their
motion for new trial was still pending resolution by the lower court and it was
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only </span>on June 5, 1982 or almost a
year after the levy was made, that they moved for the return of the properties
le<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">vied </span>upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule for the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although the Court is aware of private respondents' sad plight, having
suffered the untimely loss of the alleged sole breadwinner of the family,
nevertheless, the Court must go by the precepts of substantive as well as
procedural law in resolving the controversy at bar for to do otherwise would be
tantamount to pre-empting the lower court in its judgment in Civil Case No.
1136-B wherein a new trial had been ordered as a result of the granting of
petitioners' motion for new trial therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As provided under Section 5 of Rule 37 of the Revised Rules of
Court:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"If a new trial be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">granted in </span>accordance with the
provisions of this rule, the original judgment shall be vacated, and the action
shall stand for trial <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">de </span></b><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">novo</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">; </span>but the recorded evidence taken upon
the former trial so far as the same is material and competent to establish the
issues, shall be used at the new trial without retaking the same.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The law is unmistakably clear that once <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">a </span>new trial is granted under aforesaid Rule, the original
judgment is vacated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The phrase "to
vacate" applied to a judgment means "to annul, to render void."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As petitioners' motion for new trial was subsequently granted by
the respondent court, this resulted in the nullification of its judgment by
default dated April 10, 1981 against petitioners in said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">civil </span>case, including all the
consequential effects thereof, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>the Writ of Execution, the corresponding levy on the personal properties
of petitioners and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">public </span>auction
sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court thus finds validity and strength in petitioners' claim
for restitution of the P12,000.00 proceeds of the sale on execution of
petitioners' personal properties levied upon pursuant to a writ of execution
which was subsequently recalled due to the granting of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a </span>new trial in the subject civil case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the motion for restitution
was filed while the subject civil case was still undergoing trial, a stage
wherein the rights and obligations of the parties have not yet been determined,
it would be unfairly enriching the private respondents, even temporarily, if
they are allowed to keep possession of the proceeds of the sale of petitioners'
personal properties in the amount of P12,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As Civil Case No. 1136-B then stood, there
has yet been no adjudication of rights and obligations between the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, there was never a plaintiff's
bond to speak of in the first place against which petitioners may proceed in
case of a favorable judgment since the writ of execution was issued pursuant to
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>judgment then thought to be
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing considerations, the second
paragraph of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>Order of
respondent court dated June 8, 1982 allowing petitioners as defendants therein
in case of a favorable judgment to go after the plaintiffs' bond if restitution
was not effected; and the Order of December 1, 1982 are hereby SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents are hereby ORDERED to
return to petitioners Spouses Carlos David and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
David the proceeds of the public auction sale of their personal properties in
the sum of P12,000.00.</p>
