				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For our review is the decision of the Court of Appeals in the
case entitled “State Investment House, Inc. v. Bataan Cigar &amp; Cigarette
Factory, Inc.,”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> in a
complaint filed by State Investment House, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as
SIHI) for collection on three unpaid checks issued by Bataan Cigar &amp;
Cigarette Factory, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as BCCFI).  The foregoing decisions unanimously ruled in
favor of SIHI, the private respondent in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Emanating from the records are the following facts.  Petitioner, Bataan Cigar and Cigarette
Factory, Inc. <span style="">(BCCFI), </span>a
corporation involved in the manufacturing of cigarettes, engaged one of its
suppliers, King Tim Pua George (herein after referred to as George King), to
deliver 2,000 bales of tobacco leaf starting October 1978.  In consideration thereof, BCCFI, on July 13,
1978 issued <b>crossed </b>checks post dated sometime in March 1979 in the
total amount of P820,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Relying on the supplier’s representation that he would complete
delivery within three months from December 5, 1978, petitioner agreed to
purchase additional 2,500 bales of tobacco leaves, despite the supplier’s
failure to deliver in accordance with their earlier agreement.  Again petitioner issued postdated <b>crossed
</b>checks in the total amount of P1,100,000.00, payable sometime in September
1979.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During these times, George King was simultaneously dealing with
private respondent SIHI.  On July 19,
1978, he sold at a discount check TCBT 551826<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> bearing
an amount of P164,000.00, post dated March 31, 1979, drawn by petitioner,
naming George King as payee to SIHI.  On
December 19 and 26, 1978, he again sold to respondent checks TCBT Nos. 608967
&amp; 608968,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
both in the amount of P100,000.00, post dated September 15 &amp; 30, 1979 respectively,
drawn by petitioner in favor of George King.</p>

<p class="BODY">In as much as George King failed to deliver the bales of tobacco
leaf as agreed despite petitioner’s demand, BCCFI issued on March 30, 1979, a
stop payment order on all checks payable to George King, including check TCBT
551826.  Subsequently, stop payment was
also ordered on checks TCBT Nos. 608967 &amp; 608968 on September 14 &amp; 28,
1979, respectively, due to George King’s failure to deliver the tobacco leaves.</p>

<p class="BODY">Efforts of SIHI to collect from BCCFI having failed, it
instituted the present case, naming only BCCFI as party defendant.  The trial court pronounced SIHI as having a
valid claim being a holder in due course  It further said that the non-inclusion of King Tim Pua George as party
defendant is immaterial in this case, since he, as payee, is not an
indispensable party.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue then is whether SIHI, a second indorser, and
holder of crossed checks, is a holder in due course, to be able to collect from
the drawer, BCCFI.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Negotiable Instruments Law states what constitutes a holder
in due course, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 52 - A holder in due course is a holder who has taken the
instrument under the following conditions:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(a)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That it is complete and regular upon its face;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="">(b)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]-->That
he became the holder of it before it was overdue, and without notice that it
had been previously dishonored, if such was the fact;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(c)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That he took it in good faith and for value;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(d)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That at the time it was negotiated to him he had no notice of
any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the person
negotiating it.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 59 of the NIL further states that every holder is deemed
prima facie a holder in due course.  However, when it is shown that the title of any person who has
negotiated the instrument was defective, the burden is on the holder to prove
that he or some person under whom he claims, acquired the title as holder in
due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts in this present case are on all fours to the case of <i>State
Investment House, Inc. </i>(the very respondent in this case) v. <i>Intermediate
Appellate Court</i><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein we made a discourse on the effects of crossing of checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a preliminary, a check is defined by law as a bill of exchange
drawn on a bank payable on demand.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> There
are a variety of checks, the more popular of which are the memorandum check,
cashier’s check, traveler’s check and crossed check.  Crossed check is one where two parallel lines are drawn across
its face or across a corner thereof.  It
may be crossed generally or specially.</p>

<p class="BODY">A check is crossed specially when the name of a particular banker
or a company is written between the parallel lines drawn.  It is crossed generally when only the words
“and company” are written or nothing is written at all between the parallel lines.  It may be issued so that presentment can be
made only by a bank.  Veritably the
Negotiable Instruments Law (NIL) does not mention “crossed checks,” although
Article 541<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Code of Commerce refers to such instruments.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to commentators, the negotiability of a check is not
affected by its being crossed, whether <span style="">specially
or </span>generally.  It may legally be
negotiated from one person to another as long as the one who encashes the check
with the drawee bank is another bank, or if it is specially crossed, by the
bank mentioned between the parallel lines.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> This
is specially true in England where the Negotiable Instrument Law originated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Philippine business setting, however, we used to be beset
with bouncing checks, forging of checks, and so forth that banks have become
quite guarded in encashing checks, particularly those which name a specific
payee.  Unless one is a valued client, a
bank will not even accept second indorsements on checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order to preserve the credit worthiness of checks,
jurisprudence has pronounced that crossing of a check should have the following
effects:  (a) the check may <i><span style="">not </span></i>be encashed but only deposited
in the bank; (b) the check may be negotiated <i><span style="">only once - </span></i>to one who has an account with a bank; (c) and
the act of crossing the check serves as <i><span style="">warning </span></i>to the holder that the check has been issued <i><u><span style="">for a definite purpose</span></u></i><span style=""> </span>so that he must inquire if he has
received the check pursuant to that purpose, otherwise, he is <b><span style="">not a </span></b><b><span style="">holder </span>in </b><b><span style="">due
course.</span></b><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing was adopted in the case of SIHI v. IAC, <i><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">.  </span>In that case, New
Sikatuna Wood Industries, Inc. also sold at a discount to SIHI three postdated
crossed checks, issued by Anita Peña Chua naming as payee New Sikatuna Wood
Industries, Inc.  Ruling that SIHI was
not a holder in due course, we then said:</p>

<blockquote>“The three checks in the case at bar had been crossed generally and
issued payable to New Sikatuna Wood Industries, Inc. which could only mean that
the drawer had intended the same for deposit only by the rightful person, i.e.
the payee named therein.  Apparently, it
was not the payee who presented the same for payment and therefore, there was
no proper presentment, and the liability did not attach to the drawer.  Thus, in the absence of due presentment, the
drawer did not become liable.  Consequently, no right of recourse is available to petitioner (SIHI)
against the drawer of the subject checks, private respondent wife (Anita),
considering that petitioner is not the <span style="">proper
party authorized to make presentment of the checks in question.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That the subject checks had been issued subject to the condition
that private respondents (Anita and her husband) on due date would make the
back up deposit for said checks but which condition apparently was not made,
thus resulting in the non-consumation of the loan intended to be granted by
private respondents to New Sikatuna Wood Industries, Inc., constitutes a good
defense against petitioner <b>who is not a holder in due</b> <b>course.</b>”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is then settled that crossing of checks should put the holder
on inquiry and upon him devolves the duty to ascertain the indorser’s title to
the check or the nature of his possession.  Failing in this respect, the holder is declared guilty of gross
negligence amounting to legal absence of good faith, contrary to Sec. 52(c) of the
Negotiable Instruments Law,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> and
as such the consensus of authority is to the effect that the holder of the
check is not a holder in due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, BCCFI’s defense in stopping payment is as
good to SIHI as it is to George King.  Because, really, the checks were issued with the intention that George
King would supply BCCFI with the bales of tobacco leaf.  There being failure of consideration, SIHI
is not a holder in due course.  Consequently, BCCFI cannot be obliged to pay the checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing does not mean, however, that respondent could not
recover from the checks.  The only
disadvantage of a holder who is not a holder in due course is that the
instrument is subject to defenses as if it were non-negotiable.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, respondent can collect from the immediate indorser, in this case, George
King.</p>

application of law, the instant petition is hereby <span style="">GRANTED.  </span>The decision of the
