October 5, 1981, the off<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ice </span>of
the PC, CANU received information about the presence of a drug pusher at Pedro

informant, whose </span>name was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not
disclosed for security reasons, wherein the letter gave the accused a marked
P50.00 bill.  This </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">transaction was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">witnessed by the </span>two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">officers at</span> a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">distance of about five (5) meters.  Thereafter the accused left to secure the prohibited drug without being
followed by the two (2) officers.  Accused returned </span>after <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">30
minutes and in the process of </span>giving <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">nine (9) Mogadon tablets to the confidential informant, the two CANU
officers introduced </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">themselves
to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the accused (pp. 7-8, Ibid.)
and inquired from him where he secured them (p. 12. I</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">bid.).  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The </span>accused led

alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">supplier of the Mogadon
tablets.  However, said Jojo was nowhere

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Accused, who was taken to
Camp Crame for further investigation, admitted his guilt in a written
unsubscribed statement after being informed of his constitutional rights.  The nine (9) tablets of Mogadon were
submitted to the laboratory for analysis.  In her testimony later in court, Lt. Nelly Cariaga of the Philippine
Constabulary Crime Laboratory testified that the nine (9) tablets of Mogadon
marked 'Roche' wrapped in aluminum foil (Exh. C), which were the same nine (9)
tablets of Mogadon</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">submitted for examination showed a positive

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand,
defense gave the following version:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On October 5, 1981 at
about 11:30 o'clock in the morning, the accused was inside the premises of
Arellano University, F.G. Calderon High School, located at Pedro Gil Street,
Sta. Ana, Manila, where he is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">student.  Then Eddie Chua, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">student of Mapua Institute called him and invited him to a nearby
restaurant - the Egg Bitter Restaurant for a softdrink.  While thereat they saw "Boy
Toothpick" and Joel Garcia.  "Boy Toothpick" is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">student but he does
not know of what school while Joel Garcia is also a student of Arellano
University.  "Boy Toothpick"
and Joel Garcia joined them (accused and Eddie Chua) and when they had finished
their drinks, the CANU agents, Sgt. Lasam and Lt. Marcelo, arrived.  The accused was then handed fifty pesos
(P50.00) consisting of two (2) P20.00 bills and one (1) P10.00 bill by
"Boy Toothpick" and was told to buy Mogadon.  The accused refused as Eddie Chua and
"Boy Toothpick" did not want to accompany him.  However the CANU agents assured and told the
</span>accused they would follow him so that they could apprehend the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">seller.  </span>The accused then took a tricycle to buy the Mogadon tablets in
Makati.  He did not see anybody
following him but nevertheless bought the Mogadon tablets for fear of being
mauled by the group.  When he returned
with the Mogadon tablets which cost P49.50 and while on his way to the
restaurant, the CANU agents immediately arrested him.  He gave the change of P0.50<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">
</span>to "Boy Toothpick".  He
was then brought to Camp Crame where he was detained.  He was made to sign a blank paper at about midnight of the same
date.  He signed the same because he was
promised to be freed if he signs it.  The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p</span>erson who
investigated him is not one of the CANU agents.  That at the time of his arrest, he was merely 19 years old. (Brief
for the Appellant, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p</span>p. 3 &amp;
4).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court after giving more weight to the evidence for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p</span>rosecution rendered a decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

13.0pt">portion of </span>which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of of the foregoing, the Court finds the
accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having violated Sec. 15 of Article
III of RA 6425 as amended by PD No. 44 and as further amended by PD No, 1683<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

subsidiary </span>imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (p. 46, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Hence the accused
interposed the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The appeal is not worthy
of consideration.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The d<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">etermination of the issues
on appeal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">raised </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by app</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ellant </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">hinges on the
credibility of the witnesses.  The
defense maintains that appellant was instigated and not entrapped by the
Philippine Constabulary, CANU and to substantiate such </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">claim, accused </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">himself was presented as the only witness for the defense.  The trial court, obviously gave more weight
to the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">evidence </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for the prosecution in convicting the
accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Accused himself testified
that it was agreed that he will be followed by the CANU agents or officers in
buying the Mogadon in order to determine the person who is selling the Mogadon
tablets and to apprehend him (Appellant's brief, p. 8) but at the same time
admitted that he did not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">see </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the CANU agents following him and yet he
claimed that despite this, he still bought the drugs out of sheer fear that
they might maul him.  Such testimony
fails to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">convince </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Us of witness' </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">credibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> is clear from the established facts that
appellant was caught committing the crime charged.  He was the one who </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">delivered
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the Mogadon tablets to the
confidential informant.  He </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">one who supplied the name of a non-existent "Jojo" as the
source of the prohibited drug.  There is
no dispute that appellant received P50.00 and handed nine (9) Mogadon tablets.  The testimony of Lt. Marcelo that appellant
left for thirty (30) minutes is not at all in conflict with the testimony of
Sgt. Lasam that appellant returned after more or less one (1) hour.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">And
even </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">if </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it were, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the inconsistency is immaterial.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant has failed miserably to show any reason or improper
motive why the witnesses for the prosecution would implicate him.  The fact that the confidential informant was
not presented as a witness does not affect the findings or the lower court
since his additional testimony would merely be<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span>corroborative to the testimonies of Lt. Marcelo and Sgt. Lasam,
whose testimonies were found by the trial court to be worthy of credit.  All these taken into consideration, We are
satisfied that the trial court has not overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied
some fact or circumstance of weight and substance as would affect the result of
the case.</p>
