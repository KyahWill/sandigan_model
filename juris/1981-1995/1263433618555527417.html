by the Acting Register of Deeds, Arturo Suarez for the reason that the adverse
claim does not affect Lot I of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 12547.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents filed a complaint for Recovery of Ownership
and Possession with petition for Issuance of Writ of Preliminary Mandatory
Injunction for the recovery of the 214 square meters occupied by the stage of
the Metro Theatre with Branch XII, Regional Trial Court of Ormoc City.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge on March 30, 1983 granted the Petition for
Issuance of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction based on the following conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>"By comparing the area of 677 square meters as stated in the
deed of sale between Gregorio Yrastorza as vendor and defendants as vendees,
the area covered by TCT No. 2899 which was later cancelled <span style="">by</span> TCT NO. 4020 with an area of 463 sq.
m., there would appear a difference of 214 sq. m., and that from this
difference of 214 sq. m., there could be no other logical conclusion for this
Court to arrive at but to hold that such difference caused <span style="">by </span>the Deed of Sale was purely a
clerical error and that what was sold under the circumstances is that area of
463 sq. m., covered <span style="">by </span>TCT No.
2899 and cancelled <span style="">by </span>TCT No.
4020.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Without going into the merits of the case so as to determine
whether or not the defendant's occupation of said portion was made in bad or
good faith, what actually was bought <span style="">by </span>the
defendants from Gregorio Yrastorza was only that lot which consisted of 463 sq.
m., as described in TCT No. 2899 registered in the names of Gregorio Yrastorza
and Adelina Alonso, which was cancelled <span style="">by
</span>TCT No. 4020 now in the names of the defendants.  It cannot be said that plaintiffs should be
deprived of their ownership over the 214 sq. m., because that area is
definitely within the portion of the land acquired by the plaintiffs as
described in TCT No. 17360, registered in their names.  The registered titles of each of the parties
are imprescriptible.  Consequently,
under the circumstances, plaintiffs' right over such portion of 214 sq. m., is
clearly established.  Considering that
there is an extreme urgency for the plaintiffs to enter the premises in
question, further that the building or improvement of the defendants is a
dilapidated structure, as per Certification of <span style="">the </span>City Planning and Development Office, Ormoc City and the
Annual Inspection Report of the Office of the Building Official Ormoc City, the
continuation <span style="">by </span>the defendants of
their acts of intrusion would doubtlessly cause upon the plaintiff's
inconvenience, prejudice, grave injury and irreparable damage.  Upon these weighty considerations, this
Court is constrained to grant the plaintiffs their Petition for the issuance of
a Writ of Preliminary Mandatory Injunction, authorizing them to enter into
possession over the area of 214 sq. m., as described in the Relocated Plan
(Annex 1-1) of Annex I."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the lower court, petitioner
brought the matter to this Court in a Petition for Injunction, <i>Mandamus </i>and
<i>Certiorari </i>but the case was referred to the then Intermediate Appellate
Court for the purpose <span style="">of </span>determining
a question of fact of whether the parties in this case are the registered
owners of their respective parcels of land namely:  for petitioners Tan, Lot 1 of the Consolidation and Subdivision
of Cad. Lots 31 and 32 of the Ormoc Cadastre covered <span style="">by </span>T.C.T. No. 4020 and with an area of 463 square meters
originally registered in the name of Gregorio Yrastorza under T.C.T. No. 2899;
for private respondents Larrazabals, Lot No. 1 of Subdivision Plan, Psd-177251
containing an area of 856 square meters as described in Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 17360 and which parcel of land was originally registered in the name
of Gregorio Yrastorza under T.C.T. No. 12547.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court in a decision promulgated on August 30, 1983
dismissed the petition, stating as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From this TCT-2899 it is clear that the First Lot covers only
463 sq. m. and not 677 sq. m. as maintained <span style="">by </span>petitioners.  Indeed,
after the sale, petitioners had TCT 2899 cancelled and replaced by TCT
4020.  Again, TCT 4020 speaks of 463,
sq. m. of land only.  They then paid
real property tax on this 463 sq. m. of land.  In fine, We cannot see how respondent judge could have committed grave
abuse of discretion in initially recognizing the right of the private
respondents over the disputed 214 sq. m. of lot for the purpose of issuing a
writ of preliminary injunction."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question as to the right of petitioners over the 463
square meters lot described in T.C.T. No. 4020 and in the same manner so is
private respondents' right over Lot No. 1 of Psd-177251 covering 856 square
meters as evidenced by T.C.T. No. 17360.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, there must have been a mistake committed in drafting the
Deed of Sale executed by Gregorio C. Yrastorza in favor of Atty. Jorge Tan when
he sold Lot No. One (1) of the Consolidation and Subdivision of Cad. Lots 31
and 32 of Ormoc Cadastre; x x containing an area of Six Hundred Seventy-Seven
(677) square meters, more or less, and covered by Transfer Certificate of Title
No. Two Thousand Eight Hundred Ninety-Nine (TCT-2899)<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since what Gregorio Yrastorza sold to Atty. Jorge Tan is Lot 1
covered by TCT No. 2899 with an area of 463 square meters only, it follows that
he could not have sold an area more than what is stated in the title.  Consequently, when TCT No. 2899 was
cancelled and TCT NO. 4020 was issued in the name of the vendor, Jorge S. Tan,
it is only for a 463 square meters property, no more, no less.</p>

<p class="BODY">What really defines a piece of land is not the area mentioned in
its description, but the boundaries therein laid down, as enclosing the land
and indicating its limits.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the identity of the land is Lot 1 of the
Consolidated Lots 31 and 32 and the boundaries are sufficiently and certainly
describe in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 4020 and speaks of no other area
but 463 square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it is settled that titled property cannot be
attacked collaterally.  It can only be altered,
modified or cancelled in a direct proceeding in accordance with law.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts and circumstances clearly show that private
respondents are entitled to the Writ sought for because of a clear right over
the property in question and that urgency, expediency and necessity require
immediate possession while the petitioners on the other hand, are more than
amply secured by a bond of P100,000.00 as required by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error in the Orders
appealed from, the same is hereby AFFIRMED.  Petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.</p>
