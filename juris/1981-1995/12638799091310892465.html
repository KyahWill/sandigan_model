				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">What started out as an ordinary complaint for damages has
developed into <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>controversy on
procedure over which the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals have not
agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners are now before
us and ask that the issue be resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material facts are briefly related.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in March 1975, Decision Systems Corporation and its
President, Manuel A. <span class="SpellE">Alcuaz</span>, Jr., filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>complaint in the Regional Trial
Court of Manila alleging that defendants Travel Wide Associated Sales (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.), Inc. and Trans World Airlines, Inc. had failed to
comply with their obligations under Travel Pass â€˜73 U.S.A., a package deal
consisting of a TWA ticket to Los Angeles, New York and Boston, in the United
States, and hotel accommodations, for which the plaintiffs had made the
corresponding payment in Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on a motion to dismiss filed by TW<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">A </span>on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1975</st1:date>,
on the ground that the complaint did not state a cause of action, the trial
court ordered the plaintiffs to amend their complaint and particularize their
averments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs complied on <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="7">July
 7, 1975</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1975</st1:date>,
respectively, TWA and Travel Wide filed separate motions to dismiss on the
ground that the amended complaint still did not state <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both
motions were denied on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1975</st1:date>,
the trial court holding that the allegations were now "sufficiently
particular."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1975</st1:date>,
the defendants filed a joint answer in which they alleged the special defense
that they were not the real parties-in-interest because they had acted only as
agents of a disclosed principal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
reiterated this argument at the pre-trial held on <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, they filed a Joint Motion for Preliminary Hearing of
Special Defense, which was opposed by the plaintiffs on the ground that the
special defense was barred, not having been raised in the two motions to
dismiss the amended complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The joint
motion was nevertheless granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the preliminary hearing, Judge Bernardo P. Fernandez issued
his order dated <st1:date year="1976" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1976</st1:date>,
dismissing the complaint.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
His finding was that Travel Wide was wily the general agent of TWA and that the
latter was only an agent of a disclosed principal, namely, Tour Services,
Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As neither of the defendants was a
real party-in-interest, there could be no cause of action against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for its reconsideration having been denied, the order
was elevated to the then Intermediate Appellate Court, which, on <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1983</st1:date>, reversed the trial
court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The record does not show why the separate motions for reconsideration filed by
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were resolved only on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the petitioners have seasonably
come to this Court to ask for the reversal instead of the respondent court and
the reinstatement of the order of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the Court of Appeals did not err in setting aside
the order of dismissal and remanding the case for further proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We disagree, however, with the reason for its
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court held that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
should have pleaded the special defense that they were not real
parties-in-interest in their motion to dismiss, conformably to the omnibus
motion rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not having done so, they
are deemed to have waived that ground, which therefore could not be used <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the basis of the motion to
dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">The omnibus motion rule embodied in Rule 15, Section 8, of the
Rules of Court reads <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 8. <u>Omnibus motion</u>. - A motion attacking <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>pleading or a proceeding shall
include all objections then available, and all objections not so included shall
be deemed waived.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is reiterated in Rule 9, Section 2, which also provides for
the exceptions thus:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 2. <u>Defenses and objections not pleaded deemed waived</u>. -
Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in an
answer are deemed waived, except the failure to state a cause of action which
may be alleged in a latter pleading, if one is permitted, or by motion for
judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits; but in the last instance,
the motion shall be disposed of as provided in section 5, Rule 10 in the light
of any evidence which may have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">been
received.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whenever it appears that the
court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, it shall dismiss the action.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners invoke Rules 16, Section 1, of the Rules of Court
and argue that "the defense of not being <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a real </span>party-in-interest" is not one of the grounds
enumerated therein for <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>motion
to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, they could not
have pleaded it in their motion to dismiss but only in their answer as a
special defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">There seems to be a misconception here of the term "real
party-in-interest."</p>

<p class="BODY">As defined, a real party-in-interest is the party who stands to
be benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit, or the party entitled to
the avails of the suit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Rule 3, Section 2, of the Rules of Court provides explicitly that "every
action must be prosecuted and defended in the name of the real
party-in-interest." The party-in-interest is one who <u>prosecutes</u> or <u>defends</u>
and is <u>benefited</u> or <u>injured</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The term applies not only to the plaintiff but to the defendant, and the
suit may be dismissed if neither of them is a real party-in?interest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
If the suit is not brought <u>in the name of</u> or <u>against</u> the real
party-in-interest, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>motion to
dismiss may be filed on the ground that the complaint states no cause of
action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, even if the special defense <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">was </span>not invoked in the motion to dismiss, it would still not be
deemed waived because it is one of the two exceptions mentioned in Rules 9,
Section 2, to the omnibus motion rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is </span>lack of
jurisdiction, which can be invoked any time, even on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">lack </span>of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cause </span>of
action, which can be raised even during the trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span>It is understandable if in granting the
motion for a preliminary hearing on the special defense, the trial judge relied
on Rule 16, Section 5, of the Rules of Court, providing <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>Section 5. <u>Pleading grounds as affirmative defenses</u>. - Any
of the grounds for dismissal provided for in this rule, except improper venue,
may be pleaded as an affirmative defense, and a preliminary hearing may be had
thereon as if <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>motion to
dismiss had been filed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, the following doctrine laid down in The Heirs of Juliana
<span class="SpellE">Clavano</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Genato</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
should have guided him to the contrary, and correct, conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>Besides, under this section a preliminary hearing may be had on the
affirmative defenses <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>if a
motion to dismiss had been filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During
such preliminary hearing evidence may be admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, We believe that the respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Judge committed an error in conducting </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">preliminary hearing on the private respondent's affirmative
defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">well-settled rule that in a motion to dismiss based on the ground that
the complaint fails to state a cause of action, the question submitted to the
court for determination is the sufficiency of the allegations in the complaint
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether those allegations are
true or not is beside the point, for their truth is hypothetically admitted </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue rather is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>admitting them to be true, may the court
render </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">valid judgment in
accordance with the prayer of the complaint?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stated otherwise, the sufficiency of the cause of action must appear on
the face of the complaint in order to sustain </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">dismissal on this ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
extraneous matter may be considered nor facts not alleged, which would require
evidence and therefore must be raised as defenses and await the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, to determine the sufficiency
of the cause of action, only the facts alleged in the complaint, and no others
should be considered.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondent Judge departed from this rule in conducting a
hearing and in receiving evidence in support of the private respondent's
affirmative defense, that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is, </span>lack of cause of action.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But despite all the foregoing observations, we feel that the
trial court may also have erred in holding that the petitioners were mere
agents of a disclosed principal and so could not be held liable on the
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span> disclaiming liability,
the petitioners point to the stipulation on Responsibility in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Travel</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Pass</st1:placetype></st1:place> â€˜73 Plan brochure that
"Tour Services, Inc. and/or their agents" are acting "as agents
for the passengers." They stress further that the Miscellaneous Charge
Order issued to <span class="SpellE">Alcuaz</span> indicated that the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>$218.00 was payable to Tour
Services, Inc. and not to either of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This would mean that, if at all, they were acting as agents of Tour
Services, Inc. and not as principal obligors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without arriving at any factual conclusion, the Court believes it
would be useful to make <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>more careful appraisal of the evidence, particularly the terms
and conditions of the brochure distributed by the petitioners and the
significance of the Miscellaneous Charges Order which was issued by TWA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We </span>note that even the trial court observed
the active participation of TWA in the promotion of the travel pass plan as an
additional source of revenue for its airline business.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also worth noting that if the petitioners were indeed
acting as agents of the passengers, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the brochure stipulates, they could still
be held liable under Article 1909 of the Civil Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>The agent is responsible not only for fraud, but also for
negligence, which shall be judged with more or less rigor by the courts,
according to whether the agency was or was not for a compensation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> is
entitled to prove that the petitioners did not provide adequately for the
pre-paid hotel accommodations of <span class="SpellE">Alcuaz</span>, who had to
incur additional expenses and was compelled to cut short his business trip
because of his depleted dollar allocation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was not established that the petitioners received any confirmation of
the hotel reservations they sent and yet they did not follow up their request
nor did they inform <span class="SpellE">Alcuaz</span> that they had not received
confirmation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This procedure should have
been followed by the petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>so provided in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Travel</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Pass</st1:placetype></st1:place> â€˜73 <st1:country-region><st1:place>USA</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the respondent court in ruling that the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">court </span>should not have dismissed the
complaint, albeit nor for the reasons given in the challenged decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our finding is that, because the petitioners
are real parties?in-interest as defendants in the suit below, the motion
to dismiss for lack of a cause of action should not have been granted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED, with costs against the
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>
