				<BR><STRONG>GRIÑO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for review, the petitioners assail the decision
of the Court of Appeals affirming, with modification of the penalty only, the
decision of the trial court which convicted petitioner Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span> of homicide for the fatal stabbing of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span>, but which appreciated in his favor the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court and the Court of Appeals also convicted his wife, Norma <span class="SpellE">Closa</span>, of slight physical injuries committed against the
deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of Appeals set
forth </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">its decision the conflicting versions of the
prosecution and the defense as to how the crime was committed, thus:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The facts as summarized in the People’s brief as borne out by
the evidence and WE quote, [are] as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"'The evidence for the
prosecution showed that on October 24, 1982, at about 2:20 o'clock in the
afternoon, prosecution eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pamaus</span>, a childhood friend of appellant spouses Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span> and Norma <span class="SpellE">Closa</span> as well
as of the victim, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span>, was in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> going towards the store of appellants for the purpose
of buying bread.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While said eyewitness
was about four meters distance from the store, he saw the victim, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span>, walking back and forth in front of said store and
appellant Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span> was also present
thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was while Rogelio, who was
still walking back and forth, had his back turned away from Marcelo <span style="">when </span>the latter, in the presence of his
spouse and co-appellant Norma <span class="SpellE">Closa</span>, pulled from his
waist a short bolo or '<span class="SpellE">pisao</span>’ measuring about 7-1/2
inches in length (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'D') and stabbed Rogelio at
the back with said weapon (pp. 2-6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1984</st1:date>).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>"'After being wounded, Rogelio <span style="">ran away </span>but was chased by Marcelo who
was still holding the '<span class="SpellE">pisao</span>' with his right hand and
was closely being followed by his wife and co-appellant, Norma <span class="SpellE">Closa</span>, across the national highway and inside the hollow
block-fenced yard of a certain Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Catching up with Rogelio inside the fenced
yard of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span> where Rogelio had already <span class="GramE">fallen</span> face downward upon entering the same, Marcelo stabbed
Rogelio again at the back of the latter with the '<span class="SpellE">pisao</span>.'
Meanwhile, Norma <span class="SpellE">Closa</span>, who had picked up a stone
measuring about 8 inches in length and 3-3/4 inches in width (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'E') struck the fallen Rogelio with said stone held by
both her hands, hitting the latter on the left side of the face near the ear
(pp. 5-8, 20, 21, 23, 24, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1984</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="2Q">"'Another eyewitness who was present and who saw the incident
in question from its inception up to the time of its termination and who in
fact tried to pacify Marcelo and Rogelio was <span class="SpellE">Eleno</span> <span class="SpellE">Requioma</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
Marcelo inflicted on Rogelio the second stab wound at the back and Norma <span class="SpellE">Closa</span> hit the latter with a stone (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'E') on the left side of the face near the ear and appellants went back to their
house, it was <span class="SpellE">Requioma</span>, together with <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Moquia</span> and Rolando <span class="SpellE">Molero</span>, who brought the victim to the <span class="SpellE">Abuyog</span>
General Hospital where he later expired (pp. 5, 25, 26, 28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
March 16, 1984).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Requioma</span>,
however, failed to testify for the prosecution as he died during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of trial of the case (p. 6, decision, p. 229,
record).'</p>

<blockquote>"The defense’ evidence was briefly stated in the appellant's
brief which WE also quote, as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'At the trial of this case, principal accused MARCELO JERVOSO
declared that on October 24, 1982 at about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon he was
in his office situated in front of his main house which is also near his store,
making list of goods to be purchased in <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City
for his store; that his wife Norma <span class="SpellE">Closa</span> was inside
their house bathing their children preparatory to <span style="">their </span>taking their afternoon nap; that Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span>, son of the brother of his adoptive father, entered
his office without knocking, and arrogantly asked him why he was possessing the
lands of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span> when he is not the real son
and he is not also a legally adopted son; that Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span>
was drunk at the time, demanded that an accounting of all the produce of the
coconuts and <span class="SpellE">palay</span> of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Jervoso's</span>
lands; that he told Rogelio to come back the next day so both of them would go
and see his adoptive mother <span class="SpellE">Afra</span> Diaz who can
enlighten him (Rogelio) about the matter.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"'Seeing Rogelio already belligerent, Marcelo went outside his
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While he was already outside and
about a meter from his store, he saw Ramon Taro and heard him shout:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Boy, don't do that!' 'Boy' is the nickname
of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon hearing Ramon Taro shout, Marcelo looked back just as Rogelio
delivered a stabbing blow on him, hitting him on the left back part of his upper
arm, with a '<span class="SpellE">pisao</span>' (Exhibit 'D').</p>

<p class="2Q">"'After the first stab blow delivered by Rogelio, he (Marcelo)
ran across the <st1:street><st1:address>National Highway</st1:address></st1:street>
towards the gate of the house of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo was able to enter the front yard of
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Olmedo's</span> premises and he tried to escape, but
Rogelio intercepted him by passing the other way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo ran toward the corner but was met by
Rogelio, so he tried to retrace his steps to the gate, but when he was about to
go out of the gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rogelio lunged at
him and delivered another stabbing blow but he was able to get hold of the
right writs of Rogelio's hand holding the deadly weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, Rogelio's left arm was choking his
check (sic) and pushing him towards the concrete fence of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Olmedo</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">"'So, </span>he
struggled to get hold of the '<span class="SpellE">pisao</span>' and was able to
wrest it from the hold <span style="">of </span>Rogelio
by twisting Rogelio's right hand, but Rogelio was still holding his neck pinned
in his left arm against the concrete fence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To defend himself, Marcelo delivered two stabbing blows at the back of
Rogelio -- the first blow, with a downward stroke on his right back portion and
the second by an upward stroke on his left back portion.</p>

<p class="2Q">“‘After stabbing the victim Rogelio, he pushed Rogelio <span style="">who </span>fell to the ground on his left
side, he ran towards the gate of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Olmedo's</span>
premises and on his way out he saw Ramon Taro and called him instructing him to
fetch a policeman.’” <span class="GramE">(pp. 31-34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's <span style="">finding </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">the plea of
self-defense was not proven by clear and convincing evidence:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Regrettably missing in the appellants' evidence are the
elements of self-defense which are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent
and repel it; and (3) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person
defending himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense failed to
demonstrate the concurrence of the three essential elements with satisfactory
evidence so as to entitle the appellant of the defense of self-defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WE are entirely in accord with the trial court that the
affirmative defense of self-defense was not proven by clear and convincing
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence is doubtful, and
lacks that requisite of certainty and sufficient credulity to sustain the plea
of self-defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Suffice it to say that the trial court did not err in finding
that the guilt of both appellant was proven with proof beyond reasonable
doubt." <span class="GramE">(p. 36, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of its decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is hereby MODIFIED in the
sense that the penalty to be imposed on appellant Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span>,
should be an imprisonment of six (6) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor as minimum to twelve (12) years of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor as maximum, and to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span> in the amount of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, Philippine Currency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In all other respects, the appealed judgment is hereby
affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against both appellants."</span> <span class="GramE">(p. 37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their petition for
review, the petitioners allege that the Court of Appeals erred:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1) in ordering them
(petitioners) to pay indemnity of P30<span class="GramE">,000</span> to the heirs
of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span> despite the reservation by said
heirs of their right to file a separate civil action against the accused, which
they did file in the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XXXI where it was
docketed as Civil Case No. 83-18958 entitled, "<span class="SpellE">Digna</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carino-Jervoso</span>, et al. vs. Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span> and Norma <span class="SpellE">Closa</span>;"
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) <span class="GramE">in</span> finding the petitioners guilty of the crimes charged
without support of competent evidence and contrary to applicable laws and
decisions of this Court.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1, Rule 111 of the Rules of Court
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section.</span> 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Institution of criminal and civil
actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When a criminal action is
instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability is impliedly
instituted with the criminal action, <u>unless</u> <u>the</u> <u>offended</u> <u>party</u>
waives the civil action, <u>reserves</u> <u>his</u> <u>right</u> <u>to</u> <u>institute</u>
<u>it</u> <u>separately</u>, or institutes the civil action prior to the
criminal action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Such civil action includes recovery of indemnity under the
Revised Penal Code, and damages under Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176 of the Civil
Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
arising from the same act or omission of the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A waiver of any of the civil actions extinguishes the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The institution of or the reservation of the
right to file any of said civil actions separately waives the others.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The reservation of the right to institute the separate civil
actions shall be made before the prosecution starts to present its evidence and
under circumstances affording the offended party a reasonable opportunity to
make such reservation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>In</u> <u>no</u> <u>case</u> <u>may</u> <u>the</u> <u>offended</u>
<u>party</u> <u>recover</u> <u>damages</u> <u>twice</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u>
<u>act</u> <u>or</u> <u>omission</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>accused</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The filing of a separate civil
action for damages against the accused by the heirs of the deceased victim is
authorized under Article 33 of the Civil Code which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>33.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases of defamation, fraud, and physical
injuries, a civil action for damages, entirely separate and distinct from the
criminal action, may be brought by the injured party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such civil action shall proceed independently
of the criminal prosecution, and shall require only a preponderance of
evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The term "physical injuries" in Art.</span>
33 <span class="GramE">is</span> used in a generic sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It includes consummated, frustrated, or
attempted homicide (<span class="SpellE">Madeja</span> vs. Cruz, 126 SCRA 293,
cited in Vol. <span class="GramE">I, p. 62 Civil Code, 1990 Ed., by R.C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having reserved and filed in the Regional <span style="">Trial Court of Manila a separate civil action to recover the civil
liability of the accused arising from the crimes charged, the heirs of the
deceased Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span>, are precluded from
recovering damages in the criminal case against the accused, for they are not
entitled to recover damages twice for the same criminal act of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in
awarding to the heirs of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Jervoso</span> in the
criminal case P30<span class="GramE">,000</span> as civil indemnity for his death
despite their reservation to file a separate civil action for that
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals likewise
erred in affirming the award.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The second assignment of error raises a purely factual
issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether the evidence is
sufficient to convict the accused of homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That issue may not be reviewed by this Court in an appeal by <i>certiorari</i>
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, where only legal issues may be raised.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
