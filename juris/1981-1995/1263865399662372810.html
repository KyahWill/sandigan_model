				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The private respondent <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> filed a complaint for collection and damages
against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City alleging that in the course of their business
transactions of buying and selling fish, the petitioner borrowed from him an
amount of P35,000.00, evidenced by a receipt dated May 4, 1982, marked as
Exhibit D, reading as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 526.5pt; text-indent: 0in;"><st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">5/4/82</st1:date></p>

<blockquote>Received the amount of Thirty Five Thousand Cash from Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> on the day of <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date></blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 526.5pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE">Sgd</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff claimed that of this amount, only P20,000.00 had
been paid, leaving a balance of P15,000.00; that in August 1982, he and the
defendant agreed that the latter would grant him an exclusive right to purchase
the harvest of certain fishponds leased by Cruz in exchange for certain loan
accommodations; that pursuant thereto, <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>
delivered to Cruz various loans totaling P15,250.00, evidenced by four receipts
and an additional P4,000.00, the receipt of which had been lost; and that Cruz
failed to comply with his part of the agreement by refusing to deliver the
alleged harvest of the fishpond and the amount of his indebtedness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cruz denied having contracted any loan from <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of special defense, he alleged that he
was a lessee of several hectares of a fishpond owned by <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yabut</span> and that sometime in May 1982, he entered into
an agreement with <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> whereby the latter would
purchase (<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>) fish in certain areas of the
fishpond from May 1982 to <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="8">August 15,
 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also agreed that
immediately thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> would sublease (<span class="SpellE">bubuwisan</span>) the same fishpond for a period of one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruz admitted having received on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date>, the amount of P35,000.00
and on several occasions from <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="8">August
 15, 1982</st1:date>, to <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="9">September 30,
 1982</st1:date>, an aggregate amount of P15,250.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended however, that these amounts were
received by him not as loans but as consideration for their "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" agreement and payment for the sublease of the
fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added that it was the
private respondent who owed him money since <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>
still had unpaid rentals for the 10-month period that he had actually occupied
the fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruz also claimed that <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> owed him an additional P4,000.00 arising from
another purchase of fish from other areas of his leased fishpond.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a pre-trial conference held on <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1984</st1:date>, petitioner and private respondent entered
into the following partial stipulation of facts.</p>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plaintiff and defendant, through their respective counsel, during
the pre-trial <span style="">conference, agreed on the
following stipulation of facts:</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>1) That plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> entered into a contract of what is commonly called
as "<span class="SpellE">pakyawan</span>" with defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz on the fishes contained in a fishpond which
defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz was taking care of as lessee
from the owner Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>,
with a verbal contract for the sum of P28,000.00 <span style="">sometime in May 1982.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2) That because of the necessity, defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
Cruz at that time needed money, he requested plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> to advance the money of not only P28,000.00
but<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P35,000.00 in order that <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz could meet his obligation with the owner of the
fishpond in question, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3) That the amount of P35,000.00 as requested by defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz was in fact delivered by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> duly received by
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz, as<span style="">&nbsp; </span>evidenced by a receipt dated May 4, 1982,
duly signed by defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4) That pursuant to said contract of "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>,"
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>
was able to harvest the fishes contained in the fishpond administered by <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz in August 1982.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>5) Immediately thereafter the aforesaid harvest thereon, they
entered again on a verbal agreement whereby plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> and defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
Cruz had agreed that defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz will
sublease and had in fact <span style="">subleased the
fishpond of <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>
to the herein plaintiff for the amount of P28,000.00 for a period of one year
beginning August 15, 1982.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>6) That sometime on <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="6">June
 15, 1983</st1:date>, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>, who is the owner of the fishpond, took back the
subject matter of this <span style="">case from the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>7) That defendant <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> Cruz in
compliance with their verbal sublease agreement had received from the plaintiff
<span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> the
following sums of money:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">a) P8,000.00 on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="8">August 15,
 1982</st1:date> as evidenced by Annex "B" of the Complaint (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E);<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="2Q">b) the sum of P500.00 on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="9">September
 4, 1982</st1:date>, as evidenced by <span style="">Annex
"C" of the complaint (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F);</span><o:p></o:p></p>

"D" of the complaint (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G); and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">d) The sum of P3,750.00 on <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="9">September

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the private respondent claimed that aside from the
amounts of P35,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D), P8,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E), P500.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F),
P3,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G) and P3,750.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
H) mentioned in the partial stipulation of facts, he also delivered to the
petitioner P28,000.00, which constituted the consideration for their "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 526.5pt; text-indent: 0in;">SGD. LUCIO CRUZ</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> also claimed that he had paid
Cruz the amount of P4,000 but the receipt of which had been lost and denied
being indebted to the petitioner for P4,000 for the lease of other portions of
the fishpond.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, the petitioner testified that he entered into a
"<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" and sublease agreement with the
private respondent for a consideration of P28,000 for each transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of the P35,000 he received from the
private respondent on May 4, 1982, P28,000 covered full payment of their "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" agreement while the remaining P7,000
constituted the advance payment for their sublease agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner denied having received another
amount of P28,000 from <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> on <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended that the instrument dated <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
I) was executed to evidence their "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>"
agreement and to fix its duration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was corroborated by Sonny <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, who testified that
it was he who prepared the <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date>,
receipt of P35,000.00, P28.000 of which was payment for the "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" and the excess of P7,000.00 as advance for the
sublease.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court ruled in favor of the petitioner and ordered the
private respondent to pay the former the sum of P3,054.00 plus P1,000.00 as
litigation expenses and attorney's fees, and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> U.
Rosario, Jr. found that the transactions between the petitioner and the private
respondent were indeed "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" and
sublease agreements, each having a consideration of P28,000.00, for a
total<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of P56,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to these agreements, <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> paid Cruz P35,000.00 on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D);
P8,000.00 on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1982</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E); P500.00 on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F);
P3,000 on <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1982</st1:date>;
P3,750 on <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1982</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H) and P4,000.00 on an unspecified date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court noted an earlier admission of
the private respondent that on an unspecified date he received the sum of
P6,000.00 from the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
amount was credited to the petitioner and deducted from the total amount paid
by the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
one-year contract of sublease was pre?terminated two months short of the
stipulated period, the rentals were correspondingly reduced.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the decision of the trial court was reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court instead ordered the
petitioner to pay the private respondent the sum of P24,916.00 plus P1,500.00
as litigation expenses and attorney's fees, on the following justification:</p>

<blockquote>Exhibit "I" is very clear in its non-reference to the
transaction behind Exhibit "D." What only gives the semblance that
Exhibit "I" is an explanation of the transaction behind Exhibit
"D" are the oral testimonies given by the defendant and his two <span style="">witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, Exhibit "I" is very clear in its
language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, its tenor must not be
clouded by any <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence introduced by the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And with the tenor of Exhibit
"I" remaining unembellished, the conclusion that Exhibit
"D" is a mere tentative receipt becomes untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The trial court erred when it relied on the self-serving
testimonies of the defendant and his witness as against the receipts both
parties presented and adopted as their own exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As said before, Exhibit "I" is very
clear in its tenor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if it is really
the <span style="">intention of Exhibit "I"
to explain the contents of Exhibits "D", such manifestation or
intention is not found in the four corners of the former document.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court also found that the amounts of P35,000.00,
P8,000.00, P500.00, P3,000.00, P3,750.00 and P4,000.00 were not payments for
the "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" and sublease agreement but for
loans extended by <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> to Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also accepted <span class="SpellE">Salonga's</span>
claim that the amount of P28,000.00 was delivered to the petitioner on May 14,
1982, as payment on the "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" agreement
apart from the F35,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) that was paid on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it agreed that the amount of
P6,000.00 received by the private respondent from the petitioner should be
credited in favor of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is now before this Court, raising the following
issues:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public respondent
Court of Appeals gravely erred in (1) disregarding <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence to Exhibits "D" and "I" despite the fact that
these documents fall under the exceptions provided for in Sec. 7, Rule 130 of
the Rules of Court and thereby in (2) making a <span style="">sweeping conclusion that the transaction effected between the private
respondent and petitioner is one of contract of loan and not a contract of
lease.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming for the sake of
argument that exhibits "D" and “I” evidence separate transactions,
the latter document should be disregarded, the same not having been pleaded as
a cause of action.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
Stipulation of Facts entered into by the parties herein relative to their
executed transactions during the hearing of their case a quo, are binding upon
them and as well as, upon the public respondent?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Our ruling follows.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 130, Sec. 7, of the Revised Rules of Court provides:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>Sec. 7 <u>Evidence of Written Agreements</u>. - When the terms of
an agreement have been reduced to writing, it is to be considered as containing
all such terms, and therefore, there <span style="">can
be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence of the
terms of the agreement other than the contents of the writing, except in the
following cases:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">a) When a mistake or imperfection of the writing or its failure to
express the true intent and agreement of the parties, or the validity of the <span style="">agreement is put in issue by the pleadings;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">b) When there is an
intrinsic ambiguity in the writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">The term "agreement" includes wills.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for the rule is the presumption that when the parties
have reduced their agreement to writing, they have made such writing the only
repository and memorial of the truth, and whatever is not found in the writing
must be understood to have been waived or abandoned.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule, however, is not applicable in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 7, Rule 130 is predicated on the
existence of a document embodying the terms of an agreement, but Exhibit D does
not contain such an agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
only a receipt attesting to the fact that on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date>, the petitioner received from the private
respondent the amount of P35,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not and could have not been intended by the parties to be the sole memorial of
their agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
Exhibit D does not even mention the transaction that gave rise to its
issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, Exhibit D can only be
considered a casual memorandum of a transaction between the parties and an
acknowledgment of the receipt of money executed by the petitioner for the
private respondent's satisfaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
writing of this nature, as <span class="SpellE">Wigmore</span> observed is not
covered by the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule.</p>

<blockquote>A receipt - i.e. a written acknowledg­ment, handed by one party to
the other, of the manual custody of money or other personality - will in
general fall without the line of the rule; i.e. it is not intended to be an
exclusive memorial, and the facts may be shown irrespective of the terms of the
receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is because usually a
receipt is merely a written admission of a transaction independently existing,
and, like other admissions, is not conclusive.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>" was mentioned
only in Exhibit I, which also declared the petitioner's receipt of the amount
of P28,000.00 as consideration for the agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner and his witnesses testified to
show when and under what circumstances the amount of P28,000.00 was
received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their testimonies do not in
any way vary or contradict the terms of Exhibit I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Exhibit I is dated <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1982</st1:date>, it does not make any categorical
declaration that the amount of P28,000.00 stated therein<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was received by the petitioner on that same
date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That date may not therefore be
considered conclusive as to when the amount of P28,000.00 was actually
received.</p>

<blockquote>A deed is not conclusive evidence of everything it may
contain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, it is not the only
evidence of the date of its execution, nor its omission of a consideration <span style="">conclusive evidence that none passed, nor is
its acknowledgment of a particular consideration an objection to other proof of
other and consistent considerations; and, by analogy, the acknowledgement in a
deed is not conclusive of the fact.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A distinction should be made between a statement of fact
expressed in the instrument and the terms of the contractual act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former may be varied by <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence but not the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 7 of Rule 130 clearly refers to the terms of an agreement and provides
that "there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest,
no evidence of the <u>terms of the agreement</u> other than the contents of the
writing."</p>

<p class="BODY">The statement in Exhibit I of the petitioner's receipt of the
P28,000.00 is just a statement of fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a mere acknowledgment of the distinct act of payment made by the
private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its reference to the
amount of P28,000.00 as consideration of the "<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>"
contract does not make it part of the terms of their agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Parol</span> evidence may
therefore be introduced to explain Exhibit I, particularly with respect to the

that no objection was made by the private respondent when the petitioner

<p class="BODY">For failure of the private respondent to object to the evidence

<p class="BODY">We find that it was error for the Court of Appeals to disregard
the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence introduced by the petitioner and
to conclude that the amount of P35,000.00 received on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date> by the petitioner was in the nature of

their sublease agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim that

not pleaded as a cause of action and was objected to by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to Rule 10 of the Rules of Court:</p>

necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues
may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but
failure to amend does not affect the result of the trial of these issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If evidence is objected to at the trial on
the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court
may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the
presentation of the merits of the action will be <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>
thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission
of such evidence would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon
the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may grant a
