<p class="BODY">Just before and immediately after the February 1986 revolution in 
the country, the position of Department-Chief of the Aquaculture Department, 
SEAFDEC, was held by Dr. Alfredo C. Santiago, Jr.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. Santiago was 
prevailed upon to withdraw as Chief of the Aquaculture Department and to 
surrender his office to the petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>By a letter dated 
<st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="4">8 April 1986</st1:date>, the Minister of 
Agriculture and Food, acting "by authority of the President", nominated the 
petitioner as Chief of the Aquaculture Department of SEAFDEC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> This recommendation was immediately 
transmitted to the Secretary-General of SEAFDEC, who holds office in 
<st1:place><st1:city>Bangkok</st1:city>, 
<st1:country-region>Thailand</st1:country-region></st1:place>.</p>
<p class="BODY">By an urgent telex dated <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="4">8 
April 1986</st1:date> addressed to the petitioner, the Secretary-General of 
SEAFDEC acknowledged receipt of the petitioner's "nomination by the President of 
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> 
as new Chief for the SEAFDEC AQD".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The 
Secretary General advised the petitioner, in the same telex, that pending 
Council approval of his nomination, the petitioner was requested "to serve as 
[Officer-in-charge] for AQD effective today" and was authorized "to take 
necessary actions to ensure orderly transfer of power in both administration and 
finance".</p>
<p class="BODY">By another telex dated <st1:date year="1986" day="11" month="4">11 
April 1986</st1:date>, the Secretary General advised the petitioner that the 
Secretariat had received the favorable vote of a majority of the members of the 
Council, and that, consequently, under Article 7 (2) of the Agreement 
Establishing the SEAFDEC, "the appointment of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Flor</span> 
J. <span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span> as AQD Chief [had been] approved by 
SEAFDEC Council".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> It appears that the 
Council was not then in session and we assume that the members were canvassed by 
telephone, telex or other comparable means and their votes obtained or 
transmitted by the same means.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">By a letter dated 13 June 1986, the Secretary General formally 
advised the SEAFDEC Council Director for Japan (and presumably the Council 
Directors for the other member countries) that "the Secretariat has received a 
unanimous vote for the appointment of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Flor</span> J. 
<span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span> as Chief of the SEAFDEC Aquaculture 
Department effective 8 April 1986, for a period of two years, as recommended by 
the government of the Republic of the Philippines".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the petitioner entered upon the discharge of the 
functions and duties of Chief of the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC and 
continued to do so from early April 1986 until about 21 November 1986.</p>
<p class="BODY">On or about 21 November 1986, while Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span> was in Tokyo, Japan attending the annual SEAFDEC 
Council meeting, the respondent, attended by groups of retainers and assistants, 
entered and took physical possession of the different offices of the Aquaculture 
Department, SEAFDEC, <em>i.e.</em>, its Manila Liaison Office, its Research 
Stations in <span class="SpellE">Binangonan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tigbauan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leganes</span>, as well as its Iloilo Liaison Office.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Having physically occupied the office of the Aquaculture Department, the 
respondent instantly undertook to exercise the functions of the 
Department-Chief, and in the process took immediate control of all purchases and 
payments, stopped the issuance of checks, recalled all motor vehicles assigned 
to various officers and agencies of the Department, immediately terminated the 
services of all consultants of the Department and put his own followers in 
charge of the various sections and agencies of the Department.</p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioner and other previously appointed or designated 
Aquaculture Department Officers and employees protested and have opposed and 
resisted the respondent's assertion of power and physical occupation of the 
Aquaculture Department by the respondent and his followers who have refused to 
vacate the offices and stations they have physically occupied.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="11">25 November 
1986</st1:date>, immediately upon his return from 
<st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span> filed in this Court a sworn Petition for <em>Quo 
Warranto</em> with prayer for preliminary injunction dated <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="11">24 November 1986</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon 
of 26 November 1986, the petitioner filed an urgent <em>ex-parte</em> motion for 
a temporary restraining order, stating that that morning, he had been served 
with summons issued by Judge <span class="SpellE">Eutropio</span> <span class="SpellE">Migriño</span> of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Branch 151, in Civil Case No. 54091 entitled 
"<em>Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center — Aquaculture Department et 
al., vs. Flor J. Lacanilao</em>," together with a restraining order issued by 
the same judge purporting to restrain the petitioner from discharging the 
functions and exercising the privileges pertaining to the office of the Chief of 
the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC, disbursing funds of the Aquaculture 
Department, using any of its facilities and vehicles and otherwise acting in his 
capacity of Chief of the Aquaculture Department.</p>
<p class="BODY">On 27 November 1986, we issued a temporary restraining order 
enjoining Judge <span class="SpellE">Migriño</span> from proceeding with Civil 
Case No. 54091 of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, 
Branch 151, and from implementing and enforcing his restraining order issued in 
the said civil case, and further restraining the respondent Capt. Juan de Leon 
from assuming and/or continuing to exercise the functions of the office of the 
Chief of the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC, from intimidating the officers and 
personnel of the SEAFDEC, in particular the use of armed men in such 
intimidation, and from occupying and otherwise intervening in the functions and 
activities of the Aquaculture Department.</p>
<p class="BODY">In his Comment filed on 18 December 1986 on the Petition for 
<em>Quo Warranto</em> in accordance with the resolution of this Court, the 
respondent claims that he is entitled to the office of Chief of the Aquaculture 
Department, SEAFDEC, by reason of a recommendation in his favor embodied in a 
letter dated 12 November 1986 signed by the Vice President and Minister for 
Foreign Affairs and addressed to the Secretary-General of SEAFDEC. This letter 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"The Government of the Republic of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> is 
pleased to submit the nomination of Juan A. de Leon as Chief of the Aquaculture 
Department of SEAFDEC for a two-year term vice Dr. <span class="SpellE">Flor</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This nomination is being submitted for consideration in the annual 
meeting of the SEAFDEC Council of Directors scheduled in 
<st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city> next week in accordance with 
Article 10 of the SEAFDEC Agreement.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The term of Mr. de Leon shall take effect on <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1986</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">Copies of this letter were apparently 
sent to the SEAFDEC Council Directors for 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Malaysia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Singapore</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Thailand</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
<p class="BODY">In another letter also dated 12 November 1986, addressed to the 
respondent, the Vice President and Minister for Foreign Affairs advised him that 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">has</span> approved your nomination as Chief of 
the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center 
(SEAFDEC) for a term of two years starting <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1986</st1:date>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In accordance with established procedure of the SEAFDEC nomination, 
this Ministry has advised the Secretary-General of SEAFDEC regarding your 
nomination.</blockquote>
<blockquote>You are, therefore, directed to assume the foregoing position 
effective <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="11">November 21, 
1986</st1:date>, and to request, for this purpose, the assistance of government 
offices and agencies concerned."</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">It was under cover of this letter that 
the respondent, about nine days later, launched his physical occupation of the 
office of the Chief of the Aquaculture Department, with all the planning and 
dispatch of a military campaign.</p>
<p class="BODY">The receipt of the <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="11">12 
November 1986</st1:date> nomination of the respondent as Chief of the 
Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC, caused consternation in the SEAFDEC Council 
meeting in <st1:city><st1:place>Tokyo</st1:place></st1:city>, where Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span> was present.<span>&nbsp; </span>Objections were raised 
and the Council refrained from acting on the respondent's nomination.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The formal response of the SEAFDEC Council is embodied in a letter dated 
<st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="11">21 November 1986</st1:date> addressed 
by Mr. K. Kimura, Chairman of the SEAFDEC Council of Directors, to Mr. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Malig</span>, Council Director 
for the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>:</p>
<blockquote>"I have the <span class="SpellE">honour</span> to refer to the 
Secretary-General's letter of 18 November 1986 informing the Council Directors 
that the Vice President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Government of 
the Philippines has officially submitted, by his letter of 12 November 1986, the 
nomination of Mr. Juan A. De Leon as Chief of the Aquaculture Department, 
effective 21 November 1986.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In this connection, you have mentioned to the Council Members that 
neither the President of the Philippines nor the Minister of Agriculture and 
Food have withdrawn support for Dr. F.J. <span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span>, 
appointed by the Council for a two-year term effective 8 April 1986, as Chief of 
AQD.</blockquote>
<blockquote>I therefore would like to convey to you the unanimous agreement of 
the Council Members asking you to seek further clarification on this matter and 
inform SEAFDEC Council accordingly.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">We note from this letter that the SEAFDEC 
Council of Directors has <em>not</em> approved the nomination of respondent as 
Chief of the Aquaculture Department. So far as the records of this case in this 
Court show, the SEAFDEC Council has not taken any further action on such 
nomination.</p>
<p class="BODY">The recommendation in favor of the respondent must be regarded as 
legally ineffective for the fundamental reason that there existed no vacancy to 
which the respondent could be nominated by the Government of the Republic of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> and 
to which the respondent could be appointed by the SEAFDEC Council.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Notwithstanding the insinuations of the respondent, we have no doubt that 
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lacanilao</span> was lawfully entitled to hold the 
position of the Chief of the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC, as of 21 November 
1986 when the respondent and his assistants and retainers <span class="SpellE">introjected</span> themselves in the offices of the Aquaculture 
Department.<span>&nbsp; </span>Until the tenure of the petitioner is lawfully 
terminated in accordance with the laws and regulations governing such tenure, no 
nomination for the same position can be approved and given effect.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It is clear that the nomination of the respondent for a position then 
lawfully filled in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement Establishing 
the SEAFDEC, did not have the effect of removing or otherwise terminating the 
two-year term of the petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <em>power to appoint</em> 
having been vested by Article 6 of the SEAFDEC Agreement in the Council, the 
<em>power to remove</em> must likewise be deemed lodged in the Council, and not 
in the nominating member-government.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is worth noting that under 
Article 6 (2) of the Agreement, <em>the power to appoint </em>the 
Department-Chiefs and the Deputy Department-Chiefs <em>cannot</em> be delegated 
by the Council to the Secretary-General.<span>&nbsp; </span>It follows, under the 
present terms of the SEAFDEC Agreement, that the <em>power to remove </em>cannot 
similarly be delegated to the Secretary-General.</p>
<p class="BODY">It has been suggested by the respondent that a nomination by the 
Government of the Republic of the Philippines to the office of the Chief of the 
Aquaculture Department should be regarded as equivalent to an appointment to 
such position, upon the ground that "by established diplomatic procedure (sic), 
<em>the appointment to be made by the SEAFDEC Council</em> based on such 
nomination or recommendation <em>would be merely ministerial as the 
Council</em>, again by force of international procedure (sic) <em>could not 
override or reject such nomination</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This suggestion of the respondent is 
bereft of any basis in the Agreement Establishing the SEAFDEC and indeed flies 
in the face of Article 10 (2) of that Agreement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Under Article 10 
(2) of the Agreement, two distinct acts are essential for a Department-Chief to 
be lawfully entitled to his position as such:<span>&nbsp; </span>the 
<em>recommendation</em> of the government of the member country in whose 
territory the department is located; and the <em>appointment</em> to such 
position by the SEAFDEC Council.<span>&nbsp; </span>The recommendation by the 
government of the member country must be accepted by the Council; a 
Department-Chief must be acceptable to both the host government and the Council 
of the SEAFDEC.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it be assumed that the SEAFDEC Council has in 
the past uniformly accepted the recommendations of the government of the host 
member country, that circumstance assuredly does <em>not</em> mean that the 
SEAFDEC Council cannot, under its constitutional document, reject such a 
recommendation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither can it be supposed that the recommendation 
by the government of the host member country, by itself and without more, would 
be sufficient to vest lawful title to the office concerned.<span>&nbsp; </span>It 
follows that the recommendation dated <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="11">12 November 1986</st1:date> in favor of the respondent cannot, in and 
of itself, be regarded as lawfully authorizing him to assume the office of the 
Chief of the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC, and to exclude the petitioner from 
that same office.</p>
<p class="BODY">We hold, accordingly, that the petitioner is entitled to the 
position of Chief of the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC, for the duration of 
his term or until that term is otherwise ended conformably with applicable law, 
including applicable regulations of the SEAFDEC.</p>
<p class="BODY">The respondent also argues that the position of Chief of the 
Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC, is not a "public office" and therefore not a 
proper subject of inquiry in a <em>quo warranto</em> proceeding.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The respondent further asserts that the Aquaculture Department, SEAFDEC, 
is not a corporation and that the office of the Chief of the Aquaculture 
Department is not therefore a corporate position.<span>&nbsp; </span>These arguments 
need not detain us for long.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary for us here to 
determine the precise nature of the position of Chief of the Aquaculture 
Department, SEAFDEC.<span>&nbsp; </span>The SEAFDEC exhibits some of the features of 
an intergovernmental organization, albeit of a fairly rudimentary type.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thus, the position of the Chief of the Aquaculture Department may be 
assimilated to a position within an intergovernmental organization.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>There appears nothing to prevent the petitioner, as the lawful holder of 
an office within an international organization having offices within the 
territory of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
from seeking the assistance of the courts of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> in 
protecting his right to such office against the pretensions of the respondent. 
The respondent himself sought the assistance of the Regional Trial Court, 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, 
Branch 151, by filing a complaint for injunction and damages, in attempting to 
prevent the petitioner from continuing to exercise the rights and 
responsibilities attaching to the position of Chief of the Aquaculture 
Department.<span>&nbsp; </span>In his complaint for injunction, the respondent made 
allegations entirely analogous to those made in petitioner's <em>Quo 
Warranto</em> petition:<span>&nbsp; </span>his own right to the office, and the 
defendant's (petitioner herein) lack of right to the same office.</p>
<p class="BODY">We would note, finally, that the present petition relates to a 
controversy between two claimants to the same position; this is not a 
controversy between the SEAFDEC on the one hand, and an officer or employee, or 
a person claiming to be an officer or employee, of the SEAFDEC, on the other 
hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is before us no question involving immunity from the 
jurisdiction of the Court, there being no plea for such immunity whether by or 
on behalf of SEAFDEC, or by an official of SEAFDEC with the consent of 
SEAFDEC.</p>
<p class="BODY">The present controversy has created considerable confusion and 
anxiety among the officers and employees of the Aquaculture Department and 
threatens the <span class="SpellE">paralization</span> of the important 
activities, and dissipation of funds and assets, of that Department.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This controversy should be resolved forthwith.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the 
exercise of the broad jurisdiction of this Court and in the interest of prompt 
and substantial justice, we treat the petition in this case as a petition for 
injunction, the respondent's comment as his answer thereto and dispose of the 
case accordingly.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the respondent is hereby enjoined from assuming 
the position and from <span class="GramE">discharging,</span> or continuing to

<p class="BODY" align="justify">I wish to add briefly that under the Rule of Law, 
the Court is called upon to intervene and adjudicate the conflicting claims to 
the same position between the parties, as prayed for by petitioner.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Where petitioner was duly nominated by authority of the President for the 
position of Department Chief of the Aquaculture Department of the SEAFDEC with 
offices located in the Philippines and was appointed thereto for a two-year term 
by unanimous vote of the SEAFDEC Council of Directors, while respondent did not 
have such nomination and appointment, it behooved respondent <em>not</em> to 
take the law into his own hands and forcibly occupy the different offices of 
SEAFDEC AQD at a time when petitioner was discharging his official duties in 
Tokyo, Japan, attending the annual SEAFDEC Council Meeting there.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It is time that the martial law regime's legacy of the law of force be 
discarded and that there be a return to the force and rule of law.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Respondent's recourse, if he felt entitled to the office, was to exhaust 
his administrative remedies with the proper Philippine authorities, and if not 
satisfied therewith, to <span>go </span>to court to assert his alleged 
rights.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent's unilateral taking over of the office and then 
going to the lower court one day after the filing in this Court of petitioner's 
petition and securing therein a restraining order against petitioner cannot be 
sanctioned under the Rule of Law.<br><br></p></div>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the following observations.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">I subscribe to the position that the prerogative 
writ of <em>quo warranto</em> would not lie to determine who between the 
competing parties should occupy the Office of the Chief of the Aquaculture 
Department, SEAFDEC, the <span>said </span>office not being a public office in 
the Republic of the Philippines or an office in a corporation created by 
authority of Philippine law.<span>&nbsp; </span>The determination of such matter lies 
within the prerogative of the SEAFDEC Council.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the facts 
of the case show that the Philippine Government was advised on April 11, 1986 by 
the Secretary General of SEAFDEC that the appointment of the petitioner as AQD 
Chief had been approved by the SEAFDEC Council.<span>&nbsp; </span>Until that 
appointment is revoked or changed by SEAFDEC and properly notified to the 
Philippine Government, the petitioner is entitled to be protected by the 
Philippine authorities, including the courts, from being disturbed in the lawful 
exercise of his functions as AQD Chief of SEAFDEC.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, the 
action of this Court is merely to grant an injunctive relief and should not be 
viewed as an encroachment upon the undisputed prerogative of the SEAFDEC Council 
to appoint the Chief of the Aquaculture Department which is located in the 
Philippines.<br></p>

<p class="BODY" align="justify">I am not persuaded that we have jurisdiction in this 
petition for <em>quo warranto</em> over the disputed office which is clearly not 
a public office in the Republic of the Philippines.<span>&nbsp; </span>It seems to me 
that the matter comes under the authority of the Southeast Asian Fisheries 
Development Center — which is not even a party in this case — to which the 
disputed office pertains.<span>&nbsp; </span>The fact that the persons claiming the 
same are both Philippine citizens cannot divest the SEAFDEC of such authority, 
especially if we consider that it is this body that has the power to appoint and 
dismiss its officials, as the majority opinion emphasizes.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
ruling on this dispute, we may be encroaching on a prerogative of the 
SEAFDEC.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">The letter of the SEAFDEC Council quoted in full in 
the majority opinion says little and proves nothing, being cautiously 
non-committal pending clarification of the cur<span>rent conflict.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>There is no suggestion in it that the SEAFDEC cannot resolve the conflict 
or that it is in any way surrendering its right to do so in the future.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>I read the letter to simply mean that it is asking for more 
informa</span>tion — specifically, the position of our government on the muddled 
situation —<span>as a </span>possible basis for the resolution of the matter by 
the SEAFDEC itself.<span>&nbsp; </span>As for the information sought, that is 
something that can come not from this Court but from the execu<span>t</span>ive 
department after it shall have settled what appears to be a disagreement between 
two of its ministries.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">The majority opinion observes that the SEAFDEC "has 
not approved the nomination of the respondent," as if to suggest that the 
SEAFDEC has disapproved it.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it could also be 
asserted that the SEAFDEC has not yet approved such nomination pending the 
clarification it seeks (and not from us).<span>&nbsp; </span>In any event, the 
question is in my view not for this Court to decide, at least at this time, if 
we are to manifest, a becoming respect for an international organization to 
which <span>we </span>have accorded the hospitality of our territory.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>I submit that such hospi<span>tality does not include interfering in the 
internal affairs of the SEAFDEC, whatever our feelings on the merits of the 
</span>present case.<o:smarttagtype namespaceuri="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" name="place"></o:smarttagtype></p>
