aside the decision of the trial court which declared the private respondents as
absolute owners of the property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in </span>dispute
and which ordered the petitioners, among others, to vacate the property and
remove the improvements thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Moreno
de Jesus and Emilio Moreno filed an action for quieting of title and recovery
of possession with damages against the petitioners Antonio <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Villanueva </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">and </span><span class="SpellE">Ligaya</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabarubias</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their complaint, the private respondents
alleged that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">they are two (2) of the
four (4) children of the late spouses <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Moreno
and Rosa <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> who</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> both </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">died intestate in 1945 and 1972 respectively; that said deceased
spouses during their lifetime were absolute owners and possessors of the parcel
of land </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">question; that since their father's death
until 1973, the private respondents took possession and control of the
property, exercising all rights of ownership thereon and were in actual, open,
continuous, adverse and notorious possession of the same in the concept of
owners; that sometime in October 1966, the petitioners were given permission to
reside and stay on the middle eastern portion of the land and since then up to
the present have been in possession thereof; that subsequently, petitioners
claimed the whole property as thei<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">r</span>s
to the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">exclusion
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of the respondents and their
co-heirs; and that petitioners, aside from exercising acts of possession and
ownership thereto adverse to the respondents, even sold a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">portion </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of the same property to several persons in utter deprivation of
respondents’ rights and interests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners filed their answer with compulsory counterclaim
and as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">special </span>and affirmative
defenses, alleged, among others, that the complaint states no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">cause of action as the portion which they
were cultivating was sold by the private respondents’ two other sisters on
installment basis to the petitioners who paid the amount of P5,755.00 with the
balance of P2,245.00 still remaining and that this portion of the lot occupied
by the petitioners was subsequently sold by them to their second cousin <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Villanueva who trusted the petitioners, so much
so that he bought the land without asking the document of ownership, and paid
the amount </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P2,000.00 to petitioner Antonio Villanueva.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After both parties had presented their evidence, the trial court
made the following findings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>facts:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Antonio Villanueva (the
petitioner) is a second degree cousin of <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Villanueva, who are both farmers of a parcel of land owned by <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Moreno, bounded on the north by public highways;
on the east by Fernando <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Esteban, on the south by Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> Esteban and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">on
the </span>west by <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> Cruz and mountain which
is a natural boundary;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parcel of land
tenanted by Antonio Villanueva, is situated in <span class="SpellE">Manipa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Castillejos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>,
wherein he and Socorro Moreno and Magdalena Moreno, (the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">private respondents’ two other sisters)
jointly administered the property in question;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As caretaker of the
property, Antonio Villanueva pleaded from the surviving heirs of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Moreno that he will pay by installment a portion
of the property which he is occupying in the sum of ten thousand pesos<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(P10,000.00);<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Antonio Villanueva made installment
in the amount of P5,755.000, but still is indebted to the plaintiffs
(respondents) in the amount of P2,245.00, although the purchase price was
allegedly reduced from ten thousand <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P10,000.00)
to eight thousand (P8,000.00) pesos;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That</span>
Antonio Villanueva took possession of the property and by his manipulation, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he </span>sold the same property to <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Villanueva for two thousand pesos, P2,000.00) <span class="SpellE">notwithstandinhg</span> the fact that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">had not completed the installment payment to respondents;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Antonio Villanueva was charged in
court under <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 2537 for the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> for selling the property to <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Florentino</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> Villanueva.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio Villanueva, in fact, was convicted by this court on January 30,
1978 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Criminal Case No. 2537 for the said crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, for which he was sentenced to suffer imprisonment
of four (4) months of </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

indemnity to the offended party in </span>the sum of P2,000.00 by way of civil
liability<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> and the costs of the
proceedings; and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

(private respondents) are <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">
</span>owners and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">possessors of the
subject property and together with the two (2) other sisters and </span>their
predecessors in interest had been in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">open,
actual, continuous, notorious and </span>adverse possession in the concept of
owners, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(respondents) allowed the
defendants </span>(petitioners) to stay and occupy a portion of the subject
property as tenants.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Based on the above findings, the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">accordingly ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The sole issue to be determined in the case at bar is whether
or not the plaintiffs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and their two (2)
other co-heirs are the </span>absolute owners of the property left by their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">late father <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span>
Moreno.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Reassessing the situation as it now stands, and taking into
consideration the various tax declarations issued in the name of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the plaintiffs and their co-heirs and tax
receipts for which they had been paying the </span>land and realty taxes in the
concept of an owner, the Court is of the opinion and so holds that the defendants
have no legal right t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">o claim ownership
of the whole subject property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
first place, the defendant Antonio Villanueva is still indebted to the
plaintiffs in the amount of Two Thousand Two Hundred Forty Five Pesos (P2<span class="GramE">,245.00</span>) and it is undeniable that the title to the property
has not yet passed to him nor had he that right to dispose of the same knowing
fully well that the land was encumbered at the time of the disposal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Antonio Moreno (sic) was a mere
tenant at the time and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">such </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">being the </span>case, his occupation of the
property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(sic) </span>and legal basis
to claim the whole of the property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">involved
in this litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

defendants by overwhelming preponderance of evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1984</st1:date>,
the counsel for petitioners filed an "Explanation <span class="GramE">And</span>

court's resolution dismissing the petitioners' appeal was discovered by the
secretary of the counsel only on <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="1">January

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1984</st1:date>,
the petitioners, through their counsel, filed a "Notice of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>Appeal" before this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said notice, the petitioners sought to
justify the filing of their "intended petition for review" by stating
that "[p]<span class="SpellE">urely</span> questions of law specifically on
jurisdiction deserve <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

submitted<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> on time were meritorious
enough to far outweigh </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
technicality that the Court (IAC) lost jurisdiction over the case." And
thus, they contended that the "acts of the Appellate Court (IAC) amounted
to grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1984</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed an "Appellants' Petition" assailing the trial
court's (not the <span class="GramE">Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Appeals'</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

assignments of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>IN THE CALIBRATION OF THE TOTALITY OF
PROFFERED EVIDENCES, THE TRIAL COURT ERRED BY MISAPPREHENSION OF EVIDENCE AND
IT HAS PLAINLY OVERLOOKED CERTAIN FACTS OF SUBSTANCE AND VALUE, THAT IF
CONSIDERED MIGHT AFFECT RESULT OF CASE.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, the petitioners had a change of mind in that while in
their "Notice of Appeal, they alleged grave abuse of discretion on the
part of the appellate court for dismissing the appeal, in their present
petition, petitioners opted to attack the decision of the trial court on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">basis </span>of
alleged misapprehension of facts and law.</p>

<p class="BODY">This procedure adopted by the petitioners is highly irregular, to
say the least, for instead of dealing with the issue of the propriety of the
appellate court's <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">dismissing </span>the
appeal for their failure to file an appellants' brief and to seasonably move<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>to reconsider such dismissal, they
chose to file what seems to be a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules
of Court, assailing instead, the decision of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the petitioners want this Court to focus its attention
more on the decision of the trial court rather than the resolutions of the
appellate court which should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">have </span>been
the subject of the instant petition in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the petitioners wanted to appeal before
this Court on a petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court from
the decision of <u>the</u> <u>trial</u> <u>court</u>, they may have been
allowed to do so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">on </span>a showing of
a meritorious petition, but in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">such
case, </span>they could only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">raise
questions of </span>law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See also
Philippine National Bank v. <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>, Jr., 139 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">320)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, if the petitioners intended to assail the
decision or resolution of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">the</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><u>appellate</u> <u>court</u>, they
should have filed either a petition for review under Rule 45 raising questions

under Rule 65 on the ground of grave abuse of discretion or acts in excess of
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the petitioners cannot
choose to appeal before the appellate court and then, because of their
counsel's own negligence, evade the consequence of a dismissal of said appeal
by trying to file a petition for review with this Court assailing this time the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">decision of the trial </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>To <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">add to the confusion,

Petition" and with "<span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> Moreno de Jesus,
et al., (Plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>) v. Antonio Villanueva,
et al., (Defendant-Appellants)" as parties, the petitioners filed a
"Notice of Appeal" (a pleading not required when filing a petition
before this Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also made the Intermediate
Appellate Court as one of the respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In said notice, it was alleged that the appellate court committed grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These procedural maneuvers whether purposely
resorted to in order to sow confusion or simply the product of ignorance of
counsel cannot be countenanced by this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot pass upon the issues raised in this petition because
the proper forum for the same is lodged with the appellate court which has
jurisdiction to decide questions of facts and law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if we do decide to pass upon the merits
of this case and disregard this procedural defect, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">t</span>he petition itself, which is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

difficult to comprehend the facts surrounding the case without relying on the
decision of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not
to mention the fact, and it can be readily seen, that the petition was actually
the "Appellants' Brief" which was filed by the petitioners below as
defendant-appellants which explains why the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the parties as "plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>" and
"defendant-appellant."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The counsel for petitioners did not even bother to change the
