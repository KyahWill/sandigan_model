Salvador dela Cruz and Rodrigo Taoc were charged with the crime of robbery with
homicide before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 52, Virac, Catanduanes,
allegedly committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 22nd day of August, 1987 at more or less
7:30 o'clock in the evening, at barangay Inalmasinan, municipality of
Caramoran, province of Catanduanes, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and
helping one another for a common purpose, did then and there, willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously by means of violence and intimidation forcibly enter
the house and store of one Pastor Verano, Sr. and once inside, willfully, unlawfully
and feloniously, with intent to gain and against the consent of said owner
Pastor Verano, Sr., take, steal and carry away, Ten Thousand Pesos
(P10,000.00), Philippine Currency to the damage and prejudice of his heirs in
the said sum; that on the occasion of the robbery and for the purpose of
enabling them to take, steal, and carry away the above mentioned amount, herein
accused in pursuance of their conspiracy, did then and there, willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously and with evident premeditation and taking advantage
of their superior number and strength as a band, and with intent to kill,
treacherously attack, assault, sho(o)t and use personal violence upon the
persons of Pastor Verano, Sr. and Pastor Verano, <span style="">Jr. </span>who were fatally wounded which resulted to their instant
death, and during the struggle Jesus Tapanan, a member of the said band was
also killed.</blockquote>

unlicensed firearm.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Three of the accused, Juan Tañote, Salvador dela Cruz and Rodrigo
Taoc, initially pleaded not guilty but, upon re-arraignment, pleaded guilty to
the offense charged.  Herein appellant
Salvador Torrente was not apprehended and remained at large.  Considering, however, the gravity of the
offense, the trial court ordered the prosecution to present its evidence
against the accused in custody.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 22, 1988, the trial court rendered judgment finding the

wise:</p>

<blockquote>"In the light of all the foregoing, the Court finds all three
accused JUAN TAÑOTE, SALVADOR DELA CRUZ and RODRIGO TAOC guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Homicide, with the aggravating circumstance

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1990, appellant was eventually arrested in
Manila.  Upon arraignment with the
assistance of counsel, he pleaded not guilty.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> On

<p class="BODY">The People's version of the factual antecedents of this case is presented
in this Counter-Statement of Facts in the brief filed by the Solicitor General,
with page references to the transcript of the stenographic notes taken at the
trial of this case:</p>

<blockquote>"About 7:00 o'clock in the evening of August 22, 1987, Pastor
Verano, Sr. and his wife, Nery Verano, were preparing to take their dinner at
their residence at Inalmasinan, Caramoran, Catanduanes.  With them were Lilia Braga and Pastor
Verano, Jr., both children of Verano, Sr. by his first marriage.  Verano, Jr. came in order to get some money
for his trip abroad (TSN, October 14, 1991, pp. 5-6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That same evening, at a house adjoining the compound of the
Veranos, Miguel Solero, a farmer, was preparing to bring some splitted rattan
to Verano, Sr., who regularly bought his (Solero's) rattan.  About 7:00 o'clock P.M., Solero reached the
residence of the Veranos where they had a store, but was prevented from
entering the gate by Rodrigo Taoc, who poked a gun at him (Solero) and <span style="">told him not to shout.  Appellant stood beside Taoc, holding a
flashlight.  Solero recognized appellant
for he had stayed with Solero at his hut in Maycamagong, Maraubos for a week,
sometime in July, 1987 while gathering rattan.  Nearby, Juan Tañote, Salvador dela Cruz, and Jesus Tapanan stood by the
main door of the Veranos' store.  When
Tañote, dela Cruz and Tapanan began pushing the front door of the store, Taoc
and appellant left Solero who went towards the house of Dioscoro ­Clavano
nearby, and told Clavano and his companion, Domingo Burac, that the Veranos
were being robbed (TSN, August 30, 1991, pp. 35-41, 45-­46, 50-55).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Alarmed by the barking of dogs and the commotion outside,
Verano, Sr. opened the kitchen door, went to their adjoining store and got a
flashlight.  Thereafter, he went to the
sala and opened the main door of the house.  He heard<span style=""> somebody say,
'hold-up.' The same was also heard by Nery Verano and Verano, Jr. who stood
(up) from the dining table at the kitchen and proceeded towards the door to the
sala.  They saw Verano, Sr. being held
by Jesus Tapanan and Salvador dela </span>Cruz.  Before Nery Verano and Verano, Jr. were able to enter the sala to
assist Verano, <span style="">Sr., </span>they were
stopped by Juan Tañote who entered the house through the kitchen door, and
threatened them with a gun.  Then, a
shot <span style="">was </span>heard coming from the
sala.  Seeing that his father was
bleeding, Verano, <span style="">Jr. </span>struggled
with Juan Tañote, enabling Nery Verano to run back to the kitchen.  Then two gunshots were heard coming from
where Verano, Jr. was, and Nery Verano saw Verano, Jr., slum(p) to the
floor.  Before Nery Verano could hide in
the kitchen, appellant came through the door and poked a gun at her (TSN,
October 14, 1991, pp. 7-11, 2-23; Exh. 'F,' p. 184 of Record).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Jesus Tapanan, who
was severely wounded during the fray, was brought outside the house by </span>Juan
Tañote and Salvador de la Cruz.  Thereat, Tapanan subsequently died.  After that, Juan Tañote returned to the kitchen where Verano, <span style="">Jr.'s </span>fallen body was and fired at
it.  After appellant and his companions
had fled, Nery Verano saw that her husband and stepson were dead.  She also found that the sales for the day in
the sum of P500.00, which was kept in a locker at the store, and the P10,000.00
for Verano, Jr.'s trip, were gone (Exh. 'E-3,' p. 188 of Record:  TSN, October 14, 1991, pp. 11-13, 18-23).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"In the morning of the
following day, August 23, 1987, Francisco Padayao, a farmer of Inalmasinan, was
at his hut by the river in Maraubos, Iraya, splitting rattan.  With him were his common-law wife, Conchita Padayao,
Junior Torrente and his wife, Jovita, and Juan Torrente.  At around 5:30 a.m., Rodrigo Taoc arrived at
Francisco Padayao's hut.  About twenty
minutes after, appellant, Salvador dela Cruz and Juan Tañote also arrived at
Francisco Padayao's hut.  Appellant
asked for some food from Francisco </span>Padayao and the latter gave him
some.  While appellant's group was
eating by the edge of the river, Francisco Padayao observed that Salvador de la
Cruz' hand was dripping with blood.  Padayao also saw that appellant had two guns, one was a long firearm
while the shorter one was tucked on his left waist.  After eating, Padayao overheard appellant and Juan Tañote say
that their trip was unlucky.  Appellant
said, ‘never mind, if our trip is (sic) unlucky, we got two and we lost one,’
while gesturing by running his forefinger across his neck from right to
left.  Thereafter, about <span style="">7:30 A.M., the group prepared to leave.  Before leaving, appellant told Padayao not
to tell anyone that they had passed by (TSN, August 30, 1991, pp. 5-12).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Padayao's group went back to Inalmasinan on August 24, 1987
and learned that Verano, Sr. and Verano, Jr. were killed two days earlier.  At 6:30 o'clock that evening, Francisco
Padayao went to the wake of the Veranos and told Nery Verano about the four (4)
men who passed by his hut in Maraubos (TSN, August 30, 1991, pp. 30-a, 30).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The bodies of Verano, Sr. and Verano, Jr. were autopsied by
Dr. Santelices.  In his medico-legal
report dated August 26, 1987, he found that Verano, Sr. died of 'C-R arrest,
exsanguinating hemorrhage gunshot and stabbed (sic) wounds, chest' (Exh. 'A'
and 'A-2', p. 30 of Record), while Verano, Jr.'s death was due to 'C-R arrest,
exsanguinating hemorrhage, gunshot wound, head' (Exh. 'B' and 'B-2', p. 32 of
Record).  (TSN, August 30, 1991, pp.
2-3; TSN, October 14, 1991, pp. 28-29)."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On his part, appellant interposed the defense of alibi and
mistaken identity.  He claims that he
could not have been one of the perpetrators because on August 22, 1987, when
the alleged incident took place, he was in the forest of Maraubos gathering
rattan, together with his wife and daughter and several other persons, namely,
Francisco Padayao and his common-law wife, Conchita; Jose Torrente, Jr. and his
wife, Jovita; Juan Torrente and his wife, Vilma; and Pio Torrente and his wife,
Shirley.  They stayed in that place from
August 13, 1987 until August 25, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 25, 1987, appellant went home to Coripdas, San Miguel,
Catanduanes.  On August 27, 1987, he and
his wife went to Mulanay, Quezon after receiving a telegram, informing them of
the death of his father-in-law.  Appellant stayed in Quezon for five months and thereafter went to Manila
where he worked in a construction firm.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further testified that sometime in June, 1991, Mrs.
Verano went to the Provincial Jail and, upon seeing him, commented that
"he seems not to be the person." This fact was corroborated by the
testimony of the jail guard, Leo Tatel.</p>

<p class="BODY">A thorough review of the records convinces us that a judgment of
conviction is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assigned errors hinge on the issue of credibility.  The Court cannot detach this case from the
settled rule that when the issue of credibility of witnesses is involved, the
appellate court will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court considering
that the latter is in a better position to decide the question, having heard
the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner <span style="">of </span>testifying during the trial, unless
certain facts of value have been plainly overlooked which, if considered, might
affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully scrutinized the evidence of record to ferret
out any possible bases for misperception or oversight on the part of the court
below but we have found none.  Indeed,
there is no reason to doubt the identification of appellant by the prosecution
witness.  Contrary to his claim, the
identification was positive and unmistakable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Nery Verano, the wife of one of the victims, gave this
testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
you said you went towards the kitchen, where you able to reach the kitchen?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why were you not able to
reach the kitchen?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not reach the
kitchen, because another man with a gun entered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
did that man enter?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
man passed thru the kitchen door.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PROSECUTOR</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
the way, was your kitchen lighted?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
kind of lamp or light?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pressure
lamp (Petromax).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
when you met that man with a gun as you were going to the door of your kitchen,
what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
man poked his gun at me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
then, what did you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
went to the place where we cooked.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could
you recognize that man who poked that gun at you while you were going to the
kitchen door?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will
you please look around and tell us if that man is present in court?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(Witness
pointing to accused Salvador Torrente)."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The relationship of this witness with the victim does not
discredit her testimony.  On the
contrary, the fact that the principal witness is the victim's wife even lends
more credence to her testimony as her natural interest in securing the
conviction of the guilty would deter her from implicating persons other than
the culprits for, otherwise, the latter would thereby <span style="">gain </span>immunity.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant would also like to make capital of the alleged
inconsistency between the description of the assailant given by the victim's
wife in her sworn statement and his actual physical features.  He claims that the witness described the
assailant as one with curly hair and of regular build, whereas appellant stands
5 feet and 1 inch tall and has straight hair.  The supposed inconsistency is more apparent than real.</p>

<p class="BODY">A person who measures a little above 5 feet is customarily
considered as being of a normal and average height for a Filipino.  The slight change in hairstyle, which could actually
be varied as often as one desires, is of negligible effect when viewed against
the positive identification of herein appellant as one of the malefactors who
committed the crime, obviously by reason of his facial features and appearance
which are indisputably the most common and ordinarily reliable means of
ascertaining identity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was also identified by the other prosecution witness,
Miguel Solero, who declared that:</p>

<blockquote>"PROSECUTOR</blockquote>

point to him?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Miguel Solero could not have been mistaken.  He already knew appellant even prior to the
time of the incident, since appellant had even stayed in his hut in Maycamagong
for one week while gathering rattan.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of appellant that the behavior of Miguel Solero in
not telling anybody about the incident is not in accord with the common
experience and observation of mankind, hence it seriously impairs his
credibility, is decidedly bereft of merit.  Pertinent portions of his testimony reveal that he actually told Domingo
Burac and Dioscoro Clavano about what happened.  Thus, he testified as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The credibility of Miguel Solero and Nery Verano is further enhanced
by the fact that these eyewitnesses had no ill feelings against appellant.  When the witness does not appear to be
biased against the accused, his or her assertions as to the identity of the
malefactor should be given full faith and credence.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the ill motives imputed by herein appellant to the other
prosecution witnesses, that is, Francisco Padayao and his <span style="">common-law wife, Conchita, even if true is
inconsequential considering that their testimonies are merely corroborative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also worth noting at this point that Rodrigo Taoc, a
co-accused of herein appellant executed an affidavit before the Philippine
Constabulary wherein he categorically named appellant as one of the
perpetrators of the crime charged.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Evidently, in the face of these established facts, appellant's defense of alibi
cannot succeed.  It is well settled that
alibi cannot prevail over the positive testimony of prosecution witnesses and
their clear identification of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, appellant failed to show that it <span style="">was </span>physically impossible for him to
be at the Verano residence at the time the crime was perpetrated.  It is elementary that for alibi to be
believed, credible and tangible proof of physical impossibility for the accused
to be at the scene of the crime is indispensable.  In its absence, the defense of alibi cannot be sustained.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Alibi <span style="">is admittedly and consistently
considered the weakest defense an accused can concoct.  In order to prosper, it </span><span style="">must </span><span style="">be so convincing as to preclude any doubt that the accused could not
have been </span>physically present at the place of the crime or its vicinity
at the time of its commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, appellant's
flight is a clear and positive indication of his guilt.  His claim that he left Catanduanes solely
for the purpose of attending the burial of his father-in-law, is not worthy of
belief.  He stayed away from Catanduanes
for three years until his arrest in 1990.  Despite the fact, that he is a farmer, instead of going back to
Catanduanes he went to Manila to work as a construction worker.  In addition, he left Catanduanes immediately
after the arrest of his co-accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-entrenched doctrine that an accused's flight from
the scene of the crime and his act of hiding himself until he was arrested are
circumstances highly indicative of his guilt, for, as has long been wisely
said, the wicked flee even when no man pursueth but the righteous are as bold
as a lion.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
We cannot perceive how appellant can be exempted from that verity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty prescribed for the special complex crime of robbery
with homicide is <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering, however, that at the time of the commission of the offense the
imposition of the death penalty was proscribed,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> the
trial court was correct in meting out only the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>
notwithstanding the aggravating circumstances attending the commission of the
crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, consonant with our present jurisprudential policy, the
death indemnity to be awarded to the heirs of each of the victims should be
increased from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00, or the total sum of P100,000.00.  Considering that the judgment against Juan
Tañote, Salvador dela Cruz and Rodrigo Taoc, the other convicted felons, had
become final and executory as of February 28, 1991,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
they are solidarily liable with Salvador Torrente only up to the amount awarded
and for which they have been held liable in the said decision.  Any amount in excess of said prior award is
the sole liability of appellant Salvador Torrente.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the appealed decision is hereby <span style="">AFFIRMED, </span>with the modification that
the civil indemnity for the death of each of the victims is increased to
P50,000.00, or the total sum of P100,000.00 for both.  Accused-appellant Salvador Torrente shall be jointly and
severally liable with his three co-accused for P60,000.00 of said amount, and
for the remaining P40,000.00 he shall be exclusively liable.</p>
