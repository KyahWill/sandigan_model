dated February 5, 1988 denying a motion for reconsideration of its earlier
decision on the ground that the appeal of petitioner was filed way out of time,
<u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., 51 days from notice of the decision of the Regional Trial
Court (Branch 160) of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1983</st1:date>,
private respondent William Samara filed Civil Case No. 50248 entitled
"William Samara, plaintiff, versus <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span>
Banking Corporation and Marine Midland Bank, NA, defendants" before Branch
160 of the Regional Trial Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint alleged that private respondent purchased a
US$40,000.00 demand draft from petitioner <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span>
Banking Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span>) and that he invested
the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt"> </span>same in a joint venture with
a certain Tony Mancuso for the purpose of bringing to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
some American entertainers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The draft
was drawn against Marine Midland bank, NA (Marine Midland) in favor of Thai
International Airways since the amount represented the estimated cost of the
air transportation of the entertainers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sensing, however, that Tony Mancuso was not going to fulfill his part <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the agreement, private respondent
executed a stop-payment order on <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="12">December
 23, 1980</st1:date> and gave specific instructions to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> to immediately telex the same to its
correspondent bank in <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Marine Midland.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both defendants
confirmed that the demand draft was not yet paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span>
re-credited the dollar account of the private respondent in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>amount of US$40,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after a lapse of seven (7) months,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> debited the said dollar account
in the amount of $40,000.00 upon realizing that Marine <st1:city><st1:place>Midland</st1:place></st1:city>
had debited the amount of $40,000.00 from the account of <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent filed a protest regarding
the debiting of his dollar account and demanded the return of the said amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint further alleged that Tony Mancuso arrived in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in January 1981 and stayed in the country up to the middle part of the same
year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent went on to say
that he did not bother to collect from Mancuso the value of the bank draft
inasmuch as Mancuso assured him that the same was never <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent also alleged that Mancuso
had, since then, left the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for an unknown destination thereby making it impossible to go after him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed an answer with counterclaim and cross claim on <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1984</st1:date> while Marine Midland
filed its counterclaim and <span class="SpellE">crossclaim</span> on <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1986</st1:date>,
the Regional Trial Court held Marine Midland and <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span>
jointly and severally liable to private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the decision of the trial court reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Ordering
the defendants, jointly an severally, to pay the sum of $40,000.00, plus twelve
percent (12%) interest per annum from July 3, 1981, until full payment is made,
and the further interest of 12% per annum on the accrued interest from December
23, 1980, up to the filing of the complaint on October 4, 1983, inclusive;
exemplary damages in the sum of P100,000.00 and the sum of P50,000.00 as
attorney's and costs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Dismissing
the defendants' counterclaims for lack of merit;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner avers that on <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="3">March
 26, 1986</st1:date> or nine days after it received a copy of the said
decision, it was furnished a copy of the motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">for </span>reconsideration filed by Marine Midland seeking a reversal
of the decision of the lower court against both itself and petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Marine Midland pointed out that
the cause of action of the private respondent is not really against any of the
defendant banks but against Tony Mancuso and that the only reason why the case
was filed against the defendants is because "Mancuso is nowhere to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">be </span>found and the plaintiff is left
holding the proverbial empty bag."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On account of the failure of the petitioner to appeal during the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period allowed for the same, private
respondent filed a motion for execution of the decision of the lower court on <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed an opposition thereto on <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioner received a copy of the order of the lower court denying the motion
for reconsideration of Marine <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Midland.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>This prompted the former to file a
Notice of Appeal on <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1986</st1:date>,
or two days after the said order was received.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court, however, denied the appeal filed by petitioner and
granted the motion for execution filed by private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then filed a motion for
reconsideration which was, however, granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court gave due course to the appeal on the ground that
"substantial justice demands the granting of the motion at bar."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

The trial court also set aside the order of execution on the ground that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"the denial of the appeal and the giving
of due course to the execution of the judgment as against said defendant at
this point in time will work out an unjust situation as it will be conducive to
force the defendant <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> to satisfy the judgment
without being able to demand and be defrayed reimbursement from co-defendant
Marine Midland as mandated in the decision appealed from, until the disposition
of the case on appeal by the Intermediate Appellate Court who (sic) may either
affirm or reverse the decision."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">This Court finds the
petition bereft of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that when Marine Midland filed a motion for
reconsideration, it was intended to benefit both Marine Midland and
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner explained that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">motion sought the reversal of the decision of
the lower court not only with respect to the judgment against Marine Midland
but also as regards the liability of petitioner on the ground that the person
who should be held liable is Tony Mancuso who, at present, is nowhere to be
found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner cites <u>Director </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that the two defendants, Marine Midland and <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span>, filed cross claims against each other in their
answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span>
alleged that the proximate cause of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
injury should be attributed to co-defendant Marine Midland when the latter
failed to promptly inform <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> </span>that the
demand draft <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> issued was really paid by
Marine Midland on <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For its part, Marine Midland alleged that <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> did not properly advise it of the actual
circumstances relating to the dates of payment of the draft and of the receipt
by the latter of the stop-payment instructions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rights and liabilities of both parties concerned are not so
interwoven in such a manner that their defenses are similar and that a reversal
of the judgment as to one should operate as a reversal to the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, a perusal of the decision appealed
from shows that Marine Midland, though jointly and severally liable with
petitioner, is the one ultimately held responsible for the damages incurred by
the private respondent inasmuch as the trial court ordered "defendant
Marine Midland to reimburse defendant <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> of
whatever amount the latter will be made to pay the plaintiff by reason of this
judgment and costs."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Another factor negating the theory of the petitioner is the fact that both
parties are represented by different counsels such that one cannot legally act
for the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, when Marine
Midland filed its motion for reconsideration, it was acting for itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has often been said that "dismissal of appeals on purely
technical grounds is frowned upon, where the policy of the courts is to
encourage hearings of appeals on their merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid,
technical sense; rules of procedure are used only to help secure, not override
substantial justice."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

this Court enumerated the grounds for the allowance of an appeal filed out of
time, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., fraud, accident, mistake or excusable
negligence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, petitioner
did not state any reason for its failure to file its appeal within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner did not even allege the existence of circumstances that would
amount to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable neglect so<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>as to provide a legal justification
for its late appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the circumstances of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
case snow the weakness of the claim of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the said case, the appellant filed a
motion for new <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">trial </span>which did
not set forth specifically the reasons in support of said ground and was,
therefore, found to be <u>pro</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> <u>f</u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">orma</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence, the motion did
not suspend the running of the period to appeal, and the appeal filed more than
thirty days from notice was not given due course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the
</span>present case, petitioner did not do anything upon receipt of the
decision of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It simply
waited for the result of the motion filed by its co-defendant Marine Midland, a
situation worse than that in <u>Reyes</u>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the issue of whether or not private respondent is
entitled to the immediate execution of the decision of the trial court, the
answer should be in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court provides that "(e)<span class="SpellE">xecution</span> shall issue only upon a judgment or order that
finally disposes of the action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such execution
shall issue as a matter of right upon the expiration of the period to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> if no appeal has been duly perfected."
Having failed to appeal during the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, the decision of the Regional <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Tr</span>ia<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">l </span>Court against petitioner had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> against petitioner thereby making
it the ministerial duty of the trial court to grant the motion for execution
filed by the prevailing party.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument of the petitioner to the effect that execution
should not be allowed during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
appeal of its co-defendant inasmuch as the same would result in an absurd
situation in case the findings of the trial court are reversed by the Court of
Appeals, has no leg to stand on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law
is clear and admits of no other interpretation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A final judgment must be executed against the defeated party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the Regional Trial Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">held </span>the two defendants <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">j</span>ointly
and severally liable to the plaintiff</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, whether or not Marine Midland is absolved from liability <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>appeal is of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that the judgment against <span class="SpellE">Citytrust</span> had already become<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt"> </span>final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there is no valid ground for the trial
court to deny the motion for execution filed by private respondent at this
point in time.</p>
