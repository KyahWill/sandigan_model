<p class="BODY">Upon request of counsel for the defense, the proceedings on the 
hearing on the petition for bail were consolidated with and treated as part of 
the trial on the merits.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>At this hearing on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="8"><span>21 August 1975</span></st1:date><span>, the prosecution 
presented Abraham <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> and Rebecca Acosta, both 
residents of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lawis</span> and neighbors of the 
deceased spouses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Briefly, <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span> testimony 
disclosed that at around seven o'clock in the evening of 17 April 1975, he 
noticed that <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span> were at their hut 
situated </span>along the northern bank of the <span class="SpellE">Lawis</span> 
Creek cooking salt (<em>i.e.</em>, evaporating sea water), an activity which the 
couple regularly carried out at least once every week.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometime 
between ten o'clock and midnight of that same evening, while he was on his way 
back to his hut, <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> heard a man's agonizing voice 
scream "Oh my lord, they are killing us" coming from the direction of where the 
<span class="SpellE">Abobons</span> were cooking salt.<span>&nbsp; </span>He proceeded 
towards the source of the screams, taking care to conceal himself, until he was 
approximately 25 to 30 meters away from the <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span> 
hut, where he saw the whole incident take place.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Malong</span> from his hiding place watched in horror as the 
bolo-wielding trio of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, Julio and their 
unidentified companion assaulted and hacked away at the defenseless couple and, 
after their deadly mission had been accomplished, fled toward the northeast in 
the general direction of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> hut.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Malong</span> was so filled with fear by what he had 
just witnessed that, except for his wife, he told no one else about it until 
after the passage of ten days.<span>&nbsp; </span>During this period, he stayed home, 
feeling ill.<span>&nbsp; </span>More importantly, <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> 
testified that he recognized both accused as two of the assailants because it 
was a bright and moonlit night and their faces were further illuminated by the 
light from a lamp hanging outside the deceased’s hut and from the flames heating 
the ovens (<span class="SpellE"><em>kawa</em></span>) used by the luckless spouses 
in cooking salt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">For her part, Rebecca Acosta testified at the <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="8">21 August 1975</st1:date> hearing that at 
approximately <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">eleven o'clock</st1:time> of that 
fateful evening, she was asleep inside her hut when she was suddenly awakened by 
an "agonized voice" which twice screamed "<em>Ay katawan ay</em>", accompanied 
<span>by </span>the barking of dogs.<span>&nbsp; </span>She then got up and peered 
outside her window, and there she saw three men on the other side of the creek 
clad only in shorts (<span class="SpellE"><em>carsunsillo</em></span>), and 
wielding <span class="SpellE">boloes</span>, hurriedly running away from the 
general area where the <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span> hut was situated.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Although she <span>was </span>approximately 70 meters away, she asserted 
that she was able to identify positively <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> and 
Julio as two of the men she saw hurrying away, for the same reasons given by 
<span class="SpellE">Malong</span> — <em>i.e.</em>, it was a bright and moonlit 
night, and a clear view was further afforded by the light from a nearby lamp and 
by the flames from the four ovens on which the spouses were cooking salt.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>She further testified that, as to the motive behind the slayings, father 
and <span>son </span>were driven by their vengeful desire to rid themselves of 
the <span class="SpellE">Abobons</span> whom they believed to be "witches" whose 
"witchcraft" had brought about the death of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio's</span> 
son and the idiocy of his grandson.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">Describing the testimonies of the two prosecution witnesses as 
"incredible" and "unbelievable" and noting "inconsistencies" between their 
statements, Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> granted the petition for bail 
in a resolution issued on <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="8"><span>25 
August 1975</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, Norma <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span>, a daughter of the deceased, urged in a "Motion 
<em>Ex-Parte</em> for Inhibition" that Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> 
had prejudged the case and was hence not capable of rendering an impartial 
decision therein.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> while rejecting Norma <span class="SpellE">Abobon's</span> assertion nevertheless inhibited himself and the 
case was once more re-raffled to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of Judge 
<span class="SpellE">Magat</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Upon arraignment on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="3"><span>30 March 1976</span></st1:date><span>, both accused entered a

THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">In their brief, appellants focus much attention on the separate 
testimonies of Abraham <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Acosta, presenting in lengthy excerpts several 
alleged inconsistencies in the effort to impeach the credibility of those 
witnesses.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>With </span><span>respect to <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, appellants contend that several inconsistencies 
pervaded the separate statements which he gave on 21 August 1975 at the hearing 
of the petition for bail, and on 21 and 26 July 1976 at </span><span>the regular 
trial, the most notable of which were:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) </span><span>although 
<span class="SpellE">Malong</span> earlier claimed that he positioned himself in a 
place 25 to 30 meters away from where the killings took place, he later 
testified that he was just 7 to 8 meters away at his <span class="SpellE">saltbed</span> when he witnessed the incident; and (b) in his 
previous statement, he had claimed that </span><span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Abobon</span> was screaming "Oh my lord, they are killing 
us", however, a year later he changed this to "<span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz are killing us" — a definitely more precise and 
incriminating version.<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, since the incident supposedly 
took place at around midnight, and considering that he allegedly viewed the 
killings from "across a 4 to 5 meter creek along both sides of which grow all 
kinds of bushes and trees", the appellants urge that <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> could not have possibly seen, much less identified, 
them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Finally, drawing attention to the fact that the children of 
the slain spouses were close neighbors of <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, and 
in view of his assertion that his alleged presence at the scene of the crime was 
neither noticed nor detected by the perpetrators thereof, appellants question 
why it took this witness all of ten <span>days </span>before he reported the 
killings to the authorities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such silence, appellants claim, was 
"highly unnatural" and indicative of fabrication and falsity.</p>
<p class="BODY">We are unable to agree with the accused-appellants’ 
contentions.</p>
<p class="BODY">A careful examination of the record discloses that the supposed 
"inconsistency" regarding the exact distance from which <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> viewed the killings is not properly attributed to the 
witness himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the first statement this witness gave on 
<st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="4">27 April 1975</st1:date> to Sgt. Romeo 
B. <span class="SpellE">Colet</span> of the Philippine Constabulary investigating 
unit, the following question-and-answer sequence is found:</p>
<blockquote>"Q:<span>&nbsp; </span>How far were you at the time that you claimed to 
have seen and/or witnessed this incident?</blockquote>
<blockquote>"A:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From this place where I am now standing up to 
that place where the post is standing.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Affiant 
pointing <span>an </span>approximate distance of about 25 to 30 meters.)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>It thus appears that the approximation of "25 to 30 meters" 
was actually given by PC Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Colet</span> (or by some third 
person), and not by the witness, so that when <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> 
was later asked during the hearing on the petition for bail to estimate the 
distance from which he had witnessed the slaying, he simply repeated Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Colet's</span> (or the third person's) estimation of the same, 
which he must have presumed to be correct.<span>&nbsp; </span>The record also shows 
that at the trial on 21 July 1976 <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> was again 
asked t</span><span>o </span><span>indicate the distance at which he viewed the 
killings </span><span>by </span><span>referring to an object some distance away, 
which was then estimated by the trial court and </span><span>by 
</span><span>both counsel for the prosecution and for the defense to 
</span><span>be </span><span>7 to 8 meters away from the witness stand.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Thus, the "inconsistency" 
arose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>From the foregoing, it is far from clear that <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> was responsible for whatever discrepancy arose in 
respect of this particular matter.<span>&nbsp; </span>Being a simple farmer and <span class="SpellE">saltmaker</span>, he could not be expected to give an accurate 
</span><span>quantitative statement </span><span>of </span><span>how far he was 
from the scene of </span><span>the crime, and this is presumably why he was 
instead </span>requested to relate this distance to an object visible to the 
witness which then became the basis of the second approximation.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>But regardless of which of the two divergent estimates was (or is) more 
accurate, one thing remained constant in <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span> mind 
and testimony — the fact that he saw <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> and 
Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, along with their unidentified 
companion, hack to death <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The discrepancy regarding exactly what <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> heard <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span> scream is immaterial as it refers only to a 
relatively minor detail.<span>&nbsp; </span>Again, what is important is that <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> steadfastly testified he had witnessed the actual 
commission of the crime that evening and made positive identification of the 
perpetrators thereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even if we were to accept his first version 
over the second, this fact </span><span>will </span><span>not change and his 
testimony on this point was not successfully <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> and rebutted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The defense stresses heavily <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span> failure, for ten days after discovery of the crime, 
to report to anyone, save his wife, what he had seen.<span>&nbsp; </span>We do not 
believe that sinister implications must necessarily be drawn from such failure 
on the part of <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We tend to 
believe that his silence for ten days is not an unexpected reaction to the 
outrage which had taken place and which <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> was 
unfortunate enough to have witnessed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Simply put, <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> was frightened out of his wits.<span>&nbsp; </span>Barrio 
<span class="SpellE">Lawis</span> is a small place where everyone knows everyone 
else.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once he reported </span>what he had seen, the 
accused-appellants would sooner or later learn from whence the report 
came.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Malong</span> admitted in open court that 
he <span>was </span>not a particularly brave man, an admission not frequently 
made in today's world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, keeping in mind <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span> humble position in life, it is not difficult to see 
why it took time before he was able to gather his <span>wits </span>together and 
take his courage in hand and to report what he had witnessed to the 
authorities.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the very least, an ordinary human being who had 
witnessed the bloody slaying of the <span class="SpellE">Abobons</span> would have 
been as horrified and as apprehensive as <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> 
evidently was.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not a few might well have gotten ill over or become 
much disturbed <span>by </span>such a heinous murder and the implicit 
possibility of reprisal (from the unidentified third man, if not from the 
accused) that a formal report to the municipal authorities would commonly raise 
for one living, as <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> lived, in a small and remote 
barrio.<span>&nbsp; </span>Finally, it may be noted that <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, like most of the other witnesses, is not a highly 
educated person.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is doubtful whether he fully understood all 
the questions asked of him; he was candid enough to admit that he had not.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">In their defense, all that the appellants offered was the bare 
assertion that they were in their hut sleeping while the <span class="SpellE">Abobons</span> were attacked and slain.<span>&nbsp; </span>On their 
defense of alibi, it should suffice to note that appellants' hut <span>was 
</span>only 150 to 200 meters away from the <span class="SpellE"><span>saltbed</span></span><span> where the <span class="SpellE">Abobons</span> were <span class="SpellE">boloed</span> to death, a 
distance easily covered within minutes even by a leisurely walk.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Given these circumstances, the appellants' defense of alibi can scarcely 
be given much weight.<span>&nbsp; </span>"Alibi is one of the weakest defenses that 
can be resorted to by an accused", this Court has held,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> and "as a minimum requirement for the 
theory of alibi to be accepted, the accused must also demonstrate that it was 
physically impossible for him to be in the scene of the crime".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> "It is a well-settled rule," this Court 
has also said, "that against the positive identification of the accused, alibi 
is unavailing".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Where, as here, the 
tendered alibi is sought to be established exclusively by testimony of the 
accused themselves, especial caution must be exercised in accepting it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Another principal prosecution witness, <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Acosta, a stepson of <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span>, testified that

awakened, <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> peeped through the walls of his <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut and saw both <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> and 
Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="GramE">Cruz,</span> together 
with a man he had not seen before, hurriedly running away from the area where 
the couple were cooking salt towards the northeast, in the general direction of 
their own hut.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> and Rebecca 
Acosta, <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> testified that he was able to discern 
the faces of the accused because it was a moonlit night, and their figures were 
illuminated by the fire from the oven of the deceased and the light from a 
kerosene lamp hanging outside the latter's hut.</p>
<p class="BODY">In <span>seeking to </span>refute <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> 
Acosta's testimony, the defense calls our attention in their brief to the 
statements given by his wife, Rebecca Acosta, at the hearing of the "Petition to 
Bail" on <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="8">21 August 
1975</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>There Rebecca had stated that her husband, <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span>, was asleep when she had been awakened by the barking 
of dogs and that <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> was not awakened by the 
barking and the agonized screams.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">It may be noted at the outset that the defense refrained from 
presenting Rebecca Acosta /as a witness, albeit a hostile one, for the accused 
after <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Acosta had given his testimony.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The defense also refrained both from recalling Rebecca Acosta for further 
cross-examination after <span class="SpellE">Enrico's</span> testimony, and from 
cross examining <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> on the <span>basis </span>of 
Rebecca's statements during the hearing <span>of </span>the petition for 
bail.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can only assume that the defense did not consider 
Rebecca's testimony concerning her husband being "fast asleep" as important and 
material as it now contends it is.<span>&nbsp; </span>What appears to us as important 
is that <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> and Rebecca Acosta had each positively 
identified the accused <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> and Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, along with a yet unidentified third person, 
fleeing from the direction of the scene of the killings towards the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> hut.<span>&nbsp; </span>Equally important is the fact 
that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> as well as that of 
Rebecca corroborated the eye-witness testimony of <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> on the identity of the accused as the slayers of the 
<span class="SpellE">Abobon</span> spouses.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other words, if one 
must choose between the testimony of one and that of the other, the testimony of 
either <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> or Rebecca was sufficient corroboration 
of the testimony given by <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>We 
tend to believe that both <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> and Rebecca were 
awakened (though not necessarily at the same time) by the howling of the dogs 
and the screams of agony and peered fearfully at <span>the men </span>hurrying 
away.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are left to speculate why Rebecca stated that <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> was not awakened by the noise.<span>&nbsp; </span>But it 
is not necessary to rest our conclusion on this point upon speculation.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The trial judge found the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> 
Acosta to be worthy of credence.<span>&nbsp; </span>We do not believe that Rebecca's 
statement that <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> was fast asleep is sufficient, 
by itself and in the circumstances of this case, <span>to </span>overthrow the 
trial court's finding on this point.</p>
<p class="BODY">Regarding the other assigned errors, appellants aver the 
following:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) although there is no evidence on record to show 
that Judge <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> had in fact conducted an ocular 
inspection of the scene of the crime, he described the area as "open 
country",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> quite contrary to the scene 
depicted by the several picture exhibits (Exhibits "4" and series, to "8" and 
series) submitted in evidence by the defense, which "clearly show the thick 
foliage in the area along the creek where the crime was allegedly committed ... 
along which grow all kinds of trees including acacia trees"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>; (b) since it was consistently alleged 
that the killings took place sometime around midnight, "it cannot be bright 
since there is no evidence that it was a moonlit night"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>; (c) the oven fire "could not have 
sufficiently illumined the place to permit positive identification"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> of the defendants, or anyone else for 
that matter, as the culprits; and (d) the supposed motive of the accused was 
simply "provided"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> for by Judge <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>, who had already prejudged the case and was "bent [on] 
convict[<span class="SpellE">ing</span>]"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> the accused.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Exhibit "4" and Exhibit "7" do suggest that "thick foliage" 
and "all kinds of trees" abound in the fishpond <span>area where the 
</span>deceased's hut was located.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the plants and 
<span>trees referred to in said photographs have </span>not been shown to pose 
any obstruction to <span class="SpellE">Malong's</span> line of <span>vision 
between </span>the place from where he claims he viewed the <span>killings 
</span>and the spot where the <span class="SpellE">Abobons</span> were 
slain.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, Exhibit "5", a picture of the scene of the crime 
<span>which </span></span><span>was </span><span>evidently </span><span>taken 
from the general direction and area from where <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> 
said he had situated himself, and Exhibit "6", which shows from the obverse 
</span><span>side </span><span>the scene depicted in Exhibit "5", indicate that 
a clear and unobstructed view was afforded <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, 
such that recognition </span>and <span>identification of the defendants as the 
assailants of the couple were quite possible, as was precisely done by <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In respect of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses 
that the fatal night was a "bright and moonlit night", the defense presented as 
its witness </span><span>Mrs. </span><span>Elvira <span class="SpellE">Vinluan</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Oficer</span>-in-Charge of 
the PAGASA Weather Bureau at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span>Dagupan</span></span></st1:placename><span> 
</span><st1:placetype><span>City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Unfortunately, the testimony of this witness on direct examination was 
neither informative nor supportive of the appellants' 
case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the other hand, upon cross-examination, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Vinluan</span> testified that as far as 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span>Dagupan</span></span></st1:placename><span> 
</span><st1:placetype><span>City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span> was 
concerned, as per the Bureau's three-hourly observation check on the tragic 
evening of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="4"><span>17 April 
1975</span></st1:date><span>, the condition of the sky at ten minutes before 
</span><st1:time minute="0" hour="11"><span>eleven 
o'clock</span></st1:time><span> was clear, with the moon and the stars shining 
brightly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although she </span>did state that weather conditions in 
<st1:place>Labrador</st1:place> <em>could</em> have been different, she did not 
deny the possibility that the conditions therein could have in fact been 
similar, if not identical to those prevailing in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Vinluan</span> also could not state with certainty whether at that 
particular time the moon was high enough over <st1:place>Labrador</st1:place> to 
escape being covered by the mountains in the area (which mountains, it may be 
noted, are located south of the part of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lawis</span> 
where the killings took place).<span>&nbsp; </span>However, she agreed that from an 
area removed from the mountains, (<em>e.g.</em>, by the beach) the moon would 
still be visible.<span>&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, when asked whether at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> that evening the moon would have 
been "a little bit higher" in the <span>sky, </span>she answered, "It would be 
logical.<span class="GramE">",</span> implying that better visibility could have 
been afforded at such time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">On the question of the sufficiency of the light produced by the 
oven flames, appellants presented no evidence whatsoever to show that the ovens 
were not actually lit or, if lit, produced light too dim or insufficient for 
<span class="SpellE">Malong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> and/or 
Rebecca Acosta to see and identify the two defendants.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, 
they did not deny or contest the statement given by Rebecca Acosta that 
<em>four</em> ovens, and not just one, were utilized by the <span class="SpellE">Abobons</span> that night in cooking salt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">Mindful of the circumstances enumerated above, the trial court 
summed up:<o:p></o:p></p>
<blockquote>"...In fact, the night was <span class="GramE">bright,</span> there 
was even the fire that came from the ovens of the <span class="SpellE">Abobons</span> and that of Abraham <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">So that, the accused 
could not have been mistakenly identified by Abraham <span class="SpellE">Malong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Acosta."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">We see no reason to disturb these 
findings of the trial court.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="BODY">Coming now to the motive for the commission by the defendants of 
the crime charged, the same was not plucked out of thin air, as it were, by the 
trial judge.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court's finding on the motive for the crime 
rests on separate statements given by five witnesses (<span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Acosta, Rebecca Acosta, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span>, Norma <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span>, and Santiago 
<span class="SpellE">Resoso<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> all of whom 
testified that both Dionisio and Julio dela Cruz resented the Abobons, 
especially Emilia Abobon, for having allegedly caused the death of Dionisio's 
son and the feeblemindedness of Julio's only son, through sorcery and 
withcraft.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, both Enrico Acosta and Rogelio Abobon 
testified that in the afternoon of 17 April 1975 and on the previous day they 
had been approached </span>separately by the accused and warned that "something 
would happen" to <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emilia</span> <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span> if they did not 
cease their practice of "witchcraft".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><strong></strong> The defendants denied 
having made such ominous threats.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> The 
trial court was unable to accord substantive weight to such denials, in the face 
of the mutually corroborative and supportive testimony of the <span>prosecution 
witnesses.<span>&nbsp; </span>We </span>find no reversible error on the part of the 
trial court on this point.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Turning finally to the circumstances attending the 
commission of the offense charged<span class="GramE">,</span> treachery, having 
been alleged and proved, qualified the killing of the unfortunate spouses as 
murder.<span>&nbsp; </span>The circumstances of abuse of superior strength and <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> which were also proven at the <span class="GramE">trial,</span> are absorbed in treachery.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Evident premeditation, which was also 
alleged in the Information, might have been taken into account as a generic 
aggravating circumstance </span>had <span>it </span><span>been clearly 
proven.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court, however, did not make a specific finding 
of evident premeditation, correctly, in our view, since the evidence of record 
would not support such a finding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>So far as concerns <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, there being no mitigating nor aggravating 
circumstance properly </span><span>appreciable, the penalty of <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em> for each murder committed was correctly 
imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the case of Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, 
however, the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should have been 
appreciated in his favor by the trial court.<span>&nbsp; </span>The evidence of 
record shows that the accused Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, after 
the funeral of the <span class="SpellE">Abobon</span> spouses in Labrador, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, left Labrador and returned to San Miguel, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, where he had a 
job.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court construed the departure of Julio as a "flight 
to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span>Pasig</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal — to </span><span>evade the strong arm of the law which, by 
then, was catching up on him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, he could (sic) not have 
brought along his family with him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> 
The trial court did not indicate why the return of Julio to 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span>Pasig</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, constituted flight from justice.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
court also failed to indicate why it regarded Julio's bringing along his family 
with him to where he had been earning his livelihood as indicative of <span class="GramE">an intent</span> to evade the law. In any case, approximately four 
weeks later, having come to learn of the issuance of the warrant for the arrest 
of both his father and <span class="GramE">himself</span>, Julio came back to 
</span><st1:place><span>Labrador</span></st1:place><span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and, accompanied by his lawyer, went to the 
</span><st1:place><span>Labrador</span></st1:place><span> police authorities and 
presented himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence in the record to show that 
Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, before returning to 
</span><st1:place><span>Labrador</span></st1:place><span>, had actually been 
served with a copy of the warrant for his arrest, or that such warrant had been 
returned <span class="SpellE">unserved</span> for failure to locate <span class="GramE">him.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>In <em>People versus Braña</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> the Court held that the fact that the 
surrender is <span class="GramE">effected</span> sometime after issuance of the 
warrant of arrest does not detract from the voluntary character of the 
surrender, in the absence of proof to the contrary.<span>&nbsp; </span>The decision 
of the trial court went on to say that<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<blockquote>"Even if Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz were to [be] 
liberally considered as having legally surrendered, yet, <em>his penalty remains 
the same as that of his co-accused, Dionisio</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>dela</em></span><em> Cruz, there being fully established 
conspiracy</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span>Here, the trial court is in 
error.<span>&nbsp; </span>The fact that conspiracy is established does not mean that 
the penalty imposed upon one must be imposed upon the rest of the 
conspirators.<span>&nbsp; </span>Proof of conspiracy does not prevent the 
appreciation of a mitigating circumstance exclusively in respect of the 
co-conspirator to whom such circumstance may relate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, appreciating in 
favor of Julio <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz the mitigating circumstance 
of voluntary surrender without any generic aggravating circumstance to offset 
it, the correct penalty imposable upon him is the minimum period of the penalty 
for murder:<span>&nbsp; </span><em>i.e.,</em> <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its 
maximum period, for each murder.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></p>

Penal Code. </p><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> We cannot condone by 
passing <em>sub silentio</em> the extravagant language used by counsel for the 
defense <span>in </span>referring to the trial judge (Judge Romeo D. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>) and the manner in which the latter heard and decided 
the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>Defense counsel described Judge <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> as rationalizing "a judgment he knew to be wrong" 
(Appellants' Brief, p. 3).<span>&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> 
is further accused of convicting "for its (sic) own sake, the 
accused-appellants" (Appellants' Brief, p. 7) <span>and as "misrepresenting the 
evidence of the prosecution </span><span>by </span><span>making it appear 
strong" (Appellants' Brief, p. 9).<span>&nbsp; </span>Further down, defense counsel 
refers to Judge <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> as "a judge bent to convict" 
(Appellants' Brief, </span><span>p. </span><span>54).<span>&nbsp; 
</span></span>Finally, defense counsel charges Judge <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> with convicting the appellants to “satisfy (his) 
personal whims and caprices" (Appellants’ Brief, p. <span>60).<span>&nbsp; 
</span></span>The language used by defense counsel goes beyond the merely 
vigorous or exuberant expressions which, in a passionately fought courtroom 
battle, may well be overlooked.<span>&nbsp; </span>We refer here to language used in 
a brief which <span>is </span>presumably written after careful thought.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Judging from the appellants' brief and from the record of this case, the 
statements of defense counsel against Judge <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> were 
made without <span>basis </span>and hence deplorable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Epithets, 
whether directed at the judge or at the witnesses, have no place in proceedings, 
oral or written, before our courts. </st1:date></st1:date></st1:date></div>
