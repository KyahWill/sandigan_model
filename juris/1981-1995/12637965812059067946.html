<p class="BODY">On arraignment, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General states accurately the facts as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Khingsley</span> Paul <span class="SpellE">Koh</span>
and the wife of accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Abarca</span>, Jenny, had
illicit relationship. The illicit relationship apparently began while the
accused was in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> reviewing for
the 1983 bar examinations. His wife was left behind in their residence in <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
<span style="text-transform:uppercase">(PP. </span>45-47, 65, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Sept. 24, 1984).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On July 15, 1984, the accused was in his residence in <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>. On the morning
of that date he went to the bus station to go to Dolores, Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, to fetch his daughter. However, he was not able to
catch the first trip {in the morning]. He went back to the station in the
afternoon to take the 2:00 o'clock trip but the bus had engine trouble and
could not leave (pp. 5-8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Nov, 28, 1985). The
accused, then, proceeded to the residence of his father after which he went
home. He arrived at his residence at the V &amp; G Subdivision in <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City at around 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon (pp.
8-9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">id.</i>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon reaching home, the accused found his wife, Jenny, and <span class="SpellE">Khingsley</span> <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> in the act of
sexual intercourse. When the wife and <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> noticed the
accused, the wife pushed her paramour who got his revolver. The accused who was
then peeping above the built-in cabinet in their room jumped and ran away (pp.
9-13, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">id.</i>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused went to look for a firearm at <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>
City. He went to the house of a PC soldier, C2C Arturo <span class="SpellE">Talbo</span>,
arriving there at around 6:30 p.m. He got <span class="SpellE">Talbo's</span>
firearm, an M-16 rifle, and went back to his house at V &amp; G Subdivision. He
was not able to find his wife and <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> there. He proceeded
to the "mahjong session" as it was the "hangout" of
Kingsley <span class="SpellE">Koh</span>. The<sup> </sup>accused found <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> playing mahjong. He fired at Kingsley <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> three times with his rifle (pp. 13-19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">id.</i>).<span class="SpellE">Koh</span> was hit. Arnold and <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span> who were occupying a room adjacent to the room
where <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> was playing mahjong were also hit by the
shots fired by the accused (pp. 34-49, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Sept. 24,
1984). Kingsley <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> died instantaneously of <span class="SpellE">cardiorespiratory</span> arrest due to shock and hemorrhage as a
result of multiple gunshot wounds on the head, trunk and abdomen (pp<span style="text-transform:uppercase">. </span>28-29, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Sept. 24, 1984; see also <span class="SpellE">exh</span>. A): <st1:city><st1:place>Arnold</st1:place></st1:city>
<span class="SpellE">Amparado</span> was hospitalized and operated on in the
kidney to remove a bullet (pp. 17-23 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="10">Oct. 17, 1984</st1:date>; see also <span class="SpellE">exh</span>. C). His wife, <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span>, was also treated in, the hospital as she was hit
by bullet fragments (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">id.</i>). Arnold <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span> who received a
salary of nearly P1,000.00 a month was not able to work for 1-1/2 months
because of his wounds. He spent P15,000.00 for medical expenses while his wife
spent P1,000.00 for the same purpose (pp. 24-25, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">id.</i>).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

63 of the Revised Penal Code which does not consider the effect of mitigating
or aggravating circumstances when the law prescribes a single indivisible
penalty in relation to Art. 48, he is hereby sentenced to death, to indemnify

Paul <span class="SpellE">Koh</span> and defendant's wife had illicit
relationship while he was away in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>;
that the accused had been deceived, betrayed, disgraced and ruined by his
wife's infidelity which disturbed his reasoning faculties and deprived him of
the capacity to reflect upon his acts. Considering all these circumstances this
court believes the accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Abarca</span> is
deserving of executive clemency, not of full pardon but of a substantial if not
a radical reduction or commutation of his death sentence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General recommends that we apply Article 247 of the
Revised Penal Code defining death inflicted under exceptional circumstances,
completed with double frustrated murder. Article 247 reads in full:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 247. Death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional
circumstances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>-- Any legally married person who, having surprised his spouse in
the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person, shall kill any of
them or both of them in the act or immediately thereafter, or shall inflict
upon them any serious physical injury, shall suffer the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">destierro</i></span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If he shall inflict upon them physical injuries of any other kind,
he shall be exempt from punishment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These rules shall be applicable, under the same circumstances, to parents
with respect to their daughters under eighteen years of age, and their
seducers, while the daughters are living with their parents.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Any person who shall promote or facilitate prostitution of his wife
or daughter, or shall otherwise have consented to the infidelity of the other
spouse, shall not be entitled to the benefits of this article.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision applies in the instant case. There is no question that the accused
surprised his wife and her paramour, the victim in this case, in the act of
illicit copulation, as a result <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>which,
he went out to kill the deceased in a fit of, passionate outburst Article 247
prescribes the following elements: (1} that a legally married person surprises
his spouse in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person; and
(2} that he kills any of them or both of them in the act or immediately
thereafter. These elements are present in this case. The trial court, in
convicting the accused-appellant of murder, therefore erred.</p>

<p class="BODY">Though quite a length of time, about one hour, had passed between
the time the accused-appellant discovered his wife having sexual intercourse
with the victim, and the time the latter was actually shot, the shooting must
be understood to be the continuation of the pursuit of the victim by the
accused-appellant. The Revised Penal Code, in requiring that the accused
"shall kill any of them or both of them... immediately" after
surprising his spouse in the act of intercourse, does not say that he should
commit the killing instantly thereafter. It only requires that the death paused
be the proximate result of the outrage overwhelming the accused after chancing
upon his spouse in the basest act of infidelity. But the killing should have
been actually motivated by the same blind impulse, and must not have been
influenced by external factors. The killing must be the direct byproduct of the
<span class="SpellE">accused's</span> rage.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stressed furthermore that Article 247, supra, does not
define an offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In People v. <span class="SpellE">Araquel</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
we said:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>As may readily be seen from its provisions and its place in the
Code, the above-quoted article, far from defining a felony, merely provides or
grants a privilege or benefit -amounting practically to an exemption from an
adequate punishment - to a legally married person or parent who shall surprise
his spouse or daughter in the act of committing sexual intercourse with
another, and shall kill .any or both of them in the act or immediately
thereafter, or shall inflict upon them any serious physical injury. Thus, in.
case of death or serious physical injuries, considering the enormous
provocation and his righteous indignation, the accused - who would otherwise be
criminally liable for the crime of homicide, parricide, murder, or serious
physical injury, as the case, may be - is punished only with <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">destierro</i></span>. This
penalty is mere banishment and, as held in a case, is intended more for the
protection of the accused than a punishment. (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Coricor</span>,
79 Phil., 672.) And where physical injuries other than serious are inflicted,
the offender is exempted from punishment. In effect, therefore Article 247, or
the exceptional circumstances mentioned therein, amount to an exempting
circumstance, for even where death or serious physical injuries is inflicted,
the penalty is so greatly lowered as to result to no punishment at all. A
different interpretation, i.e., that it defines and penalizes a distinct crime,
would make the exceptional circumstances which practically exempt the accused
from criminal liability integral elements of the offense, and thereby compel
the prosecuting officer to plead, and, incidentally, admit them, in the
information. Such an interpretation would be illogical if not absurd, since a
mitigating and much less an exempting circumstance cannot be an integral
element of the crime charged. Only "acts or omissions… constituting the
offense" should be pleaded in a complaint or information, and a
circumstance which mitigates criminal liability or exempts the accused <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, not being an essential element of the offense
charged - but a matter of defense that must be proved to the satisfaction of
the court - need not be pleaded. (Sec. 5, Rule 106, Rules of Court; U.S. vs.
Campo, 23 Phil., 368.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the article in question defines no crime is made more manifest
when we consider that its counterpart in the old Penal Code, (Article 423) was
found under the General Provisions <sup><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></sup>(Chapter
VIII) of Title VIII covering crimes against persons. . There can, we think,
hardly be any dispute that as part of the general provisions, it could not have
possibly provided for a distinct and separate crime.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>We, therefore, conclude that Article 247 of the Revised Penal Code
does not define and provide for a specific crime, but grants a privilege or
benefit to the accused for the killing of another or the infliction of serious
physical injuries under the circumstances therein mentioned xxx<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Punishment, consequently, is not inflicted upon the accused. He
is banished, but that is intended for his protection.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It shall likewise be noted that inflicting death under
exceptional circumstances, not being a punishable act cannot be qualified by
either aggravating or mitigating or other qualifying circumstances. We cannot
accordingly appreciate treachery in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next question refers to the liability of the
accused-appellant for the physical injuries suffered by <span class="SpellE">Lina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amparado</span> and Arnold <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span>
who were caught in the crossfire as the accused-appellant shot the victim. The
Solicitor General recommends a finding of double frustrated murder against the
accused-appellant, and being the more severe offense, proposes the imposition
of reclusion temporal in its maximum period pursuant to Article 48 of the
Revised Penal Code. This is where we disagree. The accused-appellant did not
have the intent to kill the <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span> couple. Although
as a rule, one committing an offense is liable for all the consequences of his
act, that rule presupposes that the act done amounts to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>felony.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But the case at bar requires distinctions. Here, the
accused-appellant was not committing murder when he discharged his rifle upon
the deceased. Inflicting death under exceptional circumstances is not murder.
We cannot therefore hold the appellant liable for frustrated murder for the
injuries suffered by the <span class="SpellE">Amparados</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This does not mean, however, that the accused-appellant is
totally free from any responsibility. Granting the fact that he was not
performing an illegal, act when he fired shots at the victim, he cannot be said
to be entirely without fault. While it appears that before firing at the
deceased, he uttered warning words ("an <span class="SpellE">waray</span> <span class="SpellE">labot</span> <span class="SpellE">kagawas</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>),
that is not enough a precaution to absolve him for the injuries sustained by
the <span class="SpellE">Amparados</span>. We nonetheless find negligence on his
part. Accordingly, we hold him liable under the first part, second paragraph,
of Article 365, that is, less serious physical injuries through simple imprudence
or negligence. (The records show that Arnold <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span>
was incapacitated for one and one-half months;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
there is .no showing, with respect to <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span>, as to the extent of her injuries. We presume that
she was placed in confinement for only ten to fourteen days based on the
medical certificate estimating her recovery period.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>)</p>

<p class="BODY">For the separate injuries suffered by the <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span>
spouses, we therefore impose upon the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">arresto</span>
mayor (in its medium and maximum periods) in its maximum period, <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> being the graver penalty (than <span class="SpellE"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">destierro</i></span>).<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the
decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED. The accused-appellant is sentenced
to four months and 21 days to six months of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span>
