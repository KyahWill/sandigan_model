				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Two </span>(2) documents,
an “Agreement to Sell <span style="">Real </span>Property”
and a “Contract to Sell,” covering the same parcel of land were executed by a
seller in favor of two (2) different buyers.  Both buyers now assert against each other a better title to the
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dispute is an 18,260-square meter lot in the Poblacion of
Tigbauan, Iloilo, described in Plan Psu-223696, L.R.C. Case No. N-675, L.R.C.
Record No. N-38846, and registered under Original Certificate of Title No.
0-7743 in the name of seller Severino Tolosa.  On 20 August 1974, Tolosa mortgaged the land to the Philippine Veterans
Bank and had the encumbrance annotated on his certificate of title under Entry
No. 238353.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 March 1975, Tolosa and Pilar T. Ocampo, the latter being
then represented by Teresa T. Borres,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
entered into a contract whereby Tolosa undertook to sell the same parcel of
land to Ocampo not later than 15 May 1975 for P22,000.00, Pl,000.00 of which <span style="">was </span>paid upon execution thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 April 1975, the parties entered into an “Agreement to Sell
Real Property”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
whereby Tolosa “sells, cedes and transfers” the land to Ocampo in consideration
of P25,000.00, P12,500.00 of which was paid upon signing of the deed and the
balance to be due within six (6) months thereafter.  Paragraph 4 of the contract provides that “immediately upon
complete payment of the purchase price <span style="">x
x x </span>by the VENDEE, the VENDOR <span style="">x
x x </span>agrees to execute and deliver unto the VENDEE whatever pertinent
document or documents necessary to implement this sale and to transfer title to
the VENDEE.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the six-month period to complete the payment of the
purchase price expired, Ocampo paid but only the total of Pl6,700.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless Tolosa accepted her subsequent late payments amounting to
P3,900.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Meanwhile, the subject property was involved in a boundary dispute.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 June 1976, upon learning of the mortgage lien, Ocampo caused
her adverse claim to be annotated on Tolosa’s certificate of title as Entry No.
279936.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his letter to Ocampo dated 15 March 1977, Tolosa sought the
cancellation of Ocampo’s adverse claim and presented her with two options,
namely, a refund of payments made, or a share from the net proceeds if sold to
a third party.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
On even date, Ocampo through counsel wrote Tolosa expressing her readiness to
pay the balance of the purchase price, which was P5,400.00, should Tolosa be
ready to deliver to her the deed of absolute sale and the owner’s duplicate of
OCT No. 0-7743 for purposes of registration.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 3 June 1977, Tolosa and Magdalena S. Villaruz executed a
“Contract to Sell”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
whereby Tolosa “sells, cedes, transfers, and conveys” to Villaruz the same land
in consideration of P94,300.00.  The
amount of P15,000.00 was to be paid upon execution and the balance upon
cancellation of all liens and encumbrances from the certificate of title.  The contract stipulated the immediate
conveyance of the physical possession of the land to Villaruz, although no deed
of definite sale would be delivered to her unless the price was fully
paid.  The contract noted the supposed
judicial termination of the boundary dispute over the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 July 1977, Tolosa wrote Ocampo offering to reimburse her
what she paid provided she would sign a document canceling her adverse claim.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Failing to convince Ocampo, Tolosa filed a petition in the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo to cancel the adverse claim of Ocampo.  On 30 July 1977, Judge Ricardo M. Ilarde
denied the petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> On 4
August 1977, another adverse claim was caused to be annotated by Ocampo on OCT
No. 0-7743 under Entry No. 302257.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 October 1977, Tolosa filed an action for “Breach of
Contract, Damages and Quieting of Title” against Teresa Borres.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Borres claimed in her answer that she was merely the agent of Ocampo who was
the real party in interest.  Borres
however died so that the trial court, on 2 July 1979, ordered her substitution
by defendant Ocampo.  Magdalena S.
Villaruz, then claiming to have already bought the land, intervened in the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 October 1979, during the pendency of Civil Case No. 12163,
Tolosa succeeded in securing from another branch of the court the cancellation
of the adverse claims of Ocampo without notice to her.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This paved the <span style="">way </span>for the
registration on 23 November 1979 of the contract of sale of Villaruz dated 8
August <span style="">1979 and the subsequent issuance
of Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-100021 in her name which canceled the
Original Certificate of Title No. 0-7743 of Tolosa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 October 1981, Ocampo filed a third-party <span style="">complaint against Villaruz.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 January 1988, Judge Julian Y, Ereño of the Regional Trial
Court of Iloilo, Branch 27, rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 12163
dismissing the complaint of Tolosa as well as the complaint in intervention of
Villaruz -</p>

<blockquote>1.  Declaring the contract to sell executed
between plaintiff Severino Tolosa and third-party defendant Magdalena Villaruz
as null and void as well as the Transfer of Certificate of Title issued in
connection therewith, if any;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Ordering plaintiff Tolosa to execute the
corresponding deed of sale in favor of third-party plaintiff Pilar T. Ocampo
over the lot in litigation upon the latter’s payment of the balance of
P4,400.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Ordering plaintiff Tolosa to vacate and
deliver possession of the lot in question to Pilar T. Ocampo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Ordering plaintiff to pay Pilar T. Ocampo
P10,000.00 as attorney’s fees, P30,000.00 as moral damages, P2,000.00 as
litigation expenses, and costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Her motion for reconsideration having been denied on 26 March
1988, Villaruz appealed to the Court of Appeals.  On 11 October 1990, the 16th Division of the Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a> in CA-G.R. No. 18428, reversed and set aside the
trial court’s decision -</p>

<blockquote>1.  Declaring Magdalena S. Villaruz the absolute
owner of the parcel of land covered by TCT No. T­-100021 of the Register of
Deeds of Iloilo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Ordering the Register of Deeds of Iloilo to
annotate at the back of TCT No. T-100021 the adverse claims filed by Pilar
Ocampo under Entry No. 279936 and 302257 found in OCT No. 0-7743; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Ordering the parties to pay proportionate
costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court upheld the sale in favor of Villaruz on the theory
that the 21 April 1975 agreement of Tolosa and Ocampo was merely a contract to
sell.  It claimed that in the absence of
a deed of absolute sale in favor of Ocampo, in relation to par. 4 of the
contract, Tolosa retained ownership over the land and validly conveyed the same
to Villaruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">The agreement between Tolosa and Ocampo dated 21 April 1975
although titled “Agreement to Sell Real Property” was a perfected contract of <u>absolute</u>
sale wherein Tolosa forthwith sold, ceded and transferred the land to Ocampo.  It provided “[T]hat for and in consideration
<span style="">of </span>the sum of TWENTY-FIVE
THOUSAND PESOS (P25,000.00), Philippine Currency, to be paid by the VENDEE unto
<u>the VENDOR</u>, the latter hereby <u>SELLS, CEDES  and TRANSFERS</u> in favor of the former - her heirs and assigns,
the above-described parcel of land, free from all liens and encumbrances.”</p>

<p class="BODY">In <b>Dignos v. CA</b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a> we laid
down the criteria that:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x x a deed of sale is absolute in nature although denominated
as a ‘Deed of Conditional Sale’ where nowhere in the contract in question is a
proviso or stipulation to the effect that title to the property sold is
reserved in the vendor until full payment of the purchase price, nor is there a
stipulation giving the vendor the right to unilaterally rescind the contract the
moment the vendee fails to pay within a fixed period (<i>Taguba v. Vda. </i><i><span style="">de </span>Leon</i>, 132 SCRA 722; <i>Luzon
Brokerage Co., Inc. </i><i><span style="">v. Maritime
Building Co., Inc., </span></i>86 SCRA 305).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The conditions mentioned in <b>Dignos</b>, reiterating <b>Taguba</b>
and <b>Luzon Brokerage Co., Inc.</b>, were not found in the subject contract to
indicate that it was indeed <span style="">a </span>mere
contract to sell or a deed of conditional sale.  Contrary to the interpretation of the appellate court, we find
nothing significant about par. 4 of the contract which provides that -</p>

<blockquote>x x x immediately upon complete payment of the purchase price
herein by the VENDEE, the VENDOR hereby agrees to execute and deliver unto the
VENDEE whatever pertinent document or documents necessary to implement this
sale and to transfer title to the VENDEE.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 4 pertains to the undertaking of the seller to execute
and deliver to the buyer any document deemed necessary by law to implement the
sale and transfer title since the parties were unsure of what documents were
pertinent.  If the intent was for the
seller to retain ownership and possession of the land through non-delivery of
certain documents unless the price be fully paid, par. 4 alone should be
inutile; it should have been complemented with a <i>proviso</i> that the sale
would not be implemented nor the title considered transferred unless another
document specifically for said purpose be first executed and delivered to the
buyer.  In this regard, no right to
retain ownership <span style="">and possession of the
land pending full payment of the price can be inferred from the fact that no
delivery was made to Ocampo.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of the buyer to pay the price in full within a fixed
period does not, by itself, bar the transfer of the ownership or possession,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a> much less dissolve the contract of sale.  We held in <b>De la </b><b><span style="">Cruz </span>v. Legaspi:</b><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></b></span></a></p>

<blockquote>x x x x they err in the assertion that as plaintiff failed to pay
the price after the execution of the document of sale as agreed previously, the
contract became null and void for <i>lack of consideration</i>.  It cannot be denied that when the document
was signed the cause or consideration existed:  P450.  The document specifically
said so; and such was undoubtedly the agreement.  Subsequent non-­payment of the price at the time agreed upon did
not convert the contract into one <i>without</i> cause or consideration:  a <i>nudum pactum</i> (Levy <i>vs. </i>Johnson,
4 Phil. 650; Puato <i>vs. </i>Mendoza, 64 Phil. 457).  The situation was rather one in which there <i>is failure to pay</i>
the consideration, with its resultant consequences.  In other words, when after the notarization of the contract,
plaintiff failed to hand the money to defendants, as he previously promised,
there was default on his part at most, and defendants’ right was to demand
interest - legal interest - for the delay, pursuant to article 1501 (3) of the
Civil Code<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a> (Villaruel <i>vs</i>. Tan King,
43 Phil. 251), or to demand rescission in court.  (Escueta <i>vs</i>. Pardo, 42 Off. Gaz. 2759; Cortes <i>vs</i>.
Bibaño, 41 Phil. 298.) Such failure, however, did not <i>ipso facto </i>resolve
the contract, no stipulation to that effect having been alleged <i>(Cf</i>.
Warner Barnes &amp; Co. <i>vs</i>. Inza, 43 Phil. 505).  Neither was there any agreement nor
allegation that payment on time was essential <i>(Cf</i><span style="">. </span>Abella <i>vs</i>. Francisco, 55 Phil. 477; Berg <i>vs</i>.
Magdalena Estate, 92 Phil. 110).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under Art. 1592 of the Civil Code, the failure of Ocampo to
complete her payment of the purchase price within the stipulated period merely
accorded Tolosa the option to rescind the contract of sale upon judicial or
notarial demand.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the letter of 2 August 1977 claimed to have been sent by
Tolosa to Ocampo rescinding the contract of sale<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a> was
defective because it was not notarized<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a> and,
more importantly, it was not proven to have been received by Ocampo.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, Civil Case No. 12163 could not be considered a judicial
demand under Art. 1592 of the Civil Code because it did not pray for the
rescission of the contract.  Although
the complaint sought the cancellation of Ocampo’s adverse claim on Tolosa’s OCT
and for the refund of the payments made, these could not be equivalent to a
rescission.  In other words, seeking
discharge from contractual obligations and an offer for restitution is not the
same as abrogation of the contract.  To
rescind is “[t]o declare a contract void in its inception and to put an end to
it as though it never were.”<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a> It is
“[n]ot merely to terminate it and release parties from further obligations to
each other but to abrogate it from the beginning and restore parties to
relative positions which they would have occupied had no contract ever been
made.”<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming <i><span style="">arguendo</span></i><span style=""> </span>that Civil Case No. 12163 was a valid
judicial demand, rescission is not granted as a matter of course.  Before Civil Case No. 12163 was filed on 7
October 1977, Ocampo not only paid Tolosa a total of P20,600.00 but also
discharged Tolosa’s mortgage debt in the amount of P4,453.41.  Had not Tolosa ordered the Philippine
Veterans Bank to return the mortgage debt payment by Ocampo,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a> the purchase price would have been deemed fully
paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">If only to accentuate her intention to make good her contractual
obligations, Ocampo offered to pay the balance of the purchase price in her
letter of 15 March 1977 or more than four months before Tolosa allegedly wrote
his letter of rescission on 2 August 1977, and more than <span style="">six-</span>months before the filing of Civil
Case No. 12163 on 7 October 1977.  This
offer to pay prior to the demand for rescission is sufficient to defeat
Tolosa’s prerogative under Art. 1592 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tolosa, on the other hand, is now precluded from raising the
issue of late payments.  His unqualified
acceptance of payments after the six-month period expired constitutes waiver of
the period and, hence, of the ground to rescind under Art. 1592.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, however, the breach on the part of Ocampo was only
slight if not outweighed by the bad faith of Tolosa in reneging in his own
prestations, hence, judicial rescission of the contract cannot be
justified.  <b><span style="">Angeles v. Calasanz</span></b><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><b><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></b></span></a><span style=""> </span>is <i><span style="">apropos </span></i><span style="">-<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<blockquote>The right to rescind the contract for non-­performance of one of
its stipulations x x x is not absolute.  In <b>Universal Food Corp. v. Court of Appeals</b> (33 SCRA 1) the Court
stated:  The general rule is that
rescission of a contract will not be permitted for a slight or casual breach,
but only for such substantial and fundamental breach as would defeat the very
object of the parties in making the agreement (<b>Song Fo &amp; Co. v.
Hawaiian-Philippine Co.</b>, 47 Phil., 821, 827); The question of whether a
breach of a contract is substantial depends upon the attendant circumstances (<b>Corpus
v. Hon. Alikpala, et al.</b>, L-23707 &amp; L-23720, Jan. 17, 1968) x x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defendants-appellants state that the plaintiffs-appellees
violated Section two of the contract to sell x x x x because they failed to pay
the August installment, despite demand, for more than four (4) months.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The breach of the contract adverted to by the defendants-appellants
is so slight and casual when we consider that apart from the initial
downpayment of P392.00 the plaintiffs-appellees had already paid the monthly
installments for a period of almost nine (9) years.  In other words, in only a short time, the entire obligation would
have been paid.  Furthermore, although
the principal obligation was only P3920.00 excluding the 7 percent interest,
the plaintiffs-appellees had already paid an aggregate amount of
P4,533.38.  To sanction the rescission
made by the defendants-appellants will work injustice to the
plaintiffs-appellees (See <b>J.M. Tuazon and Co., Inc. v. Javier</b>, 31 SCRA
829).  It would unjustly enrich the
defendants-appellants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Article 1234 of the Civil Code which provides that ‘[I]f the
obligation has been substantially performed in good faith, the obligor may
recover as though there had been a strict and complete fulfillment, less
damages suffered by the obligee,’ also militates against the unilateral act of
the defendants-appellants in canceling the contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x x We agree with the plaintiffs-appellees that when the
defendants-appellants, instead of availing of their right to rescind, have
accepted and received delayed payments of installments, though the
plaintiffs-appellees have been in arrears beyond the grace period mentioned in
paragraph 6 of the contract, the defendants-appellants have waived and are now
estopped from exercising their alleged right of rescission.  In <b>De Guzman v. Guieb</b> (48 SCRA 68),
we held x x x x But defendants do not deny that in spite of the long
arrearages, neither they nor their predecessor x x x x even took steps to
cancel the option or to eject the appellees from the home-lot in question.  On the contrary, it is admitted that the
delayed payments were received without protest or qualification.  x x x x Under these circumstances, We cannot
but agree with the lower court that at the time appellees exercised their
option, appellants had already forfeited their right to invoke the above-quoted
provision regarding the nullifying effect of the non-payment of six-months
rentals by appellees by their having accepted without qualification on July 21,
1964 the full payment by appellees of all their arrearages.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the contract dated 3 June 1977 in favor of Villaruz is also
a contract of sale, that of Ocampo dated 21 April 1975 should prevail pursuant
to Art. 1544 of the Civil Code on double sales.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a> While
Villaruz may have registered his contract or came into possession ahead of
Ocampo, Villaruz was never in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since Ocampo had her adverse claim annotated on Tolosa’s OCT on 6
June 1976, Villaruz could not profess innocence thereof when she signed her
contract on 3 June 1977; in fact, her full payment of the purchase price was
made dependent, among others, on the cancelation of this claim.  Moreover, Villaruz <span style="">admitted having been informed by Tolosa of the first sale to Ocampo
while still negotiating to buy the land.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a><span style=""> Knowledge of the foregoing should have
impelled Villaruz to investigate the circumstances of the annotation since this
is equivalent to registration of Ocampo’s contract of sale as against Vil</span>l<span style="">aruz.  In sum, Ocampo having the older title in good faith and considering that
personal knowledge thereof by Villaruz constitutes registration as against the
latter, Ocampo should be considered the preferred buyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, the stipulation in the contract of Villaruz
conveying <span style="">the </span>land in her favor
bows to Tolosa’s admission at the witness stand on 15 May 1980 that he never
actually delivered the possession of the property to anyone.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, although the decision of the trial court
ordering Tolosa to execute another deed of sale in favor of Ocampo already
became final as against him for failing to appeal therefrom, there is no more

It was established at the trial that the P1,000.00 earnest money was paid on 11
