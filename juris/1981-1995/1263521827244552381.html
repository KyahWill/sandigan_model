Mandatory review of a death sentence.
<p>
In Criminal Case No. 202 of the defunct Court of First Instance of 
Capiz, an information for murder was filed against EUFROCINO ATANACIO as
 follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 5th day of November, 1970, in the 
municipality of Jamindan, province of Capiz, Philippines, and within the
 jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed 
with a locally made shotgun called 'pogakhang', with evident 
pre­meditation and treachery, and taking advantage of nighttime to 
facilitate the commission of the offense, did then and there, wilfully 
and unlawfully, with intent to kill, shoot and hit one Federico Escala 
with said shotgun, killing him instantly. </p>
  <p> "Contrary to law, with the qualifying circumstance of treachery 
and generic aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation and 
nighttime." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 23.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The accused was tried on his plea of "not guilty" and there­after he was sentenced as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this court finds the accused
 Eufrocino Atanacio guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
murder; and judgment is hereby rendered imposing upon him the capital 
penalty of DEATH; to indemnify the heirs of Federico Escala the sum of 
P12,000.00, and to pay the costs.  The bailbond posted by the accused 
for his provisional liberty is hereby can­celled." (<em>Id.,</em> pp. 207-208.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The People's version of the facts is:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On the moonlit night of November 5, 1970, at about 8:00 o'clock, 
Remedios Pablo went to fetch her husband Leodegario Pablo from the house
 of her neighbor, barrio captain Federico Escala, nicknamed Feding, in 
the barrio of Agambulong, Jamindan, Capiz.  Upon reaching the front yard
 of the house, she saw a man squatting under the kitchen thereof with a 
shotgun pointed upward.  Having recognized him (by the reflection of the
 bright light of the moon augmented by the light of the kerosene lamp in
 the said kitchen, the front part of which had no flooring)as "Appa", 
the nickname of Eufrocino Atanacio, she wanted to greet him but then his
 shotgun exploded, causing her to hide posthaste behind a post near the 
ladder of the house, even as "Appa" ran away toward the opposite 
direction where she was hiding.  She forthwith went up to the house, as 
she heard screams from upstairs that 'Feding is dead'.  Indeed, she saw 
Federico Escala lying on the floor between the kitchen and the "sala" 
surrounded by his mother, wife and children.  Right then and there, 
Remedios Pablo whispered to Federico's wife, Liberta Escala, that she 
saw "Appa" with a shotgun under their (the Escala's) house and that he 
fired it upward (TSN, pp. 22-30, Vol. I). </p>
  <p> "Apolinario Escala, who was then repairing to the small store of 
Federico Escala inside the latter's house to buy a canned good for 
viand, likewise heard the gun fire just as he was nearing said house.  
The blast punctuated his walk for he was taken aback by it.  Shortly, he
 saw a man come out from under the kitchen of the house, and, having 
recognized him as "Appa", nickname of Eufrocino Atanacio, he 
instinctively asked him what happened.  In reply, "Appa" pointed his 
shotgun at him (Apolinario) and warned the latter, 'Do not tell 
anybody,' after which, "Appa" de­camped (TSN, pp. 2-4, 13, Vol. I). </p>
  <p> "Later, Apolinario proceeded up to the house as he heard outcries 
of Federico's wife that 'Federico was shot.' There he found Federico in 
serious con­dition, being attended to by his mother and his wife.  
Moments thereafter, Federico expired.  Whereupon, Apolinario asked 
Federico's wife as to who shot him, and, when she could not tell, he 
apprised her of what he had seen, that is, that he saw "Appa" come out 
from under the kitchen of her house with a long gun, which he "Appa" 
pointed at him, Apo­linario, warning the latter not to reveal what he 
saw to anyone.  (TSN, pp. 14-15, Vol. I.) </p>
  <p> "The evidence further reveals that about two (2) weeks prior to 
the shooting at bar, Federico Escala, as overseer of Isidro Orocio 
harvested the palay on the parcel of land owned by the latter; that said
 land was claimed by Manuel Intas, who had Eufrocino Atanacio farm the 
same; that Eufrocino Atanacio went to the aforestated land and asked 
Federico Escala for his share of the harvest but Federico would not want
 to grant the request and told Eufrocino to see Oracio and ask him for 
his share; and that angered by said refusal of Federico to give him his 
share thereof, Eufrocino told Federico 'You will know someday, because 
something will happen to you' after which Eufrocino left in disgust 
(TSN, pp. 6-8, Vol. I)." (Brief, pp. 2-5.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The appellant claimed that he did not kill Federico Escala; that he was 
somewhere else when Federico was killed; and that it was another person -
 Carmelino Gevero - who killed Federico.  His assignment of errors 
raises the sole issue of the credibility of witnesses as shown by the 
following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I.    THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING FULL FAITH AND CREDIT TO THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION. </p>
  <p> "II.   THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE FATAL FLAWS IN THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION. </p>
  <p> “III.  THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CON­SIDERING THE EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENSE AS INCREDIBLE. </p>
  <p> “IV. THAT THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RULING THAT MORE CREDENCE BE 
GIVEN TO VERSION OF THE PROSECUTION BECAUSE ACCUSED HAD THE MOTIVE TO 
COMMIT THE CRIME. (Brief, p. A.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The judge who presided during the trial also penned the decision.  It is
 well-settled in this jurisdiction that the conclusions and findings of 
fact by the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal and 
should not be disturbed unless for strong and cogent reasons because the
 trial court was in a better position to examine the real evidence as 
well as to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.  Accordingly, Our 
principal task in this appeal is to scrutinize the record in order to 
ascertain if there is some fact or circumstance of weight and influence 
which was overlooked or the significance of which was misinterpreted.
</p><p>
The appellant states that "The government rested its case without any 
autopsy report or medico-legal findings on the injuries of the decased x
 x x and the death weapon was not submitted in evidence." (Brief, p. 5.)
</p><p>
As to the autopsy report, its lack was explained by the Fiscal as 
follows:  "The medical certificate was not presented because the doctor,
 who was then the Rural Health Physician of Jamindan, his whereabouts 
could not be found, I think he has separated from the service already." 
(TSN, Pabelico, p. 58.) And the failure to submit the gun in evidence 
was not a fatal omission because the People's evidence had established 
that the deceased died as a result of a gunshot and, in fact, the 
appellant's claim that Carmelino Gevero was the assailant tacitly admits
 the use of a gun.
</p><p>
Two witnesses pointed to the appellant as the perpetrator of the 
killing.  They were Remedios Pablo and Apolinario Escala whose testimony
 is summarized in the People's version of the facts, <em>supra</em>.
</p><p>
The appellant questions the credibility of Remedios and Apolinario thus:
  "x x x nowhere in their testimonies is their mutual presence [near the
 house of the deceased] confirmed by each other.  It is inherently 
impossible that one could not have seen the other."
</p><p>
We cannot perceive the significance of the supposed failure of the 
witnesses to see each other near the house of the deceased; We do not 
see how such circumstance could affect their credibility.  The substance
 of their testimony was not that they saw each other but that they saw 
the appellant - in the case of Remedios that he was under the house of 
the deceased and in the case of Apolinario that he met the appellant 
near the house of the deceased.
</p><p>
The appellant also claims that the evidence given by Apolinario and 
Remedios is "underscored with a series of contradictions, 
inconsistencies and deliberate falsehoods." True it is that the 
narration of events given by one was not completely congruent with the 
narration given by the other.  But the variances can be attributed to 
the fact that different persons have varying impressions and perceptions
 of a startling event.  In fact, the testimony of the two witnesses 
would be under a serious cloud if their evidence was completely 
congruent for such a circumstance would not be natural.  And it should 
also be noted that the discrepancies in this case related to minor 
matters only.
</p><p>
The defense of the appellant is not only alibi; he goes farther by attributing the crime to another person.
</p><p>
On the alibi, We quote with approval the trial court's decision as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "3. The defense of alibi of the accused cannot prevail over the 
positive identification of the wit­nesses of the prosecution that he was
 the person responsible for the commission of this crime.  These 
witnesses had not been shown to have been actuated by any improper 
motive in falsely laying this crime at his door.  The absence of 
evidence as to an im­proper motive actuating the principal witnesses for
 the prosecution strongly tends to sustain the conclusion that no such 
improper motive existed, and that their testimonies are worthy of full 
faith and credit.  (People vs. Sawah, No. L-15333, June 29, 1962, 5 SCRA
 385).  Besides, it was not entirely impossible for the accused to be at
 the scene of the crime at the time of its commission considering that 
Alimodian, Iloilo where he was working as a tenant of Baltazar Ambaan to
 Agambulong, Jamindan, Capiz, was easily accessible by bus.  The accused
 could have been in Agambulong, Jamindan on the day of the commission of
 the crime visiting with his family and commit it in the evening 
thereof.  To establish alibi, the ac­cused must show that he was at some
 other place for such a period of time that it was impossible for him to
 have been at the place where the crime was committed at the time of its
 commission.  (People vs. Alcantara, No. L-26867, June 30, 1970, 33 SCRA
 812." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 203-204.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Further on the defense of alibi, the appellant makes much of the entry 
in the police blotter (Exhibit 3, 3-A) which states:  "Federico Vacano, 
Nemsio Orocio, Elpidio Escala and Ening Escala reported to this office 
at 11:00 P.M. that the barrio captain Federico Escala was shot at his 
house at 8:00 P.M. by the suspect persons Adorico Domingo, Samuel Intas 
and Daniel Villarante.  He died spontaneously." But the persons who made
 the report could not have identified the culprits because they were not
 eye-witnesses to the crime.
</p><p>
Two witnesses testified that it was Carmelino Gevero who shot Federico Escala; they were Benjamin Laurilla and Jose Advincula.
</p><p>
Benjamin Laurilla said that he was the <em>compadre </em>of Federico 
Escala; that in the evening of November 5, 1970, he was on the way to 
Escala's house to buy kerosene when he heard a shot and then met 
Carmelino Gevero who was running and Gevero told him to run away also as
 he said, "I shot the barrio captain"; that he ran away and went home.  
On cross-examination, this witness said that Gevero "died about the last
 week of November 1970."
</p><p>
Jose Advincula testified that on November 6, 1970, the day after Escala 
was killed, "Carmelino Gevero came to our house and told me which I 
quote, 'Maninoy, I was the one who shot Federico Escala;’" that he 
instructed Carmelino to surrender to the PC but the latter said, "Just 
keep silent because I am going to escape."
</p><p>
The trial court correctly brushed away the stories of Laurilla and Advincula when it said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1. The court cannot believe the assertion of Benjamin Laurilla 
that Carmelino Gevero, without having been asked, would tell him that he
 had just shot Federico Escala.  And even if asked, it was doubtful that
 Carmelio Gevero would have confessed to Benjamin Laurilla that he had 
killed a man.  Criminals do not easily confess their deeds, unless faced
 with insurmountable forces.  On the contrary, they would keep them away
 from detection and dis­covery in consonance with that primordial 
instinct of self-preservation. </p>
  <p> The obedience of Benjamin Laurilla to the command of Carmelio 
Gevero to run away because he had just shot Federico Escala shows the 
puerility of his evidence.  Why should he run away when he had nothing 
to do with the killing?  It would have been more in keeping with natural
 human behavior had he proceeded to inform the family of Federico Escala
 as to the identity of his assailant, or, even just for the sake of 
curiosity, to find out what was happening in the house of Federico 
Escala and offer help if needed.  Thus, the testimonies of the two 
witnesses for the defense that after seeing the in­cident in question 
where a man was killed, they returned to their beds and after commenting
 lightly on the incident they saw, they slept, was properly discredited 
by the court because such behavior is not humanly natural, if what they 
related was true.  (People vs. Navarro, et al., No. L-20860, November 
28, 1964, 12 SCRA 530). </p>
  <p> "2. The court cannot give credit to the testimony of Jose 
Advincula considering that it proceeded from the mouth of a person who 
could have been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact.  Had he, on 
the very same day that Carmelino Gevero admitted to him the commission 
of this felony, reported the matter to the police authorities, justice 
would have triumphed.  His failure to immediately report the culpability
 of his godson, Carmelino Gevero, to the authorities perhaps was due to 
his desire to allow the latter's effective escape.  In effect, he had 
trifled with the cause of justice, and for him to seek it now is to mock
 it.  His testimony should be rejected." (<em>Expediente</em>, pp. 202-203.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The information alleges the qualifying circumstances of evident premeditation and treachery.
</p><p>
There is no proof of evident premeditation.  There is no proof of the 
following:  (1) the conception of the crime; (2) sufficient reflection 
on the consequences thereof; and (3) persistence resulting in the 
execution of the criminal act.
</p><p>
There was treachery because the appellant shot the deceased from under 
the latter's house without risk to himself and at the same time ensuring
 the success of the dastardly deed.  Alevosia absorbs nocturnity.
</p><p>
The deceased was killed in his house without provocation, hence the aggravating circumstance of <em>morada </em>should be considered.
</p><p>
The trial court correctly sentenced the appellant to suffer the death 
penalty but it cannot be affirmed for lack of the necessary votes in 
this Court.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of the trial court is modified:  the appellant is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos; and to pay the costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
