defunct Reparations Commission (REPACOM for brevity).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On July 30, 1982, PHILROCK

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The Board of Liquidators,
in its Answer with Counterclaim, alleged that REPACOM effected complete
delivery of the machinery and equipment to PHILROCK but no demand was made
regarding any hidden defect; that the machinery and equipment were inspected by
reputable companies pursuant to the Reparations Law, and the performance of the
plant was reported to be satisfactory at the time of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">delivery </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

equipment but a repossession was deferred, and the contractor/supplier was
required to make the necessary repairs; that the defect was attributed to <span class="SpellE">PHILROCK's</span> improper use of the</span> machinery; and that
PHILROCK is now in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> and guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> for not calling <span class="SpellE">REPACOM's</span>
attention to the alleged defects within the equipment's warranty period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its counterclaim, the Board demanded
payment by PHILROCK of the first ten (10) amortizations in the sum of P284<span class="GramE">,242</span>, expenses of litigation, moral and exemplary damages
and costs (pp. 62-63, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">PHILROCK relies on

the Board of Liquidators to undertake the liquidation of the remaining assets
and outstanding liabilities of REPACOM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Executive Order 635-A, amplifying the said authority of the Board,
expressly decreed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">"3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subject to the provisions of existing laws
and with the approval of the President of the Philippines, the Board of

priorities established by law, all outstanding obligations of the REPACOM
including the operational expenses of the REPACOM Residual Force." <span class="GramE">(Annex E, p. 32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">PHILROCK contends that
the proceeds from the disposal of the assets of REPACOM are "funds
appropriated by law" for the specific purpose of paying the liabilities of
REPACOM preparatory to its permanent closure (pp. 15-16, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The argument is not well
taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Liquidators is a

administering the assets and paying the liabilities of the defunct
REPACOM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not created for profit
or to engage in business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when a
suit is directed against said unincorporated government agency which, because
it is unincorporated, possesses no juridical personality of its own, the suit
is against the agency's principal, i.e., the State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On the other hand, if the
Government conducts a business through either a government-owned and controlled
corporation or a non-corporate agency set up primarily for a business purpose,
the entity enjoys no immunity from suit even if there is no express grant of </span>authority
to "sue or be sued." Having a juridical personality separate and
distinct from the government, the funds of such government-owned and controlled
corporation and non-corporate agency, although considered public in character,
are not exempt from garnishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
doctrine was applied to suits filed against the Philippine Virginia Tobacco
Administration (PNB vs. <span class="SpellE">Pabalan</span>, et al., 83 SCRA
595); the National Shipyard &amp; Steel Corporation (NASSCO vs. CIR, 118 Phil.

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The sale of the rock
pulverizing plant to PHILROCK by the Board of Liquidators, although proprietary
in nature was merely incidental to the performance of the Board's primary and
governmental function of settling and closing the affairs of the REPACOM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, its funds in the Philippine National
Bank are public funds which are exempt from garnishment (p. 75, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court

that when the State consents to be sued, it does not necessarily concede its
liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By consenting to be sued, it
waives its immunity from suit, but it does not waive its lawful defenses to the
action (<span class="SpellE">Meritt</span> vs. Government, 31 SCRA 311,
318).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even when the government has been
adjudged liable in a suit to which it has consented, it does not necessarily
follow that the judgment can be enforced by execution against its funds for, as
