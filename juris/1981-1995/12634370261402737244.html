				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner seeks reversal of his conviction for violation of Section
3 (e) of Rep. Act No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act.  He claims that as his
guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, he should be accorded the
constitutional presumption of innocence.  The petitioner presumes too much.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the incident in question, Domingo de Guzman was
the Officer-in-Charge and Assistant Director of the Bureau of Plant Industry.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
As such, he received the sum of P200,000.00 on December 17, 1985, with
authority to disburse it in connection with certain official training programs
of the Department of Agriculture.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> In a
disbursement voucher dated February 5, 1986,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> he
claimed credit for the amount but when required later to produce the supporting
receipts failed or refused to do so.  This led to the filing against him of the corresponding information,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
to which he pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the People presented one witness<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and several exhibits purporting to show that as a public officer the accused
had received the said amount but failed to show that it had been lawfully
disbursed for the training programs allegedly held at Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur,
and Baguio City.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
After the prosecution had rested, the defense sought but did not obtain leave
to file a demurrer to evidence but filed it just the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> Under
Rule 119, Section 15, of the Rules of Court, this would result in the
forfeiture of the right of the defense to submit its own evidence if the
demurrer was denied.  Ultimately, on
November 19, 1991, the Sandiganbayan rendered judgment disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Domingo de
Guzman y Mateo GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the Violation of Section 3,
paragraph (e) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act, and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the
indeterminate penalty of imprisonment ranging from SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1)
MONTH as the minimum, to NINE (9) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY as the maximum; to
further suffer perpetual disqualification from public office; to indemnify the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines in the amount of P200,000.00, and
to pay the costs of this action.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the present petition, the respondent court is faulted for
basing its conviction on inconclusive evidence and giving credence to the lone
government witness as against the documentary evidence of the lawful
disbursement of the amount in question.  It is argued that in criminal prosecutions every doubt must be resolved
in favor of the accused, but this rule was disregarded by the Sandiganbayan.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no such doubts in the case before us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner himself has admitted having received the sum of
P200,000.00 in his capacity as OIC and Assistant Director of the Bureau of
Plant Industry.  He claims this was
spent for training programs in Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur and Baguio City, but
there is no positive evidence whatsoever that such training programs were
really conducted.  He has not presented
a single receipt to support his alleged disbursements and show that no undue
injury has been caused to the Government.  Clearly, all this has resulted in violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic
Act No. 3019, reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Section 3.  Corrupt
practices of public officers. - In addition to acts or omissions of public
officers already penalized by existing law, the following shall constitute
corrupt practices of any public officer and are hereby declared to be unlawful:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e) Causing any
undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private
party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his
official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality,
evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.  x x x.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In her testimony for the prosecution, Josephine Angeles declared
that as training officer and chief of the training unit of the Bureau of Plants
and Industry from 1985 to 1986, she knew of no training programs conducted by
the BPI at Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur, and Baguio City during that period.  Such training programs would have been
officially brought to her attention if they had actually been held.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner argues, however, that on cross-examination she
admitted that there might have been training programs held at that time that
might not have been officially communicated to her.  It is now suggested that the training programs at Ipil, Zamboanga
del Sur, and Baguio City might well have been among such programs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, this <i><span style="">negative</span></i><span style=""> </span>statement cannot prevail against her
categorical and positive assertion that as chief of the training program she
was supposed to know, and did know, about all such training programs funded by
the BPI.  In the second place, she said
that the training programs that could have been held without her knowledge were
those funded not by the BPI but by foreign agencies.  In the third place, the mere conjecture that the training
programs could have been held is no proof that they were actually held.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also places much value on Exhibit E,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the petitioner's disbursement voucher carrying the certification of the Chief
Accountant that <i><span style="">inter alia</span></i><span style=""> </span>it "is supported by documents
appearing legal and proper." That is a bare statement, however, and there
is no explanation of what these documents are, nor are the supporting receipts
attached or annexed to the said voucher.  As the Sandiganbayan correctly concluded:</p>

<blockquote>x x x When accused claimed credit for the cash advance of
P200,000.00 in the Disbursement Voucher, dated February 5, 1986 (Exhibit E),
for the expenses incurred during Three Regional Trainings in Ipil, Zamboanga
del Sur and Baguio City <i>without any supporting receipts in liquidation
thereof, as can be seen from said exhibit itself, and without submitting
testimonial or documentary evidence to justify either the cash advance or the
alleged expenses, then it stands clearly and positively established that he had
misappropriated said amount for his personal use or benefit</i>.  The attempt to liquidate the cash advance in
question appears to be amateurish and ill-conceived and which sustains anew the
prosecution's charge that accused had acted with manifest partiality and
evident bad faith in the discharge of his official functions, thus causing
undue injury to the government.  (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence against the petitioner is in our view sufficient to
convict.  The government had established
that he had received the money and had failed to account for it, thus
overcoming the presumption of innocence in his favor.  Instead of refuting that <span style="">evidence,
</span>he smugly belittled it as if it were too inconsequential to
disprove.  Significantly, he sought
leave to file a demurrer to evidence, which he filed just the same even if
leave was denied by the respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner insists that it is not for him to show that the
supporting receipts exist; on the contrary, it is for the prosecution to prove
that they do not exist.  This is,
indeed, a strange manner of accounting.  As for the possibility that the training programs "might have
really occurred," to use Angeles' words, this is a mere speculation that
cannot explain the petitioner's failure to account for the P200,000.00
entrusted to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The situation before us is starkly simple.  The petitioner received P200,000.00 from the
government to defray the expenses of training programs.  He has not liquidated it short of saying it
was spent for some amorphous training programs not on record.  Who should prove those training
programs?  The petitioner, of
course.  And he should do so with concrete
facts and figures supported by receipts, not with the mere undocumented surmise
that the training programs could have been held.</p>

<p class="BODY">We should not stretch the presumption of innocence beyond its
reasonable intendment.  Let us not
forget that it is only a presumption and can yield to contrary evidence of
guilt.  That evidence has been amply
established in this case.  The
petitioner's conviction was not based on what the Sandiganbayan mistakenly
called a presumption of his guilt.  The
finding of guilt was not a presumption but a <i><span style="">conclusion</span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

petitioner.  It is so ordered.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">VITUG, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">With all due respect, I find it most difficult to share the
opinion expressed by the majority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner has been charged with having violated Section 3(e) of
Republic Act No. 3019, as amended.  The elements
of the offense are:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That the offender is a public officer;</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he has acted with
manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence in the
discharge of his official, administrative or judicial functions; and</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he has thereby
caused undue injury to any party, including the government, or has given any
private party an unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference.</p>

<p class="BODY">Except for the first element, which is conceded, the evidence on
record, in my view, is clearly inadequate to justify the conviction of the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, the amount of P200,000.00 was received by, and in
the custody of, petitioner with authority to disburse <span style="">the sum for training programs in </span>the implementation <span style="">of the agricultural recovery program </span>aforementioned.  <span style="">In
convicting petitioner, the </span>Sandiganbayan <span style="">depended, by and large, on </span>(1) <span style="">the </span>testimony of lone <span style="">witness
Josephine Angeles that <u>as</u></span> <u><span style="">far</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">a</span></u><u><span style="">s</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">she</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">knew</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">no</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">training</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">programs</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">were</span></u><span style=""> <u>funded</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">or</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">held</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">by</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">BPI</span></u><span style=""> </span>in 1985 <span style="">and 1986; and (2) the failure of the </span>petitioner
<u><span style="">to</span></u> <u><span style="">support</span></u> <u><span style="">his</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Disbursement</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Voucher</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">(Exhibit "E"), for expenditures
incurred during "Three Regional </span>Trainings in <span style="">Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur and Baguio
City," </span>with supporting receipts in liquidation thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">While Josephine Angeles did declare that to <span style="">her </span>knowledge <span style="">there have been no training programs held or </span>funded by BPI in
1985 <span style="">to </span>1986, <u><span style="">on</span></u><span style=""> <u>cross-examination,</u> <u>however</u></span><u><span style="">,</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">she</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">has</span></u><span style=""> <u>a</u></span><u><span style="">dmitted</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> <u>possibility</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">such</span></u><span style=""> <u>courses</u> <u>havin</u></span><u><span style="">g</span></u><span style=""> <u>been</u> <u>given</u>
<u>b</u></span><u><span style="">y</span></u><span style=""> <u>BPI</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>region,</u>
<u>since</u> <u>she</u> <u>would</u> <u>onl</u></span><u><span style="">y</span></u><span style=""> <u>be</u> <u>certain</u> <u>on</u> <u>training</u> <u>seminars</u> <u>coordinated</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">by</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">her</span></u><u><span style="">.</span></u><span style="">  </span><u><span style="">On</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">further</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">questioning</span></u><u><span style="">,</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">she</span></u><span style=""> <u>has</u> <u>even</u> <u>confirmed</u> <u>that</u>
<u>such</u> <u>trainin</u></span><u><span style="">g</span></u><u><span style="">s</span></u><span style=""> <u>could</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">have</span></u><span style=""> <u>“</u></span><u><span style="">really</span></u><span style=""> <u>occurred</u> <u>because</u> <u>there</u> <u>was</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>report</u> <u>submitted</u>
<u>concerning”</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">same</span></u><span style="">.  </span>I
also gather that the implementation of training programs which are foreign-funded
are not coordinated by the witness.  (The records before us are bereft on the source for the funding of the
P200,000.00 cash advance.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The only remaining piece of evidence or, more accurately perhaps,
the lack of it, is that petitioner has failed to account, with receipts, for
the P200,000.00 cash advance.  The
majority opinion, I most humbly submit, regrettably has failed to properly take
into account Exhibit E - "disbursement voucher, dated February 5, 1986 in
liquidation of the cash advance in the amount of P200,000.00 in favor of
accused Domingo de Guzman" - certified to by no less than Daniel B.
Coloma, Jr., to the effect that said liquidation is "supported by
documents, appearing legal and proper.”</p>

<p class="BODY">I am perturbed by the following statement found in the majority
opinion:</p>

<blockquote>"The situation before us is starkly simple.  The petitioner received P200,000.00 from the
government to defray the expenses of training programs.  He has not liquidated it short of saying it
was spent for some amorphous training programs not on record.  Who should prove those training programs?
The petitioner, of course.  And he
should do so with concrete facts and figures supported by receipts, not with the
mere undocumented surmise that the programs could have been held."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Lest we miss it, petitioner is not being
charged with improper accounting.  The
provision of law under which he stands accused of having violated reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 3. Corrupt Practices of public officers. - - In
addition to acts or omissions of public officers already penalized by existing
law, the following shall constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and
are hereby declared to be unlawful:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e) Causing
any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private
party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his
official, administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality,
evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.  x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I cannot go along with the Sandiganbayan when it has conjectured
that petitioner's failure to submit supporting receipts to his Disbursement
Voucher, raises the <u><span style="">presumption</span></u><span style=""> </span>that "he misappropriated said
funds and should be x x x sentenced accordingly." In essence, the
Sandiganbayan tells petitioner that because he demurred at the evidence of the
prosecution, the certification made by Daniel B. Coloma, Jr., on Exh. E, i.e.,
that the liquidation in the disbursement voucher is properly documented and
supported, must now be disbelieved; that petitioner must now thereby be
considered to have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross
negligence in the discharge of his official and administrative functions; and
that he has thereby caused undue injury to the government; and, <u><span style="">ergo</span></u><span style="">, </span>he "must be sentenced accordingly.”  So much, in my view, has been drawn from so
little that is given in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even remotely assuming that the several assumptions made by the
Sandiganbayan are appropriate and sanctionable, I doubt it whether they can
measure up to the level of <u>p</u><u><span style="">roof</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>beyond</u> <u><span style="">reasonable</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">doubt</span></u><span style=""> </span>required for conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are cases, it is true, where <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>facie</u>
evidence is authorized and sufficient to warrant a conviction.  These exceptional cases must, however, be
statutorily expressed (see, for instance Art. 217, Revised Penal Code; People
vs. Mingoa, 92 Phil 856; Vallarta vs. Court of Appeals, 150 SCRA 336; Bacasnot
vs. Sandiganbayan, 155 SCRA 379) one that is altogether wanting in Republic Act
No. 3019 of which violation the petitioner is accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution must stand on the merits of its own case and on
the strength of its evidence.  An
accused, by constitutional fiat, is not under obligation to prove his
innocence, for he needs only, if he desires, to disprove that evidence which,
without <span style="">rebuttal, </span>would be
enough to establish the requisite moral certainty that can justify
conviction.  These rules have been
observed with constancy and consistency, for they rest not by simple rhetorics
or personal inclinations but on valued traditions enshrined in law and
jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">ACCORDINGLY, I vote for the reversal of the judgment of <span style="">conviction </span>appealed from.</p>
