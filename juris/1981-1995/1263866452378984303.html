<span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Branch X
in Civil Case No. 1209-V-80, which dismissed the private respondents’ complaint
for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of real property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents are the vendees of a parcel of land measuring 105
square meters covered by Tax Declaration No. 2502 in the names of certain <span class="SpellE">Cirila</span> <span class="SpellE">Mistica</span> and her
children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original deed executed on
September 5, 1961 covered 57 square meters (Exhibit "R") but the
second deed executed on February 5, 1963 covered 105 square meters instead of
57 square meters ("may <span class="SpellE">sukat</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>
<span class="SpellE">Isang</span> <span class="SpellE">Daan</span> at <span class="SpellE">Limang</span> (105) <span class="SpellE">metrong</span> <span class="SpellE">parisukat</span> <span class="SpellE">humigit</span> <span class="SpellE">kumulang</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">halip</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">Limampu’t</span> <span class="SpellE">Pitong</span> (57) <span class="SpellE">metrong</span> <span class="SpellE">parisukat</span>" <span class="SpellE">kasunduan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilihang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuluyan</span>
(Annex "A" of amended complaint).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents claimed to be in possession since 1963 of said parcel of land,
where they constructed valuable improvements, including a 3-door apartment in
1963.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the year 1978, respondents
discovered that defendants-petitioners together with their deceased brother, <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Tomas, applied for the registration of a parcel of
land known as Lot No. 2826 of the <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>
Cadastre, and "either by mistake or by design" included therein a
portion of the land belonging to respondents consisting of 65 square meters adjacent
to the <span class="GramE">parcel</span> owned by petitioners on the Northern
part thereof, and obtained Original Certificate of Title No. 0-6337 of the
Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, which included the said
65 square meters of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
refused to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the said land to respondents,
thus an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> was instituted (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Memorandum for Respondents, pp. 148-148-A).</p>

<p class="BODY">The action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> was filed
by respondents against petitioners before then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> on January 2, 1979 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Memorandum for Respondents, p. 147).</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the
petitioners and against respondents, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, judgment is hereby
entered dismissing plaintiffs’ amended complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants’ counterclaim is likewise
dismissed." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "A", p. 20) <span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment of the lower court is reversed and another
one entered ordering respondents to cause the segregation of the disputed
portion of 65 sq. meters presently occupied by plaintiffs, forming part of
Original Certificate of Title No. 6337 (0-191) (M) issued in Land Registration
Case No. <span class="GramE">N-1147-V, now Transfer Certificate of Title No.
11718 (M) in the name of defendants, and to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the same to the plaintiffs.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
the segregation order has been accomplished the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> is hereby ordered to issue a new certificate of
title conveying said 65 sq. meters in favor of plaintiffs, and another
certificate of title in favor of the defendants covering the remaining portion.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED."</span> <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "A", pp. 35-36).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners raised the following assignments of errors to the
effect that respondent Court of Appeals:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) misapprehended the facts; and (2) erred in not dismissing the
complaint on the grounds of:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) absence
of allegation of fraud; (b) <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>; and (c) prescription or <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Second Division of This Court in its resolution dated June 5,
1989 gave due course to the petition (Petition, pp. 6-15; Resolution, p. 132).</p>

<p class="BODY">Memorandum for the respondents (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 146-157) was filed on August 24, 1989 while Memorandum for the petitioners
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 158-177) was filed on August 26, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issues in this case are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) whether or not the Court of Appeals has the right to change or
disturb the factual findings of the trial court; and (2) whether or not the
respondents’ complaint should be dismissed on the above-stated grounds.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">I</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3, Rule 51 of the Rules of Court defines the power of the
Court of Appeals on appeals taken to it, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court of Appeals, in the exercise of its appellate
jurisdiction, may affirm, reverse, or modify the judgment or order appealed
from, and may direct a new trial or further proceeding to be had.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When a new trial shall be granted, the court
shall pass upon all the questions of law involved for the final determination of
the action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The reason behind this rule is that the Court of Appeals may thus
re-examine and re-weigh all the evidence on record and affirm, modify or
reverse the findings of facts and conclusions of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is an established rule that appellate courts will not
generally disturb the factual findings of the trial court, considering that the
latter is in a better position to decide the question (having heard the
witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying
during the trial), this does not apply in the case at bar where the lower court
overlooked certain facts of substance and value which if considered would
affect the result of the case (People v. <span class="SpellE">Royeras</span>, 130
SCRA 265 [1984]; Aguirre v. <span class="GramE">People, 155 SCRA 338 [1987]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Among the basic errors noted are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> failed to consider that the respondents:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) have been in actual, open, peaceful and
continuous possession of the subject matter of this dispute since 1961
exercising acts of dominion over it; (b) have constructed a 3-door apartment
thereon which they rented in favor of third persons; and (c) have declared the
same and the existing improvements thereon for tax purposes, and which taxes
they have paid religiously.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In legal
contemplation the possessor has the presumption of title in his favor (Article
433, Civil Code of the Philippines).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, petitioners, for several years, not only failed to file any
protest or object to the respondents' operating a business in the latter's own
name and holding himself out to the public as the owner thereof but also
constructed a party wall themselves to indicate the boundary line between the
two lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, the foregoing
circumstances plus the fact of long and continuous possession are <span class="GramE">a strong</span> indications that the respondents are the true
owners of the disputed land.</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> erred in concluding that the land of <span class="SpellE">Cirila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mistica</span> and her children (former owners of the
disputed land) was included in the titled lands of a certain <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Deganos</span> (Lots 5026, 2845,
2846 of the <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span> Cadastre) when on the
contrary, said lots of <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Deganos</span>
are bounded by the land of <span class="SpellE">Cirila</span> <span class="SpellE">Mistica</span>,
the predecessors-in-interest of respondents (Exhibits "F-2",
"F-3" and "F-4"), as confirmed by the Certificate of Title
of <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> <span class="SpellE">Deganos</span> (Exhibit
"F-9").</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the trial court failed to consider that the land of
Dolores <span class="SpellE">Juson</span>, mother and predecessor-in-interest of
the petitioners, has an area of <u>600</u> <u>square</u> <u>meters</u> <u>only</u>
and is bounded on the north by the land of <span class="SpellE">Cirila</span> <span class="SpellE">Mistica</span> (Exhibits "A" and "A­-1",
"BB", "BB-1" "BB-3" and "BB-4").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same area appears in the sale to Mrs.
Dolores <span class="SpellE">Juson</span> on October 10, 1942 from Tomas <span class="SpellE">Juson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> <span class="SpellE">Juson</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are
also found in the extra-judicial settlement executed by the petitioners
themselves on June 9, 1962 after the death of Dolores <span class="SpellE">Juson</span>
where petitioners stated and admitted that their land had an area of 600 square
meters only and in the tax declaration of Dolores <span class="SpellE">Juson</span>
which likewise referred to an area of 600 square meters as declared by
petitioner Elena J. Tomas in her declaration (Exhibit "CC").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, OCT No. 0-6337, the disputed
title, covers a parcel of land with an area of <u>650</u> <u>square</u> <u>meters</u>,
an indication that an excess not belonging to petitioners was covered (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 19).</p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> q<u>uo</u> without basis, failed to consider
that the findings and conclusions of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Salenga</span>,
a Geodetic Engineer, that approximately 65 square meters of the property of <span class="SpellE">Cirila</span> <span class="SpellE">Mistica</span> was included in
Cadastral Lot No. 2826 in the name of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Juson</span>,
were based on actual ground verification survey, the technical descriptions on
file with the Bureau of Lands and the tax declarations and approved plan of
adjoining property owners and other documents (TSN, p. 17, August 13, 1981; pp.
5-8, 9-10, September 1, 1981; p. 24, September 22, 1981).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it will be noted that Engineer <span class="SpellE">Salenga</span> testified before another judge, then Judge Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>; thus, his demeanor, conduct and attitude during
the trial could not have been observed by Judge Nestor F. <span class="SpellE">Dantes</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">ponente</span> of the contested decision (Memorandum for
the Respondents, pp. 149-153).</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">II</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals correctly found:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the complaint alleges the commission
of fraud by stating that petitioners while professing all the time to recognize
the rights of respondents to the said land, registered the same in their names;
(b) that an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> is not barred by
the finality of the judgment in the Land Registration case, the former being an
action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>; and (c) that the
period of prescription or <span class="SpellE">laches</span> which is ten years
has not yet expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1456 of the Civil Code provides that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"If a property is acquired through
mistake or fraud, the person obtaining it is, by force of law, considered a
trustee of an implied trust for the benefit of the person from whom the
property comes."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, prescription will not lie in favor of the
petitioners who are not even in possession of the disputed land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, they obtained the property by
mistake or fraud so that by operation of law, they are considered as trustees
of an implied trust for the benefit of the respondents from whom the property
came.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
based on an implied trust or constructive trust prescribes in ten years from
the issuance of <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> title over the property (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Buncio</span> v. Estate of the
late Anita de Leon, 156 SCRA 352 [1987] which must be brought within ten years
from the time of accrual of the cause of action (<span class="SpellE">Alcos</span>,
et al. v. IAC, 162 SCRA 825 [1988]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents' action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> was filed
on January 2, 1979, one year from the time respondents discovered that
petitioners together with their deceased brother applied for the registration
of a parcel of land known as Lot No. 2826, in 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">An action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> is a legal
remedy granted to a rightful owner of land wrongfully or erroneously registered
in the name of another to compel the latter to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the land to him (<span class="SpellE">Esconde</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Barlongay</span>,
152 SCRA 603 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The prevailing rule in this jurisdiction does not bar a land
owner whose property was wrongfully or erroneously registered under the Torrens
System from bringing an action after one year from issuance of the decree, for
the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the property in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
does not seek to set aside the decree but, respecting the decree as
incontrovertible and no longer open to review, instead seeks to transfer or <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the land from the registered owner to the rightful
owner (<u>Ibid</u>).</p>
