VS. HON. MANUEL A. ARGEL, PRESIDING JUDGE OF

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and the Court of Appeals over
a criminal case decided by the city court of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1975</st1:date>
Rolando Ventura was charged by an assistant fiscal in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
court with <u>frustrated qualified theft</u> of a tin can of edible oil valued
at five pesos, belonging to his employer, <span class="SpellE">Plame</span>
Manufacturing Corporation (Criminal Case No. 102175).</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the city court convicted <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
of simple theft and imposed upon him a penalty of three months and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span><u> mayor</u> and ordered him to pay an
indemnity of five pesos.</p>

<p class="BODY">He appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was assigned to its <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Branch 35, pre­sided over by Judge Manuel A. <span class="SpellE">Argel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fiscal in a manifestation dated <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1977</st1:date> contended that the Court of First
Instance had no appellate jurisdiction over the case because it was allegedly
within the concurrent jurisdiction of the city court and the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prayed that the appeal
should be forwarded to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Argel</span> denied the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> prayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="3">March 23,
 1977</st1:date> he acquitted <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
on the ground of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1977</st1:date>,
the fiscal and the private prosecutor filed in this Court the instant petition
for <i>certiorari</i>, praying that the said judgment be declared void on the
ground of lack of appellate jurisdiction and that <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>'s
appeal be trans­mitted to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether the city court's judgment of con­viction
should be reviewed by the Court of First Instance or by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the Court of First Instance has no appellate
jurisdiction over the case and, therefore, its decision is void. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The proceeding in that court was <span class="SpellE"><u>coram</u></span> <u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>judice</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance has no appellate jurisdic­tion
because frustrated qualified theft of an object valued at five pesos is
penalized with <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u> maximum to
<span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
minimum or four months and one day to two years and four months (Arts. 309[6]
and 310, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">That crime falls within the <u>concurrent original jurisdiction</u>
of the city court and the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A municipal or city court has <u>original</u>
jurisdiction over theft (larceny) cases where the amount of money or property
stolen does not exceed the sum or value of two hundred pesos [Sec. 87(b)(3),
Judiciary Act of 1948, Republic Act No. 296 as amended by Republic Acts Nos.
2613 and 3828].</p>

<p class="BODY">But that <u>original</u> jurisdiction of the inferior court is
not <u>exclusive</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <u>concurrent</u>
with the Court of First Ins­tance in case the penalty for the theft or larceny
exceeds imprisonment for six months or is a fine of more than two hundred
pesos.</p>

<p class="BODY">That is the settled ruling which is based on the following
provisions of the Judiciary Act of 1948, Republic Act No. 296:</p>

imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding six thousand

Republic Act No. 2613 which took effect on August 1, 1959 and Republic Act No.
3828 which took effect on June 22, 1963).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the frustrated qualified theft falls within
the <u>concurrent original</u> jurisdiction of the inferior court and the Court
of First Instance because of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> pro­vision
of section 44(f) of the Judiciary Law that Courts of First Instance have
original jurisdiction "in all criminal cases in which the penalty provided
by law is imprisonment for more than six months, or a fine of more than two
hundred pesos".</p>

<p class="BODY">Stated in other words, the <u>original</u> jurisdiction of the
Court of First Instance over criminal cases in which the pe­nalty provided by
law is imprisonment for more than six months or a fine of more than two hundred
pesos is not <u>exclu­sive</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not <u>exclusive</u> because there are criminal cases
falling within the <u>original</u> jurisdiction of the municipal and city
courts, as provided in section 87, wherein the imposable penalty exceeds six
months' imprisonment or two hundred pesos' fine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It should be repeated that those criminal
cases</u> are <u>within the concurrent original jurisdiction of the inferior
court and the Court of First Instance</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, simple theft of an object valued at five pesos, which is
penalized by <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u> minimum and
medium or one month and one day to four months, falls within the <u>exclu­sive
original</u> jurisdiction of the municipal or city court.</p>

<p class="BODY">But frustrated qualified theft of the same object, which, as
already noted, is penalized by imprisonment for four months and one day to two
years and four months, falls within the <u>original</u> jurisdiction of the
Court of First Instance as well as within the <u>original</u> jurisdiction of
the municipal or city court because of sections 44(f) and 87(b<span class="GramE">)(</span>3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Consequently,</span> and as already noted, the jurisdiction of the
inferior court and the Court of First Ins­tance over the said frustrated theft
of an article valued at five pesos is <u>concurrent</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>concurrent original</u> jurisdiction of the inferior court
and the Court of First Instance over the said frustrated theft case is also
sanctioned by the penultimate paragraph of sec­tion 87 as amended [not by
paragraph (c) as held in Tan vs. People, L-47482, July 21, 1978, 84 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 207].</p>

<p class="BODY">That penultimate paragraph provides that "municipal judges
in the capitals of provinces and <span class="SpellE">subprovinces</span> and
judges of city courts shall have like jurisdiction as the Court of First
Instance to try parties charged with an offense committed within their
respective jurisdictions, in which the penalty provided by law does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
or imprisonment for not more than six years or fine not exceeding six thousand
pesos or both".</p>

<p class="BODY">So, paragraph (b) and the penultimate paragraph of section 87 <u>both</u>
justify the concurrent jurisdiction of the inferior court and the Court of
First Instance over the instant frustrated theft case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that sense, the two paragraphs over­lap.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>,
L-40037, April 30, 1976, 70 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 531, the <u>concurrent
original</u> jurisdiction of municipal courts of provincial capitals and city
courts and the Courts of First Instance over certain criminal cases, as pro­vided
in the penultimate paragraph of section 87, overlaps or coexists with their concurrent
original jurisdiction over certain offenses mentioned in paragraphs (b) and (c)
of section 87.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now if, as shown above, the instant frustrated theft case falls
within the <u>concurrent original</u> jurisdiction of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city> city court and the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
then it follows that the Court of First Instance <u>has no appellate
jurisdiction over that case</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the decision of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
city court was not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court of First
Instance but should have been appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basis of that holding is found in two separate and distinct
provisions of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> section 45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <u>third</u> <u>paragraph</u> of
section 45, as amended by Republic Act No. 6031, it is clearly provided that
"in cases falling under the <u>concurrent</u> <u>jurisdictions</u> of the
municipal and city courts with the Courts of First Instance, the appeal shall
be made directly to the Court of Appeals whose decision shall be final".</p>

<p class="BODY">Another provision of section 45, dealing with the same subject
matter, is the first paragraph thereof which provides that "Courts of
First Instance shall have appellate jurisdic­tion over all cases arising in
city and municipal courts, in their respective provinces, except over appeals
from cases tried by municipal judges of provincial capitals or city judges <u>pursuant
to the authority granted under the last paragraph of section 87</u>".</p>

<p class="BODY">And the last paragraph of section 87 provides that all criminal
cases in which the penalty does not exceed <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">correccional</span></u> or imprisonment for not more than
six years or a fine not exceeding six thousand pesos, or both, which are filed
with municipal judges of provincial capitals and city court judges, shall be
tried and decided on the merits by the said judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "proceedings had shall be recorded
and decisions therein shall <u>be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> direct(<span class="SpellE">ly</span>) to the Court of Appeals</u> or the Supreme Court, as
the case may be", depending on whether factual issues or pure legal issues
are involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the above-cited legal provisions, it is clear that
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Argel</span> of the Court of First Instance
at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> erred in exercising appellate
jurisdiction over the frustrated qualified theft case decided by the city
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Note that the appeal from the inferior court to the Court of
First Instance, as provided in the first paragraph of section 45 of the
Judiciary Law and in section 1, Rule 40 and section 5, Rule 123 of the Rules of
Court is the <u>general rule</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As shown in the preceding discussion, the <u>exception</u> to
that general rule in criminal cases is found in section <span class="GramE">45
itself</span> and in the last paragraph of section 87.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span>, L-32166, <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1977</st1:date>, 79 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 450, the municipal court of Sta. Cruz, Laguna,
dismissed a com­plaint for electro-fishing, an offense penalized by a fine up
to five hundred pesos which falls within the <u>concurrent jurisdiction</u> of
the inferior courts and the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the order of dismissal, the prosecution appealed to the
Court of First Instance which affirmed the order of dis­missal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution filed in this Court a
petition for the review of that order under Republic Act No. 5440.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was held that the Court of First Instance had no appellate
jurisdiction to review the municipal court's order of dismissal and that the
said order was directly <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> from the municipal
court to this Court pursuant to section 45 and the last paragraph of section 87
of the Judiciary Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Esperat</span> vs. Avila, L-25922, June 30,
1967, 20 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 596, it was held that the judgment of
the city court of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City con­victing the
petitioner of grave coercion was <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> directly
to the Court of Appeals and not to the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the city court found that the crime com­mitted by
Ventura is simple theft falling within the <u>exclusive original jurisdiction</u>
of the city court is of no moment because the court's jurisdiction in criminal
cases is determined by the allegations of the complaint or information and not
by the findings which the court may make after the trial (People vs. Mission,
87 Phil. 641; People vs. Co <span class="SpellE">Hiok</span>, 62 Phil. 501; U.S.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cueson</span>, 24
Phil. 366; U.S. vs. Jimenez, 41 Phil. 1).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter of an action may be
raised at any stage of the proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When jurisdiction over an offense has not been conferred by law, the
accused can­not confer it by express waiver or otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conviction or acquittal rendered by a court
having no jurisdiction is absolutely void (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span>, 24 Phil. 90).</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Argel</span>, in support of his
contention that he has appellate jurisdiction, cites the ruling that the Court
of First Instance has appellate jurisdiction over a criminal case which is
within the concurrent jurisdiction of the ordinary municipal court and the
Court of First Instance (People vs. Valencia, L-29396, August 29, 1969, 29 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 252).</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts and the law involved in the <st1:country-region><st1:place><u>Valencia</u></st1:place></st1:country-region>
case are different from those involved in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:country-region><st1:place><u>Valencia</u></st1:place></st1:country-region>
case refers to the judgment of a municipal court, not a city court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the <u>municipal court</u> of
San Luis, Aurora Sub-Province in 1964 convicted <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Daguman</span> of illegal possession of firearms, a crime
falling within the <u>concurrent jurisdiction</u> of the <u>municipal court</u>
and the Court of First Ins­tance by reason of section 45(f) and section
87(b)(9), as amended by Republic Act No. 2613.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Daguman</span> appealed to the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, he moved for the
dismissal of his appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended
that the case was <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court of Appeals,
as held in <span class="SpellE">Esperat</span> vs. Avila, L-25922, June 30, 1967,
20 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 596.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was held that appeal should be made to the Court of First
Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings in the <u>municipal
court were not recorded</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, a direct appeal to the Court of Appeals would not be
practicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was then no statutory
authority for a direct appeal to the Court of Appeals from a judgment rendered
by an ordinary municipal court in a criminal case falling within the concurrent
jurisdiction of the municipal court and the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time the <u>Valencia</u> case was decided, the only
statutory authority for a direct appeal to the Court of Appeals was from the
judgment of the municipal court of the provincial capital and the city court in
criminal cases, as contemplated in the first paragraph of section 45 and the
penultimate and last paragraphs of section 87 as amended by Republic Act No.
2613.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings in the inferior
court in such cases have to be recorded (<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pirante</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>, 121 Phil.
794).</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Argel</span> also invoked <span class="SpellE">Paringit</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Masakayan</span>, 112 Phil.
861.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That case does not involve any
direct appeal to the Court of Appeals from the judgment of a city court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has no relevancy to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused contends that in theft and <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases the concurrent jurisdiction of the city court
and the Court of First Instance arises only when the amount involved <u>exceeds
two hundred pesos</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
accused con­tends that, inasmuch as the amount involved in the instant
frustrated theft case is only five pesos, the case falls within the <u>exclusive
original</u> jurisdiction of the city court and the appeal from its judgment of
conviction should be made to the Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention is flagrantly wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is manifestly contrary to the ruling of
this Court in Tan vs. People, L-47482, August 1, 1978, 84 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
207 and People vs. <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>, L-40037, April 30, 1976,
70 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 531 and the cases cited therein, that where
the penalty for the offense over which the inferior court has jurisdiction
exceeds imprisonment for six months or a fine of two hundred pesos, the
inferior court's <u>original</u> jurisdiction is concurrent with the <u>original</u>
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance to try such offenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 44(f) of the Judiciary Law, in providing that the Court
of First Instance has original jurisdiction "in all criminal cases in
which the penalty provided by law is impri­sonment for <u>more than</u> six
months, or a fine of <u>more than</u> two hundred pesos" clearly implies
that criminal cases in which the penalty is imprisonment for <u>not more than</u>
six months or a fine of <u>not more than</u> two hundred pesos fall within the <u>exclusive
original jurisdiction</u> of the municipal and city courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, section 87 of the Judiciary Law, as originally enacted
in 1948, contained a paragraph (b) which provides that the justice of the peace
and municipal courts (later designated municipal and city courts, respectively)
had original jurisdic­tion over "all offenses in which the penalty
provided by law is imprisonment for not more than six months, or a fine of not
more than two hundred pesos, or both such fine and imprisonment".</p>

<p class="BODY">That jurisdiction was <u>exclusive</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It complemented para­graph (f) of section 45
which paragraph (f) has not been amended since it was enacted in 1948.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original paragraph (<u>b</u>) of section 87 was amended by
Republic Act No. 3828, which took effect on June 22, 1963, and was replaced by
what is now paragraph (<u>c</u>) which provides that, except for violations of
election laws, municipal and city courts have jurisdiction over offenses
wherein the penalty pro­vided by law is imprisonment for not more than three
years or a fine of not more than three thousand pesos, or both such fine and
imprisonment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>original</u> jurisdiction of inferior courts prescribed in
paragraph (c) is in addition to the jurisdiction of city and municipal courts
to try violations of ordinances [<span class="GramE">paragraph(</span>a)] and the
eleven classes of offenses mentioned in what is now paragraph (b) of section
87.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should always be borne in mind that the <u>original</u>
jurisdiction of municipal and city courts to try offenses enu­merated in
paragraphs (b) and (c) and the penultimate paragraph of section 87 becomes <u>concurrent</u>
with the <u>original</u> jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance to try the
same offenses <u>when the imposable penalty exceeds imprisonment for six months
or a fine of two hundred pesos</u>.</p>
