dated <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1981</st1:date> on
the petitioner's application for clearances to terminate the services of the

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are summarized by the respondent Deputy
Minister of Labor and Employment as follows:</p>

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> Complainant was employed by respondent on <st1:date year="1950" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1950</st1:date> as a field
warehouseman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since then, he has
received awards and commendations, including the coveted 'Salesman of the Year'
as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>promotions, both in
rank and salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1967, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>appointed District Sales
Supervisor with latest salary of P1<span class="GramE">,940.00</span> per month,
plus monthly living allowance of P20.00 <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>
allowance of P80.00 and housing all<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">o</span>wance
of P160.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1978</st1:date>, complainant was re<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">lieved </span>of
his duties as District Sales Supervisor, pending investigation of his alleged
involvement in the 'cash refunding of condemned shells'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="8">August
 29, 1978</st1:date>, respondent filed with the Ministry a report of
complainant's preventive suspension, illegal dismissal and illegal deduction of
salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's action was by way
of opposition against his <span class="GramE">termination,</span> consequently,
the two actions were consolidated.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Among complainant's duties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>District Sales Supervisor was to
condemn 'shells' which refer to empty wooden cases used in packing <span class="SpellE">softdrinks</span> bottles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime in November 1977 complainant was instructed by Mr. Orlando <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Neri</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, </span>then Plant Manager, <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span> Coca-Cola Plant to condemn all <span class="SpellE">unrepairable</span>
shells in the <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span>
Sales Office of the Company.</p>

<p class="2Q">"In connection therewith, respondent charged complainant with
the following infractions:</p>

<p class="2Q">"On <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="11">November 21,
 1977</st1:date>, he ordered the sales office in <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span></st1:place> to condemn 700 shells
contained in miscellaneous slip No. 0226-A, but only 300 shells were allegedly
destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1971</st1:date> he ordered also the sales
office in <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span></st1:place>
to condemn 680 shells under miscellaneous slip No. 0228-A but only 228 shells
were destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1977</st1:date>, he likewise ordered same
sales office to condemn 600 shells under miscellaneous slip <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">No. </span>0234-A but only 480 shells were
destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent further alleged
that starting November 23, 1977, Juan Burgos, the Salesman-in-Charge of the <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span> Sales Office cash-refunded little by little the
shells which were condemned but not actually destroyed and made it appear that
they came from shells refunded by respondent's customers; that the process was
repeated up to December 30, 1977 until Burgos was able to raise the amount of
P4,860.00 which he allegedly gave to complainant; and that all the above
happened at respondent's branch in <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
also alleged that on <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="11">November 23,
 1977</st1:date>, complainant ordered the sales office at <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span></st1:place> to condemn 1,000
shells under miscellaneous slip no. 0444 out of which only 140 shells were
destroyed; and that on <st1:date year="1977" day="5" month="12">December 5,
 1977</st1:date>, he likewise ordered said sales office to condemn 2,000 shells
under miscellaneous slip no. 6574 but only 1,728 were destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent charged that all these were made
possible at the <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span> Branch where complainant
approached <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Refria</span>,
Salesman-in?charge of the branch, who for fear of harassment, enlisted
the help of Armando de <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas, warehouseman; and
that <span class="SpellE">Refria</span> was able to refund, in cash, for the
period covering from November 2, 1977 the total amount of P1<span class="GramE">,360.00</span>
which he allegedly gave <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to complainant.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Relative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>the
foregoing, respondent alleged that complainant borrowed from Juan Burgos during
the month of November and December, 1977 the amount of P4,860.00; that out of
fear, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Burgos </span>gave the amount to
complainant Hap Lee, one of respondent's customers, at its <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>
Sales Office; that said money represented the proceeds of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">cash </span>refunds for shells <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">owned </span>by Hap Lee who requested the <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span> Sales Office to hold the money for safekeeping;
that complainant allegedly told Burgos to replace the amount out of the cash
refunds he could make from condemned shells.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, respondent charged complainant with taking m<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">oney </span>from <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Refria</span> at the <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span>
Branch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">amounting </span>to P1<span class="GramE">,360.00</span> where the same procedure for refunding out of the
condemned shells was followed to raise the amount stated."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner based its application for clearance to terminate
the private respondent on the grounds of falsification of company documents,
abuse of authority, and unauthorized removal of company records.</p>

employment therefore would only worsen his relationship with the company on one

portion of her order reads:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">We find no merit in the
due process argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
Solicitor General that, "to disregard an evidence is different from not
considering it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The former implies prior
consideration or deliberation, but the evidence is not given any weight for being
of no value; the latter connotes the absence of examination or appraisal which
is a due process violation."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Regional Director after considering the
petitioner's evidence found it insufficient to support the charges raised in
the application for clearance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Regional Director, however, gave clearance to terminate the private respondent
on the ground that the petitioner corporation could have lost its trust and
confidence in the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the consideration of the parties' evidence conducted by
the regional director and the deputy minister sufficient to meet the standards
of due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, we find that
the conclusions of the respondent deputy minister are not supported by the
facts which he examined.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Soto is not an ordinary worker limited to the handling
of routine tasks in the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is
the Coca-Cola District Supervisor covering sales offices in the two provinces
of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The salesman-in-charge of the <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>
Sales Office, Mr. Juan A. Burgos, and the warehouseman of the <span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span> Sales Office, Mr. Armando B. de <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas testified during the investigation that their
supervisor, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> L. Soto, would condemn a
certain number of shells but not all would be destroyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A portion of the condemned shells would be
made to appear as shells returned by customers to whom cash refunds were
given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this way, the respondent was
able to raise the money that he needed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It can be gathered from the records that the petitioner entrusts a
considerable amount of business in a wide area in two provinces to the private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner cannot
successfully conduct its business much less compete with other <span class="SpellE">softdrinks</span> firms if it does not have full trust and
confidence in its district sales supervisor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The respondent Regional
Director found that Mr. Soto's evidence consisted of "self-serving
denials" but she wanted more concrete evidence of condemned shells being
actually cash refunded together with receipts of the payments. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>She, </span>moreover, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">concluded that puzzling questions remain unanswered because of
insufficient evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
Deputy Minister agreed with the Director's factual evaluations but made his own
observations not based on the records on why he found it hard to believe that
customers would allow branch employees to hold their cash refunds or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">money for safekeeping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He would also want the private respondent to
be present when the anomalous refunding of shells was being effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We stated in <u>Reyes v. Zamora</u> (90 SCRA
92):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Loss of confidence is a valid ground for dismissing an
employee, and proof beyond reasonable doubt of the employee's misconduct -

191) It is sufficient if there is 'some basis' for such loss of confidence; (<span class="SpellE">Galsim</span> v. PNB, 29 SCRA 293) or if the employer has
reasonable grounds to believe, if not to entertain the moral conviction that
the employee concerned is responsible for the misconduct and that the nature of
his participation therein rendered him absolutely unworthy of the trust and
confidence demanded by his position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Nevans</span> v. CIR, 23 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

funds, goods, and properties must be beyond suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trust and confidence in the private
