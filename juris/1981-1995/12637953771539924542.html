				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal on <i>certiorari</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
involves Article 1606 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first paragraph of this article declares that in cases of <i>conventional
redemption</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> i.e.,
when the vendor reserves the right to repurchase the thing sold -- with the
obligation to return the price of the sale as well as the expenses of the
contract, any other legitimate payments made by reason of the sale, the
necessary and useful expenses made on the thing sold,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and other stipulations which may have been agreed upon -- the right to
repurchase, in the absence of an express agreement, shall last four years from
the date of the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second
paragraph says that should there be an agreement, the period cannot exceed ten
years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the third and last paragraph
-- and it is this which is directly relevant to the case at bar -- reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"However, the vendor may still exercise the right to
repurchase within thirty days from the time final judgment was rendered in a
civil action on the basis that the contract was a true sale with right to
repurchase."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under a "Deed of Sale With Right to Repurchase,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the spouses <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Orias</span>
and Milagros O. Lim (private respondents herein) sold to Pedro A. <span class="SpellE">Felicen</span>, Sr. (petitioner) a parcel of land in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Salcedo</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:placename></st1:place> with an area of 7.8
hectares at the price of P3,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
deed expressly reserved to the vendors the right to redeem within two (2)
years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That period expired without any
offer having been made by the vendors <i>a retro</i> to repurchase the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some eight (8) years afterwards,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> the vendors <i>a retro</i> filed
suit in the Court of First Instance against the vendees to compel the latter to
resell and <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the property to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After due proceedings, the Trial Court
rendered judgment, finding that the contract between the parties was in truth
one of sale with <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i> de retro</i>, and
that the period stipulated for the repurchase had already expired; but this
notwithstanding, the vendors <i>a retro</i> still had the right to repurchase
the property within thirty (30) days from the time the judgment becomes final,
in accordance with the third <span class="SpellE">paragaph</span> of Article 1606
of the Civil Code, by complying with the requirements of Article 1616.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Trial Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> It
pronounced as correct the Lower Court's conclusion that the claim of the
vendors <i>a retro</i> -- that they had twice offered to repurchase the land
but that these had been refused -- had not been proven, the <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
proofs being totally devoid of details that could engender persuasiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also pronounced correct the finding that
the contract in question could not be deemed to be one of loan, its terms being
so plainly and distinctly indicative of a sale with <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i>
de retro</i> as to preclude its construction as some other kind of agreement,
besides bearing none of the well known indicia of a disguised mortgage,
enumerated in Article 1602 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, the Appellate Court deemed proper the application of the
third <span class="SpellE">paragaph</span> of Article 1606 since the main issue
in the case was the <span class="SpellE">obtention</span> of a judicial
declaration that the agreement was a simple mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thesis of both the Trial Court and the Appellate Court, in
other words, was that although the vendors <i>a retro</i> had failed in their
suit to prove that their contract with the vendees was actually one of loan
with mortgage, the contract having on the contrary been confirmed to be a sale
with conventional redemption, they could nonetheless still repurchase the
property "within thirty days from the time final judgment was rendered in
a civil action on the basis that the contract was a true sale with right to
repurchase", pursuant to said third paragraph of Article 1606.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The thesis cannot upon the undisputed facts
be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The application of the third paragraph of Article 1606 is
predicated upon the <i>bona fides</i> of the vendor <i>a retro</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must appear that there was a belief on his
part, founded on facts attendant upon the execution of the sale with <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i> de retro</i>, honestly and sincerely
entertained, that the agreement was in reality a mortgage, one not intended to
affect the title to the property ostensibly sold, but merely to give it as
security for a loan or other obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In that event, if the matter of the real nature of the contract is
submitted for judicial resolution, the application of the rule is meet and
proper:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the vendor <i>a retro</i>
be allowed to repurchase the property sold within 30 days from rendition of
final judgment declaring the contract to be a true sale with right to
repurchase.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
Conversely, if it should appear that the parties' agreement was really one of
sale -- transferring ownership to the vendee, but accompanied by a reservation
to the vendor of the right to repurchase the property -- and there are no
circumstances that may reasonably be accepted as generating some honest doubt
as to the parties' intention, the proviso is inapplicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is quite obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the rule were otherwise, it would be
within the power of every vendor <i>a retro</i> to set at naught a <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i> de retro</i>, or resurrect an expired right
of repurchase, by simply instituting an action to reform the contract -- known
to him to be in truth a sale with <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i> de
retro</i> -- into an equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As postulated by the petitioner,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> "to allow herein private
respondents to repurchase the property by applying said paragraph * * to the
case at bar despite the fact that the stipulated redemption period had already
long expired when they instituted the present action, would in effect alter or
modify the stipulation in the contract as to the definite and specific
limitation of the period for repurchase (2 years from date of sale or only
until June 25, 1958) thereby not simply increasing but in reality resuscitating
the expired right to repurchase * * and likewise the already terminated and
extinguished obligation to resell by herein petitioner." The rule would
thus be a made a tool to spawn, protect and even reward fraud and bad faith, a
situation surely never contemplated or intended by the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has already had occasion to rule on the proper
interpretation of the provision in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In <i>Adorable v. Inacala</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> where the proofs established that
there could be no honest doubt as to the parties' intention, that the
transaction was clearly and definitely a sale with <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i>
de retro</i>, the Court adjudged the vendor <i>a retro</i> not to be entitled
to the benefit of the third paragraph of Article 1606.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar is on all fours with <i>Adorable</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here, as in the earlier case, the evidence
persuasively establishes not only the utter paucity of the vendors' assertion
that they had tried to exercise the right to repurchase within the stipulated
period, but also that the contract was clearly and distinctly a contract of
sale with <span class="SpellE"><i>pacto</i></span><i> de retro</i> and contained
no provision from which another kind of contract could fairly and reasonably be
deduced, and furthermore exhibited none of the familiar badges of a covert
mortgage specified by the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court perceives no reason to deviate from the doctrine in <i>Adorable</i>,
and a disposition in accord therewith is thus inevitable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgments of the Court of Appeals and the
Trial Court are reversed, and another entered declaring the private
respondents' right to repurchase to have expired upon expiration of the period
stipulated <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and that ownership of the
property in question has long since been acquired by and now rests in the
petitioner, his heirs, successors and assigns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Costs against private respondents.</p>
