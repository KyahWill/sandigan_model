assails the resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC),
dismissing her claim for separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner started teaching in the respondent school in August
1972.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She went on maternity leave
effective August 26 up to <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="10">October 10,
 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of
complications resulting from the delivery of her child, she asked for a leave
extension and filed an application for indefinite leave of absence until such
time as she would be ready to report for work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1982</st1:date>,
she reported for work but was able to teach for only one day because she
suffered a nervous breakdown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the
Christmas vacation, she again filed an application for an indefinite leave of
absence because of poor health but this was disapproved by the school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="9">September
 13, 1983</st1:date>, upon the advice of the school principal, she submitted
the following letter:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was then and there paid her two months vacation pay by
the school.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the school opened in June 1985, the petitioner, who had in
the meantime fully regained her health, applied for reinstatement, but the
school refused to re-hire her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Feeling
aggrieved, she filed a complaint for reinstatement, <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and other benefits with the NLRC in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The labor
arbiter treated her complaint as a claim for separation pay and dismissed it
for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved by the decision of the Labor Arbiter, petitioner
appealed to the NLRC on the sole ground that the labor arbiter erred in holding
that her resignation was voluntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1987</st1:date>,
the NLRC dismissed the appeal holding that since the petitioner had voluntarily
resigned from her teaching position and thereby severed the employer-employee
relationship, she is not entitled to any separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner came to this Court for relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">After deliberating on the petition and the public and private
respondents' comments, we find the petition meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent NLRC committed a grave abuse
of discretion when it disregarded facts in the records proving that the
petitioner's supposed "resignation" was involuntary, that it was in
fact procured by her employer on the promise that she would be given priority
for re-employment and in consideration of immediately paying her two months
vacation which she desperately needed then because she was ill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated in her letter:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"I wish to get my two months vacation
salary dated April-May 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In connection
with this am (sic) tendering my resignation <u>as advised and wished by the
administration</u> on conditions that I'll be given priority to be accepted
when the time comes when I will be ready to render service to the school."
In the same letter, she expressed the hope that the school administration
"will be true and sincere to their promise," and that it would
release her vacation pay "as soon as possible because I need it very
badly." <span class="GramE">(p. 20, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span>
These circumstances prove beyond cavil that the petitioner was <u style="text-underline:words">forced</u> to resign.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her resignation was involuntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The school had no right to disapprove petitioner's application
for an indefinite leave of absence due to illness caused by the delivery of her
child and to force her to resign instead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Article 133(b) of the Labor Code provides:</p>

<blockquote><i>"ART. <span class="GramE">133(b).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The maternity leave shall be extended without
pay on account of illness medically certified to arise out of the pregnancy,
delivery, abortion, or miscarriage, which renders the woman unfit for work,
unless she has earned unused leave credits from which such extended leave may
be charged." <o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The school must have realized that it could not dismiss the
petitioner for health reasons under Art. 284 of the Labor Code because
apparently her illness was not "prejudicial x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> as well x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
to the health of her co-employees" nor the kind that would have legally
prohibited her continued employment, and, even if her service was terminable on
account of illness, the school would have been required to pay her
"separation pay equivalent to at least one (1) month salary or to one-half
(1/2) month salary for every year of service, whichever is greater, a fraction
of at least six (6) months being considered as one (1) whole year."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, it inveigled her to "resign" so it could avoid
paying her separation pay for her 10-year service to the school.</p>

<p class="BODY">To extricate itself from its promise to re-hire her, the school
made her husband sign in her behalf an unconditional letter of resignation when
he went to the school to collect his wife's vacation pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That letter is not binding on the petitioner
for there is no proof that she authorized her husband to write it for her and
to waive her right to be re-hired as promised by the school or to abandon her
right to separation pay if she would not be reinstated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The school's refusal in bad faith to re-employ her despite its
promise to do <span class="GramE">so,</span> amounted to illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, she is entitled to be
reinstated with three years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> (People's
Industrial &amp; Commercial Employees &amp; Workers Org. vs. People's
Industrial &amp; Commercial Corp., 112 SCRA 449; <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span>
