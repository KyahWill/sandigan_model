<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO and in violation to Art. 248 paragraph 1 of the
Revised Penal Code." (pp. 26-27, Original Records)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The dispositive portion of the decision finding the above accused
guilty beyond reasonable doubt reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Court finds all the accused
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, and therefore
sentences:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) Alfonso Auditor to suffer
an indeterminate imprisonment of twelve (12) years of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u>
as minimum to twenty years (20) of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> as maximum;
and Estrello Auditor, Adriano Aparece and Remegio Alvarez to suffer <u>reclusion</u>

shall be credited the full preventive imprisonment they have undergone.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As regards Roy Auditor, he being a minor of 15 years at the
time of the commission of the crime, the Court refrains from imposing a penalty
on him, but instead suspends all proceedings and commits him to the custody and
care of the Ministry of Social Services and Development until he shall have
reached twenty-one years of age or, for a shorter period as the Court may deem
proper considering the reports and recommendations of said Ministry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused minor shall be subject to visitation
and supervision by a representative of Ministry of Social Services and
Development which shall submit its report every four (4) months on the conduct

emotional progress made by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">him."
(p. 25, Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence upon which the trial court based its finding of
guilt is summarized in the decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Dr. Uldarico Supremo, Municipal Health officer of Claveria
testified that he examined the dead body of Juancho Takiang in Ane-i,
Claveria.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He identified the Medical
Certificate which he issued (Exh. A).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
said that wound Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were caused by a sharp edged instrument,
such as a bolo, whereas wound No. 5 was caused by a blunt instrument.</blockquote>

<blockquote>" "He declared that the neck of Juancho Takiang was
almost severed due to wound No. 1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rogelio Undag testified substantially that at 8:00 o'clock in
the morning of April 24, 1978, he was in the house of his father-in-law Juancho
Takiang at Tagonino, Ane-i, Claveria because on the previous day the latter
told him they were going to plant corn on that Monday, April 24, Lucio Dumo,
another son-in-law was with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
farm of Juancho Takiang was about 100 meters from his house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The three went to the farm, Juancho Takiang walking ahead of
them by 15 meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He (Rogelio) saw
Estrello Auditor standing on the farm of Juancho.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Estrello approached Juancho and boxed
him, hitting him on his right eye.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Juancho was slightly staggered backward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rogelio and Lucio attempted to go near Juancho, but then they saw two
persons, Alfonso Auditor and Roy Auditor coming out of the bamboo grooves -
Alfonso was holding a scythe and a bolo tucked on his waist, while Roy was
bringing a piece of wood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same
time, two other persons, whom he identified as Adriano Aparece and Remegio
Alvarez, each also bringing a piece of wood as big as the arm of a 10-year old
person, and 18 inches long, appeared.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Alfonso Auditor hacked Juancho wounding him on his left arm,
while Roy, Remegio and Adriano rushed at and bumped Juancho causing him to fall
to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After falling Juancho
rolled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Estrello who was at the back of
Juancho then got the scythe from his father Alfonso and slashed his neck,
almost severing it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Alfonso
unsheathed his bolo and hacked Juancho twice wounding the latter on his
back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Alfonso went near Roy,
Adriano, Remegio and Estrello and signalled Rogelio and Lucio to go near them,
saying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'Come here and we will also kill
you like your father-in-law.' Rogelio and Lucio were standing 15 meters away at
that time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Later, Alfonso, Estrello, and Roy went home, while Adriano
and Remegio remained near the place where Juancho was lying wounded - they were
two meters from Juancho.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, the
two went to the house of Alfonso.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the two were gone, Rogelio and Lucio went near Juancho
and when they saw that he was not moving anymore and believe that he was
already dead, Rogelio asked Lucio to call for a doctor and a policeman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, later, Dr. Uldarico Supremo, patrolman
Cosadio and other persons came and Dr. Supremo examined the body.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rogelio declared further, that Hilario Takiang, son of
Juancho, was staying at Natobo, 20 kilometers away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The wife of Juancho, Rogelio's mother-in-law
was at Natobo that is why he and his wife went to sleep in Juancho's house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rogelio said that he and Lucio brought with them weeding
bolos, while Juancho brought with him an ordinary bolo, one foot long.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to Rogelio, the first time he saw Estrello, the latter
was five meters from Juancho.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Estrello
had a menacing attitude towards Juancho, Juancho just faced him and when
Estrello was near Juancho, without any exchange of words, boxed the latter
immediately.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He and Lucio did not go near because they were afraid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimony of Rogelio Undag was corroborated by that of
Lucio Dumo in almost all points.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Because of the report of Lucio to the police at Claveria,
Police Cpl. Eugenio Cosadio fetched Dr. Uldarico Supremo, the Municipal Health
Officer of Claveria, and the two, together with the police photographer Cpl.
Pagidopon, patrolman Wilfredo Casino, Sulpicio Abesamis, Jr., Foilan Orlando
Anillaga and Rosauro Amor, went to the scene <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the scene,
they saw the body of Juancho Takiang lying on the ground face downward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Supremo and the police examined the body.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to Cpl. Cosadio, when they approached the body, he
saw a scythe on the ground one meter from the dead body of Juancho.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>He</u> <u>said</u> <u>that</u> <u>when</u>
<u>he</u> <u>got</u> <u>the</u> <u>scythe</u> <u>Rogelio</u> <u>Undag</u> <u>told</u>
<u>him</u> <u>that</u> <u>was</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>scythe</u> <u>used</u>
<u>by</u> <u>Estrello</u> <u>Auditor</u> <u>in</u> <u>killing</u> <u>Juancho</u>
<u>Takiang.</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>He</u> <u>said</u> <u>that</u>
<u>the</u> <u>scythe</u> <u>was</u> <u>smeared</u> <u>with</u> <u>blood.</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>blood</u> <u>was</u> <u>not</u>
<u>yet</u> <u>dry.</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>He</u> <u>said</u>
<u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>scythe</u> <u>marked</u> <u>as</u> <u>Exh.</u> <u>C</u>
<u>was</u> <u>the</u> <u>scythe</u> <u>he</u> <u>saw</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He also saw the bolo of Juancho Takiang tucked on his waist
unsheathed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He unsheathed it and he saw
it was not bloodstained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said Exh. E
was the bolo." (pp. 13-15, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Alfonso Auditor admitted
having killed Juancho Takiang but claimed that he acted in self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He assumed sole responsibility for the
killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other co-accused deny any
participation in the violent incident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In their self-defense
theory, the appellants admit that Alfonso Auditor and Juancho Takiang were
mortal enemies and attribute the alleged unlawful aggression of Takiang to a

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The facts of the case
from the viewpoint of the accused-appellants are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="6">6:30 A.M.</st1:time>
on <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1978</st1:date>
accused-appellant Alfonso Auditor was clearing his farm located at Tagonino,
Ane-i, Claveria, Misamis Oriental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
eighty meters behind him were accused-appellants Estrello Auditor, Roy Auditor,
Adriano Aparece and Remegio Alvarez who were sowing corn together with Sabina
Auditor - Alfonso's wife, their daughter Nida, Rodrigo Platan, Rogelio Platan,
Juana Acob and Marcial Ibanez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except
for the Auditors, all the rest were hired laborers, including
accused-appellants Alvarez and Aparece.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning, Juancho Takiang arrived and confronted accused-appellant
Alfonso Auditor for working on the farm and asked him to stop.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Juancho alleged that he was the one who
plowed the farm for corn planting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alfonso countered that the farm belongs to him, and in fact, Juancho and
his son Hilario Takiang agreed to leave the farm to him in the compromise
agreement (Exh. "8") reached at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Alagar</st1:placename></st1:place>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Obviously angered, Juancho Takiang suddenly attacked Alfonso
with the use of the piece of wood the former carried (Exh. "6") with
a blow directed to Alfonso's head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alfonso <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>hit on his
left forearm while parrying the blow to protect his head from being hit
sustaining, in the process, injuries therein (Exh. "3") thereby
causing the scythe he used in clearing to fall from his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Juancho continued to attack but failed to hit
Alfonso who backtracked and weaved to avoid the assault and at the same time
pleaded with Juancho to stop it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
Juancho refused, it dawned on the said accused-appellant that Juancho was out
to get him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So he unsheathed his bolo
and used it in defending himself and striking back later at his attacker in
rapid succession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Juancho fell mortally
wounded with four incised wounds on various parts of his body.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The suddenness of the attack and subsequent fight petrified
the other accused-appellants, the defense witnesses and even the prosecution
witnesses to the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, no one
could shout for help and stop the fight." (PP. 2-3, Appellants' brief)</blockquote>

</span>(PP. 1-2, Appellants' brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellants that the trial court erred in ruling
that evident premeditation qualified the offense to murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evident premeditation was not alleged in the information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For evident premeditation to be considered a
qualifying circumstance, it should be positively and specifically averred in
the information (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U. S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. Campo, 23 Phil. 369; and People v. Gadiano, 115 SCRA 559).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having been proved, it can only be
appreciated as an aggravating circumstance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. Regala, 113 SCRA 613, 658; and People v. Rodil, 109 SCRA 308,
326).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants, however, are wrong in asserting that without the
qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation, the offense proved would at
most be homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">As shown by the records, discussed by the trial court, and
stressed by the Solicitor General, the appellants lay in ambush for the victim
who was on his way to his farm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
members of one group deployed themselves behind a bamboo grove while the other
group hid in the cogonal grass.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Estrella
Auditor initially emerged alone and took Takiang off-guard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The others suddenly came out of hiding
whereupon Estrello hit the victim in the eye making him stagger backward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Roy Auditor, Remegio Alvarez, and Adriano
Aparece rushed the victim and forced him to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that moment, the hacking and stabbing by Estrello
and Alfonso Auditor commenced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
attack was sudden and the appellants acted simultaneously in concert.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Juancho Takiang was unaware of the impending
attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants used methods
which insured the execution of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
crime with no risk to themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Police
Corporal </span>Eugenio Cosadio testified that when he arrived at the scene of
the killing to investigate its circumstances, he saw the foot-long working bolo
of Juancho Takiang still sheathed in its scabbard and tucked to the victim's
waist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the investigator unsheathed
it, there was no bloodstain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attack
was, therefore, so sudden and the assailants so numerous that the victim had
absolutely no opportunity to even attempt to defend himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a conscious adoption of means and
ways of insuring the execution of the crime without risk to the assailants from
any defense the victim may make.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Treachery having been alleged in the information and proved during the
trial, the crime is murder, aggravated by evident premeditation, and not
homicide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. Labinia, 115
SCRA 223; People v. Mahusay, 138 SCRA 452; People v. Macariola, 120 SCRA 92;
People v. Rhoda, 122 SCRA 909; and People v. Escoltero, 139 SCRA 218).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants allege in their second assignment of error that
the identities of Aparece and Alvarez were not proved beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They base this assigned error on
the fact that Lucio Dumo when asked to point at Aparece, pointed to Alvarez,
and when asked to point at Alvarez, pointed at Aparece.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also stress Rogelio Undag's testimony
which shows that Aparece and Alvarez were standing about a meter from Takiang,
holding the pieces of wood without using them during the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The error of the witness was in the names of the two accused and
not in regard to their having been among <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
perpetrators of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly,
the eyewitnesses were not familiar with Aparece and Alvarez who were employed
by the Auditor family to work on their farm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, it is not the ability of an eyewitness to give the true and
correct names of the accused which is important.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What matters is their identification as
persons who were seen actually committing the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The perpetrator of a crime may refuse to give
his true name or he may use a fictitious name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He can still be identified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dumo
pointed to Alvarez and Aparece as having ganged up with the Auditors on Juancho
Takiang although he made a mistake as regards their respective names.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two were not passive bystanders during
the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show that they
were active participants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
