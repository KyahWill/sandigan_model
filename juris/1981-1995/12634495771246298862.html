<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner filed a

disability is inconsistent with a grant of further medical <span style="">services.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>For once an injury or disa­bility is declared to be permanent and
total in nature, as in this case, the need for further medical treatment ceases
to exist because no amount of subsequent me­dication could restore the injured
to his maximum level of physical capacity."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

vs. Workmen's Compensation Commission,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a><span style=""> this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> vs. Republic, (L-44890,
Feb. 28, 1977), we once again reaffirmed our ruling in Ramos vs. Republic, 69
SCRA 576 (Feb. 27, 1976), that '(the) basic rule of finality of judgments is
applicable indiscriminately <span style="">to </span>one
and all and regard­less of whether respondent employer be a public or private
employer, since the rule is grounded on fundamental considerations of public
policy and sound practice that at risk of occasional error, the judgment of
courts and award of quasi-judicial agencies must become final at some definite
dated fixed by law.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All that should be
determined is whether or not the expenses were actually incurred by reason of
the injury he sustained on board the PAL plane while <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>
on official business for the Bureau of Public Schools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently there was no dispute because the
amounts incurred for medical expenses are supported by proper receipts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contention that the
petitioner is no longer entitled to be reimbursed of his medical expenses
because his physician has declared him to be totally and permanently disabled
has no merit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner has a right
to seek further improvement of his physi­cal condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also has the right to receive medical
treatment to alleviate the pain resulting from the injuries.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Order of the Secretary of Labor dated <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1977</st1:date> is hereby set aside
and the Bureau of Public Schools is ordered to pay the petitioner the amount of
P19<span class="GramE">,818.00</span> representing medical expenses he incurred
from 1972 to <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1975</st1:date>
supported by proper receipts at a proper hearing to be held for the purpose.</p>

P6,000.00 for permanent total disability, and P14,194.95 as reimbursement for
medical expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grant of lifelong
medical expenses was never the intendment of the Workmen’s Compensation Act
after compensation for permanent total disability and reimbursement for medical
