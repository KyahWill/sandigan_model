in two (2) separate informations filed by private complainant Gelen Udarbe on
March 5, 1984.  The informations read as

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on May 8, 1984, Abuyan entered a plea of not
guilty in both cases.  After trial, he
was found guilty of the two (2) crimes of rape in a decision rendered by the
trial court on February 11, 1990.  The
dispositive portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering all that has been
stated the Court finds the accused MARCOS ABUYAN, JR., guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of the crimes of rape in the two above-entitled cases penalized under the
provisions of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the commission of the crimes not having been
attended by any mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the Court hereby
sentences the accused MARCOS ABUYAN, JR., in each of the above-entitled cases,
as follows: </blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  To suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, with all the accessory
penalties prescribed by law;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  To indemnify the private offended party
Gelen Udarbe in the sum of THIRTY THOUSAND (P30,000.00) Pesos, without
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  To pay the costs." (Rollo, p. 108)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused now questions the aforementioned decision and assigns
the following as errors allegedly committed by the trial court:</p>

ACCUSED MARCOS ABUYAN, JR. GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIMES OF RAPE
AS CHARGED." (Rollo, p. 68)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as established in the People's Brief are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant and complainant, Gelen Udarbe, are first
cousins.  His mother is the sister of
her father.  In November 1983, appellant
and complainant were staying in the house of her aunt, Erlinda Pedrera, married
to Basilio Pedrera, at Pembo, Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Metro Manila.  Her father brought her to the Pedreras
sometime in May 1983 in order for her to continue with her studies.  She was only 13 years old.  Appellant, who is older by 12 years, had
been living with the Pedreras since 1982.  He was employed at Philippine Textile (TSN, July 10, 1983, pp. 3-5;
November 20, 1987, pp. 2-3; July 1, 1988, pp. 2-3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On November 1, 1983, at about 1:00 A.M., in the early dawn,
while the Pedrera spouses were not at home as they brought their sick child to
a doctor, appellant crept to her, held her right hand and pulled her hair.  Awakened and surprised, she told him: ‘Kuya,
Jr., bitiwan mo ako, ano ba ang gagawin mo sa akin, wala naman akong kasalanan
sa iyo.’ (TSN, July 10, 1984, pp. 6-7).  She related in court how she was sexually assaulted on November 1 and
16, 1983 in the following way:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"‘Q.<span style=""> </span>After telling Marcos Abuyan that you have not done anything wrong to
him, what did he do?</blockquote>

my skirt was fastened very well, Sir.  He could not pull it upward so he just pulled it downward again.</blockquote>

upward and downward and downward (sic), what hand did he use in removing your
skirt?</blockquote>

knife with his left hand, what happened to the knife when he started undressing

could not move I just started crying because, I could not do anything and he
started taking my panty off, and he was able to get my panty off, Sir.</blockquote>

removed your panty, you stood up and the accused likewise took off his brief,
is that what you mean?</blockquote>

hard for me to stand up, Sir.</blockquote>

up but after he took off his brief he pushed me again to the bed, Sir.</blockquote>

private organ, will you kindly explain to the Court, how did he force his organ
to your private part or organ?</blockquote>

panty.  I stood up and he also took off
his brief.  He came again to me and
pushed me again to bed and he came over me and spread my legs sideways and
forced to insert his organ to mine and when I felt it to be very painful, that
was the time when I lost consciousness, Sir.</blockquote>

suddenly you became unconscious, can you tell the Court what happened after
that?</blockquote>

get the knife?</blockquote>

Sir.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Pages 5 to 23, TSN
dated July 10, 1984).</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 6-12, Decision)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After she was sexually abused, appellant repeatedly warned
her not to tell anybody or he would kill her (TSN, Ibid., pp. 21-23; August 9,
1984, pp. 13 and 17; August 21, 1984, pp. 4 and 14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On November 20, 1983, complainant stopped attending her
classes at the Pateros Municipal High School where she was in first year high
school.  She was bothered by her
experience and she could no longer concentrate on her lessons (TSN, August 7,
1984, pp. 11 and 18).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From then on, her woes and misfortune continued to haunt
her.  On January 17, 1984, Gelen started
to have vaginal bleeding.  Since she had
profuse bleeding which did not stop, she was brought to the nearest physician,
Dr. Thelma Galla.  On February 10, 1984,
Dr. Galla conducted an internal examination and found that Gelen's introitus or
opening was openly admitting two fingers which means that something had been
inserted in her vagina (TSN, September 18, 1986, pp. 3-6, 8).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On February 15, 1984, Jaime Udarbe, Gelen's father, received
Erlinda Pedrera's telegram informing that something happened to Gelen.  After selling his carabao in order to raise
the needed money, he immediately left home at barrio An-an, Hinundayan,
Southern Leyte, and took the boat for Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon his arrival on February 22, 1984, Gelen confided to her
father that she was raped twice by appellant.  Jaime Udarbe, Gelen, the Pedreras and Maria Alas immediately went to the
barangay captain of Pembo, Fort Bonifacio, to report the matter.  Since the barangay captain was
uncooperative, they proceeded the following morning, on February 23, 1984 to
the Civil Relations Office (CRO) at Fort Bonifacio.  Major Pansifare, however, advised them to proceed to the Post
Provost Marshal at Camp Crame.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On February 24, 1984, in the PC Crime Laboratory at Camp Crame,
Dr. Dario Gajardo, medico-legal examiner, conducted a general and extragenital
examination on Gelen.  He found that
there was (sic) deep healed lacerations of the hymen at 6:00 o'clock and
shallow healed lacerations at 3:00 and 9:00 o'clock (TSN, April 3, 1986;
Exhibit C).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On March 1, 1984, complainant, accompanied by her father, the
Pedreras and Elsa Muli, filed her complaint against appellant before the police
authorities of the Southern Police District at Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Metro
Manila.  Corporal Ernesto Tinio took her
formal statement or 'Sinumpaang Salaysay' (Exh. A; TSN, October 25, 1984, pp.
4-6) and eventually two (2) complaints of rape were filed." (Appellees'
Brief, pp. 141-­142, 151-154)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant in his first assigned error assails the
credibility of Gelen Udarbe's testimony as not plausible, credible,
straightforward and sincere.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the appellant's contention.  The matters alleged by the accused-appellant
in support of the contention refer to minor, procedural and insignificant
details.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant's inconsistencies, if that is what they were, merely
represented minor lapses during her direct examination, which do not affect her
credibility.  Such minor lapses are to be
expected when a person is recounting details of a humiliating experience which
are painful to recall.  She was
testifying in open court in the presence of strangers, on an extremely intimate
matter, which is not normally talked about in public; such circumstances may be
expected to cause witnesses' narratives to be less than letter-perfect (People
v. Magaluna, G.R. No. 66755, January 23, 1992).</p>

<p class="BODY">The arguments of the defense to stress the complainant's alleged
lack of credibility are strained.  The
defense has labored hard trying to look for error in each and every detail of
the complainant's testimony but has come up with nothing except peripheral and
minor details.</p>

<p class="BODY">These minor inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony do not
affect her credibility (People v. Seculles, 132 SCRA 653 [1984]) especially if
what is challenged is the credibility of a fifteen year-old girl not accustomed
to public trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the court usually lends credence to testimonies of
young girls especially where the facts point to their having been victims of
sexual assault.  As held in <u>People</u>
<u>v</u>. <u>Lor</u>, 132 SCRA 41 [1984], a 15-year old unlettered girl could
not have merely concocted her rape charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gelen Udarbe, the victim in the case before us is basically a
barrio lass even if she had stayed for seven (7) months in the city.  As such, she was not yet fully exposed to
the sophistication and complexities of city life.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant further questions the reaction of the
victim during and after the rape.  He
claims that the victim did not offer verbal or tenacious resistance during the
alleged rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that there was resistance on the part of Gelen
and that force was likewise applied to her so much so that she lost
consciousness.  The accused-appellant
again questions the victim's loss of consciousness itself saying that it was an
unnatural reaction of a rape victim to lose consciousness for five (5) hours
and to go back to sleep again after regaining consciousness.</p>

<p class="BODY">A young woman who has just been sexually assaulted is not
expected to immediately regain composure as she is, at this point, confused and
dazed by the experience.  There was
nobody around to whom she could turn to after such a horrible experience.  Considering her tender age, her inaction was
quite normal.  She was alone and afraid
such that she decided to keep her sad experience to herself.  The accused-appellant finds this inaction on
the part of complainant for four (4) months questionable.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing surprising about the complainant's reaction.  She was repeatedly threatened by the accused
that he would kill her if she told anybody of the incident.  While she was not physically prevented from
going out of the house to report the incident to the authorities, the fact is
that the accused was living in the same house with her and she was repeatedly
warned that she will be killed.  This
threat on one's life is sufficient to frighten a 15-year old girl.  There was intimidation and moral ascendancy
by the accused being an older cousin.  Thus, as held in the case of <u style="">People v.
Soterol</u>, 140 SCRA 400 [1985]), complainant's delay in reporting the rape
incident due to death threats is justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">We held in the case of <u style="">People v.
Oydoc</u>, (125 SCRA 250 [1983]) that:</p>

<blockquote>"One should not expect a 14-year old girl to act like an adult
or mature and experienced woman who would know what to do under such difficult
circumstances and who would have the courage and intelligence to disregard a
threat on her life x x x and complain immediately that she had been forcibly
deflowered.  It is not uncommon for
young girls to conceal for sometime the assaults on their virtue because of the
rapists' threat on their lives x x x." (at p. 256)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This fear of the accused was clearly the reason why the victim
requested first that her father be around before she made any statement.  She needed an assurance of safety.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is important is that the trial court, which had observed the
demeanor of the witnesses during their testimonies, found the testimony of the
complainant credible.  She testified
with guts and candor with the sole objective of seeking justice for her
plight.  It has been long settled in our
jurisdiction that the findings of the trial courts will not be disturbed
considering that the latter are in a better position to evaluate testimonies,
having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their demeanor and
manner of testifying unless the trial court had overlooked or misconstrued some
material facts which if considered would affect the result (People v. Villeza,
127 SCRA 349 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the accused-appellant claims impossibility of rape on
November 1 and November 16, 1983 and his use of force and intimidation on the
victim, interposing the defense of alibi to exculpate himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant claims that he was in San Fernando,
Pampanga from November 15 to November 17 to help in the preparations for the
birthday celebration of his Auntie's son.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the defense of the accused-appellant extremely flimsy
because the distance from his place of work to San Fernando, Pampanga is a mere
2 1/2 hour-trip by bus.  There was no
need for him to go there a day before and stay there a day after.  He could leave early in the morning of
November 16 and still be on time for his cousin's party and similarly, he could
return home after the party in the afternoon of November 16.  The point is, it was not impossible for him
to commit the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The minimum requirement of the defense of alibi is physical
impossibility for the accused to be at the scene of the crime.  The accused has not met this minimum
requirement as explained in the foregoing paragraph.  Moreover, alibi is useless where the rape victim positively
identified the rapist (People v. Malabad, 133 SCRA 392 [1984]). There is no
reason to doubt the complainant's positive identification of the accused as
they had been living in the same house for seven (7) months.  What is decisive in rape cases is that
complainant identified the accused (People v. Ramilo, 146 SCRA 258 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is appellant's contention tenable that rape was
impossible to have been committed in the Pedrera house considering the number
of people living there.  The
accused-appellant has not presented other evidence except his own self-serving
declaration.  He did not even endeavor
to present any of the persons allegedly in the house.  On the contrary, the prosecution presented Erlinda Pedrera's
corroborating testimony that in the afternoon of October 31 up to the afternoon
of November 1, 1983, they were not at home because they brought their sick child
to the doctor.  The complainant further
testified that the Alases and the del Rosarios were not living in the Pedrera's
house but were staying somewhere in Mandaluyong.  This was not rebutted by the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The guilt of the accused-appellant has been proven beyond
reasonable doubt in the absence of motive on complainant's part in filing the
case.  (People v. Tumaliuan, 129 SCRA
682 [1984]).</p>
