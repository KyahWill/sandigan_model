denying petitioners' claim for tax refunds, and order the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue to refund to them their income taxes which they claim to have
been erroneously or illegally paid or collected.</p>

<p class="BODY">As summarized by the Solicitor General, the facts of the cases
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Petitioners are Filipino citizens and employees of Procter and
Gamble, Philippine Manufacturing Corporation, with offices at Sarmiento
Building, Ayala Avenue, Makati, Rizal.  Said corporation is a subsidiary of Procter &amp; Gamble, a foreign
corporation based in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A.  During the years 1970 and 1971 petitioners were assigned, for certain
periods, to other subsidiaries of Procter &amp; Gamble, outside of the
Philippines, during which petitioners were paid U.S. dollars as compensation
for services in their foreign assignments.  (Paragraphs III, Petitions for Review, C.T.A. Cases Nos. 2511 and 2594,
Exhs. D, D-1 to D-19).  When petitioners
in C.T.A. Case No. 2511 filed their income tax returns for the year 1970, they
computed the tax due by applying the dollar-to-peso conversion on the basis of
the floating rate ordained under B.I.R. Ruling No. 70-027 dated May 14, 1970,
as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">From January 1 to February 20, 1970 at the
conversion rate of P3.90 to U.S. $1.00;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">From February 21 to December 31, 1970 at
the conversion rate of P6.25 to U.S. $1.00</p>

<blockquote>Petitioners in C.T.A. Case No. 2594 likewise used the above
conversion rate in converting their dollar income for 1971 to Philippine
peso.  However, on February 8, 1973 and
October 8, 1973, petitioners in said cases filed with the office of the
respondent Commissioner, amended income tax returns for the above-mentioned
years, this time using the par value of the peso as prescribed in Section 48 of
Republic Act No. 265 in relation to Section 6 of Commonwealth Act No. 699 as
the basis for converting their respective dollar income into Philippine pesos
for purposes of computing and paying the corresponding income tax due from
them.  The aforesaid computation as
shown in the amended income tax returns resulted in the alleged overpayments,
refund and/or tax credit.  Accordingly,
claims for refund of said over-payments were filed with respondent
Commissioner.  Without awaiting the
resolution of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on their claims, petitioners
filed their petitions for review in the above-mentioned cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Commissioner filed his Answer to petitioners' petition
for review in C.T.A. Case No. 2511 on July 31, 1973, while his Answer in C.T.A.
Case No. 2594 was filed on August 7, 1974.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon joint motion of the parties on the ground that these two cases
involve common question of law and facts, the respondent Court of Tax Appeals
heard the cases jointly.  In its
decision dated September 26, 1977, the respondent Court of Tax Appeals held
that the proper conversion rate for the purpose of reporting and paying the Philippine
income tax on the dollar earnings of petitioners are the rates prescribed under
Revenue Memorandum Circulars Nos. 7-71 and 41-71.  Accordingly, the claim for refund and/or tax credit of
petitioners in the above-entitled cases was denied and the petitions for review
dismissed, with costs against petitioners.  Hence, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that public respondent Court of Tax Appeals
erred in holding:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.  That petitioners'
dollar earnings are receipts derived from foreign exchange transactions.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.  That the proper rate
of conversion of petitioners' dollar earnings for tax purposes is the
prevailing free market rate of exchange and not the par value of the peso; and</p>

<p class="BODY">3.  That the use of the
par value of the peso to convert petitioners' dollar earnings for tax purposes
into Philippine pesos is "unrealistic" and, therefore, the prevailing
free market rate should be the rate used.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner of Internal Revenue, on the other hand,
refutes petitioners' claims as follows:</p>

<blockquote>At the outset, it is submitted that the subject matter of these two
cases are Philippine income tax for the calendar years 1970 (CTA Case No. 2511)
and 1971 (CTA Case No. 2594) and, therefore, should be governed by the
provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code and its implementing rules and
regulations, and not by the provisions of Central Bank Circular No. 42 dated
May 21, 1953, as contended by petitioners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 21 of the National Internal Revenue Code, before its
amendment by Presidential Decrees Nos. 69 and 323 which took effect on January
1, 1973 and January 1, 1974, respectively, imposed a tax upon the taxable net
income received during each taxable year from all sources by a citizen of the
Philippines, whether residing here or abroad.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioners are citizens of the Philippines temporarily residing
abroad by virtue of their employment.  Thus, in their income tax returns for the period involved herein, they
gave their legal residence/address as c/o Procter &amp; Gamble PMC, Ayala Ave.,
Makati, Rizal (Annexes 'A' to 'A-8', and Annexes 'C' to 'C-8', Petition for
Review, CTA Cases Nos. 2511 and 2594).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioners being subject to Philippine income tax, their dollar
earnings should be converted into Philippine pesos in computing the income tax
due therefrom, in accordance with the provisions of Revenue Memorandum Circular
No. 7-71 dated February 11, 1971 for 1970 income and Revenue Memorandum
Circular No. 41-71 dated December 21, 1971 for 1971 income, which reiterated
BIR Ruling No. 70-027 dated May 4, 1970, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘For internal revenue tax purposes, the free market rate of
conversion (Revenue Circulars Nos. 7-71 and 41-71) should be applied in order
to determine the true and correct value in Philippine pesos of the income of
petitioners.’<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful examination of the records, the laws involved and
the jurisprudence on the matter, We are inclined to agree with respondents
Court of Tax Appeals and Commissioner of Internal Revenue and thus vote to deny
the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is basically an income tax case.  For the proper resolution of these cases income may be defined as
an amount of money coming to a person or corporation within a specified time,
whether as payment for services; interest or profit from investment.  Unless otherwise specified, it means cash or
its equivalent.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Income can also be thought of as a flow of the fruits of one's labor.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners are correct as to their claim that their dollar
earnings are not receipts derived from foreign exchange transactions.  For a foreign exchange transaction is simply
that -- a transaction in foreign exchange, foreign exchange being "the
conversion of an amount of money or currency of one country into an equivalent
amount of money or currency of another."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
When petitioners were assigned to the foreign subsidiaries of Procter &amp;
Gamble, they were earning in their assigned nation's currency and were ALSO
spending in said currency.  There was no
conversion, therefore, from one currency to another.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent Court of Tax Appeals did err when it concluded that
the dollar incomes of petitioner fell under Section 2(f)(g) and (m) of C.B.
Circular No.42.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue now is, what exchange rate should be used to determine
the peso equivalent of the foreign earnings of petitioners for income tax
purposes.  Petitioners claim that since
the dollar earnings do not fall within the classification of foreign exchange
transactions, there occurred no actual inward remittances, and, therefore, they
are not included in the coverage of Central Bank Circular No. 289 which provides
for the specific instances when the par value of the peso shall <u>not</u> be
the conversion rate used.  They conclude
that their earnings should be converted for income tax purposes using the par
value of the Philippine peso.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commissioner argues that CB Circular No. 289 speaks of
receipts for export products, receipts of sale of foreign exchange or foreign
borrowings and investments but not income tax.  He also claims that he had to use the prevailing free market rate of
exchange in these cases because of the need to ascertain the true and correct
amount of income in Philippine peso of dollar earners for Philippine income tax
purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful reading of said CB Circular No. 289<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
shows that the subject matters involved therein are export products,
invisibles, receipts of foreign exchange, foreign exchange payments, new
foreign borrowing investments -- nothing by way of income tax payments Thus;
petitioners are in error by concluding that since C.B. Circular No. 289 does
not apply to them, the par value of the peso should be the guiding rate used
for income tax purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dollar earnings of petitioners are the fruits of their labors
in the foreign subsidiaries of Procter &amp; Gamble.  It was a definite amount of money which came to them within a
specified period of time of two years as payment for their services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 21 of the National Internal Revenue Code, amended up to
August 4,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1969, states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 21. <i>Rates of tax on citizens or residents. - </i>A tax is
hereby imposed upon the taxable net income received during each taxable year
from all sources by every individual, whether a citizen of the Philippines
residing therein or abroad or an alien residing in the Philippines, determined
in accordance with the following schedule:</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And in the implementation for the proper enforcement of the
National Internal Revenue Code, Section 338 thereof empowers the Secretary of
Finance to "promulgate all needful rules and regulations" to
effectively enforce its provisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this authority, Revenue Memorandum Circular Nos. 7-71<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and 41-71<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
were issued to prescribe a uniform rate of exchange from US dollars to
Philippine pesos for INTERNAL REVENUE TAX PURPOSES for the years 1970 and 1971,
respectively.  Said revenue circulars
were a valid exercise of the authority given to the Secretary of Finance by the
Legislature which enacted the Internal Revenue Code. And these are presumed to
be a valid interpretation of said code until revoked by the Secretary of
Finance himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that since there were no remittances and
acceptances of their salaries and wages in US dollars into the Philippines,
they are exempt from the coverage of such circulars.  Petitioners forget that they are citizens of the Philippines, and
their income, within or without, and in these cases wholly without, are subject
to income tax.  Sec. 21, NIRC, as
amended, does not brook any exemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since petitioners have already paid their 1970 and 1971 income
taxes under the uniform rate of exchange prescribed under the aforestated
Revenue Memorandum Circulars, there is no reason for respondent Commissioner to
refund any taxes to petitioner as said Revenue Memorandum Circulars, being of
long standing and not contrary to law, are valid.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although it has become a worn-out cliché, the fact still remains
that "taxes are the lifeblood of the government" and one of the
duties of a Filipino citizen is to pay his income tax.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are denied for lack of
merit.  The dismissal by the respondent
Court of Tax Appeals of petitioners' claims for tax refunds for the income tax
period for 1970 and 1971 is AFFIRMED.  Costs against petitioners.</p>
