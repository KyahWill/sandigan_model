				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review and reverse the decision of the Court
of Appeals in CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 64767-R promulgated on <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1981</st1:date>, which absolved the
Manila Gas Corporation from paying interest on a money claim to the plaintiff
who is the petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The factual and legal
antecedents are stated in the decision sought to be reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The basic action in the instant case was filed by <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pleno</span>, hereinafter
referred to as the plaintiff, against Manila Gas Corporation, hereinafter
referred to as defendant, for sum of money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff had been an employee of the Manila Gas Corporation and was
separated from the service effective <st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="7">July
 16, 1954</st1:date> following an administrative case instituted by the de­fendant
against the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He appealed the
decision to the Office of the President and on October 10, 1956, the
defendant's decision was modified in the sense that the plaintiff was merely
considered resigned with right to salary on date of his suspension to the date
of receipt of the money value of his accumulated vacation and sick leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following receipt of such decision from the
Of­fice of the President, plaintiff made motions for the implementation thereof
to no avail until finally he filed the basic complaint on <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant in their answer denied the
material allegations of the plaintiff and in the trial before the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, it pleaded as its principal defense the fact that the cause of
plaintiff against the defendant had already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the issues were joined, trial proceeded
and the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed the complaint on <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's motion for reconsideration was
also denied on <st1:date year="1977" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1977</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The petitioners challenged the foregoing order in a Petition
for <i>Certiorari</i> before the Court of Appeals docketed as CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. <span class="GramE">SP-06926.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the resolution thereof, this Court found
that the cause of the plaintiff did not prescribe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It consequently annulled and set aside the
challenged orders 'insofar as they dismiss petitioners' action to enforce the
decision of the Office of the President dated <st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1956</st1:date>.' Upon the remand of the records to the
court of origin, the de­fendant immediately complied by paying the plaintiff
the sum of P24<span class="GramE">,672.83</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The check representing the amount was received by the plaintiff in open
court on <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, however, reserved the right to
demand interest which the defendant denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the matter was sufficiently discussed before the court of origin,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered judgment for the plaintiff as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Interest at the rate of 6% per annum commenced to accrue upon the
principal of P24,672.83 on May 30, 1957, until July 29, 1974, when legal
interest became 12% in ac­cordance with Central Bank Circular No. 416 <span style="">issued pursuant to Presidential Decrees Nos.
116 and 858.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interest at 6% for a
period of from May 30, 1957 to July 29, </span><span style="">1974 </span><span style="">a period of 17 years, 1 month and 29 days, amounts to P25<span class="GramE">,408.90</span>, while interest of 12% from July 29, 1974, up to the
filing of the complaint on November 15, 1976, a period of 2 years, 3 months,
and 16 days, totals P6,793.19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
amount due the plaintiff on interest alone on the date of the institution of
this suit was P32<span class="GramE">,202</span>. 09.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'Award of attorney's fees as damages is <span style="">a matter </span>of discretion on the part of the Court ( De la Cruz v.

maliciously but in good faith, as the defendant </span><span style="">had </span><span style="">done in contesting
the claim of the plaintiff o</span>n <span style="">its
</span><span style="">in­</span><span style="">terpretation of the law, the Court is
justified in refusing assessment of attorney’s fees (Ramos v. Ramos, 61 </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">SCRA</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">284,306).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

assess </span>any interest payment, there <span style="">should
have been no interest assessment in the judgment appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the Court of Appeals required the enforcement of the
decision of the Office of the President dated </span><st1:date year="1956" day="10" month="10"><span style="">October 10, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

money value of your accumulated vacation and sick-leaves.' The de­cision of the
Court of Appeals was silent regarding interest.<span style="">&nbsp;

"</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We cannot accept the <span style="">rationale
</span>and decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rationale is that since its decision in <span style="">CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. SP</span>-0<span style="">6926 "</span>was silent <span style="">regarding </span>interest" and the same
having <span style="">become "final and </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">executory</span></span><span style="">" without </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pleno</span>) therein fil</span><span style="">ing </span><span style="">a motion for reconsideration, an award of interest </span><span style="">would substantially modify </span><span style="">the final judgment something which </span><span style="">cannot be done</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">under the </span><span style="">doctrine laid down in Robles vs. <span class="SpellE">Timario</span>, 107 Phil. 809 </span><span style="">[1960].<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not believe that Robles vs. <span class="SpellE">Timario</span>
is applicable to the case at bar and <span style="">that
</span>the award of interest to the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pleno</span>
will have the effect of modifying the judgment of the Court of Appeals in CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. SP-06926 because the only issue decided in <span style="">that case</span> was whether <span style="">or</span> not <span class="SpellE">Pleno's</span>
claim<span style=""> against</span><span style=""> Manila Gas </span><span style="">Cor</span><span style="">poration had </span><span style="">prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals was not asked to
determine and in fact did not determine whether or not <span class="SpellE">Pleno</span>
was entitled to the amount claimed by him and for this reason the same court
could not have made any pronouncement with respect to </span><span style="">interest </span><span style="">due on his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The </span><span style="">Court of Appeals' judgment which attained finality merely reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
