alleged amount of P50,000.00 to <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span>; that the
tractor was received by Rivera only on January 23, 1971 and not in 1970 as

surety bond issued by ICP.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the outset, it will be
noted that petitioners' submission under the first assigned error hinges purely
</span><span style="">on </span><span style="">questions of fact. Respondent Court of Appeals made several findings to
the effect that the questioned documents are valid and binding-upon the
parties, that there was no fraud employed by private respondents in the
execution thereof, and that, contrary to petitioners’ allegation, the evidence
on record reveals that petitioners had every intention to be bound by their
undertakings in the various transactions had with private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a general rule in this jurisdiction
that findings of fact of said appellate court are final and conclusive and,
thus, binding on this Court in the absence of sufficient and convincing proof, </span><u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, </span><span style="">that </span>the <span style="">former acted

the circumstances, we find no compelling reason to deviate from this
long-standing jurisprudential pronouncement.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In addition, the alleged
failure of Rivera to pay the consideration agreed upon in the Sales Agreement,
which clearly constitutes </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">breach of the contract, cannot be availed of </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the guilty party to justify and support an action for the declaration
of nullity of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equity and
fair play dictates that one who commits a breach of his contract may not seek
refuge under the protective mantle of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The evidence of record,
on an overall calibration, does not convince </span><span style="">us </span><span style="">of the validity of

either absolutely simulated or downright fraudulent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

simulation of contract is the fact that the apparent contract is not really
desired or intended to either produce legal effects or in any way alter the
juridical situation of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
subsequent act of Rivera in receiving and making use of the tractor subject
matter of the Sales Agreement and Chattel Mortgage, and the simultaneous
issuance of a surety bond in favor of <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span>,
concomitant with the execution of the Agreement of Counter-Guaranty with
Chattel/Real Estate Mortgage, conduce to the conclusion that petitioners had
every intention to be bound by these contracts.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, petitioners
seek to pierce the veil of, corporate entity of <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span>,
ICP and PM Parts, alleging that these corporations employed fraud in causing
the foreclosure and subsequent sale of the real properties belonging to
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we do not discount
the possibility of the existence of fraud in the foreclosure proceedings,
neither are we inclined to apply the doctrine invoked by pe</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">itioners
</span><span style="">in </span><span style="">granting the relief sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is our considered opinion that piercing the veil of corporate entity is not the
proper remedy in order that the foreclosure proceeding may be declared a
nullity under the circumstances obtaining in the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the legal corporate entity is disregarded
only if it is sought to hold the officers and stockholders directly liable for
a corporate debt or obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case, petitioners do not seek <span style="">to
impose </span>a claim against the individual members of the three corporations
involved; on the contrary, it is these corporations which desire to enforce an
alleged right against petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assuming that petitioners were indeed defrauded by private respondents <span style="">in</span><span style=""> </span>the foreclos<span style="">u</span>re
of mortgaged properties, this fact alone is not, under the circumstances,
sufficient to justify the piercing of the corporate fiction, since petitioners
do not intend to hold the officers and/or members of respondent corporations
personally liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners are merely seeking the
declaration of the nullity of the foreclosure sale, which relief may be
obtained without having to disregard the aforesaid corporate fiction attaching
to respondent corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
petitioners failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that private
respondents were purposely formed and operated, and thereafter transacted with petitioners,
with the sole intention of defrauding the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mere fact, therefore, that the businesses of two or more
corporations are interrelated is not a justification for disregarding their
separate personalities,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>

shield to defraud creditors and third persons of their rights. <span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main issue for
resolution is whether there was a valid foreclosure of the mortgaged properties
by ICP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners argue that the
foreclosure proceedings should be declared null and void for two reasons,
viz.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) no written notice was
furnished by <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span> to ICP anent the failure of <span class="SpellE">Slobec</span> in paying <span style="">its
</span>obligation with the former, plus the fact that no receipt was presented
to show the amount allegedly paid by ICP to <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span>;
and (b) at the time of the foreclosure of the mortgage, the liability of ICP
under the surety bond had already expired.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent court, in
finding for the validity of the </span>foreclosure sale, declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Now to the question of whether or not the foreclosure by the
ICP of the real estate mortgage was in the exercise of a legal right, We agree
with the appellants that the foreclosure proceedings instituted by the ICP <span style="">was </span>in the exercise of a legal
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, ICP has in its favor the
legal presumption that it had indemnified <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span>
by reason of <span class="SpellE">Slobec's</span> default <span style="">in </span>the payment of its obligation under the Sales Agreement,
especially because <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span> consented to <span class="SpellE">ICP's</span> foreclosure of the mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This presumption is <span style="">in </span>consonance with pars.

have been fair and regular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it
is disputably presumed that the ordinary course of business has been
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, ICP had the right to
proceed at once to the foreclosure of the mortgage as mandated by the
provisions of Art. 2071 Civil Code for these further reasons: <span class="SpellE">Slobec</span>, the principal debtor, was admittedly insolvent; <span class="SpellE">Slobec's</span> obligation becomes demandable by reason of the <span style="">expiration </span>of the period of payment;
and its authorization to foreclose the mortgage upon <span class="SpellE">Slobec's</span>
default, which resulted in the accrual of <span class="SpellE">ICP's</span>
liability to <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third, the Agreement of Counter Guaranty with
Real Estate Mortgage (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. I) expressly grants to ICP
the right to foreclose the real estate mortgage <span style="">in </span>the event of ‘non-payment or non-liquidation of the entire

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, the
allegation of ICP that it has paid <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span> is not

</span>Section 1, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court provides that the burden of

<p class="NUM">2. The liability of a surety is measured <span style="">by </span>the terms of his contract, and, while he is liable to the full

enlarged by an unauthorized extension thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>

failed to file a written claim against it within thirty (30) days from the

must be noted that Modesto N. Cervantes served as Vice-President of <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span> and, later, as President of PM Parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this fact alone, it cannot be said that PM
