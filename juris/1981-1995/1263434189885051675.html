<blockquote>The circumstances of his apprehension, as testified to by the
arresting officer Valenzuela Patrolman Eduardo Fajardo is (sic) substantially
as follows:  In the morning of September
20, 1987, Cpl. Martin of the Valenzuela Police Anti-Narcotics Unit ordered him
and Pat. Albao to conduct buy/bust operations with the help of a civilian informer
(CI) <span style="">at </span>Gen. T. de Leon Street,
Valenzuela, Metro Manila.  The operation's
target was a certain pusher, Boy Hapon.  Arriving the (sic) place, he was introduced by the CI to Boy Hapon, the
herein accused.  Posing <span style="">as </span>buyer (sic), he handed a marked
P10.00 bill to the accused and the latter put it inside his pocket.  The accused told him to wait and went (sic)
to a house besides <span style="">(sic) </span>the
road about ten meters away to get the merchandise.  Minutes later, the accused returned and handed to him the
merchandise consisting of five (5) marijuana cigarette sticks wrapped in a
(sic) plastic (Exhibits A, A-1 to A-4).  He identified himself to the accused as a police officer.  He placed the accused under arrest and
retrieved from the latter the P10.00 bill he paid (Exhibit E) with his initials
on it (Exh. E-1).  That (sic) they
brought the accused to their headquarters for investigation; that he gave a
written statement in connection with the incident (Exh. F, F-1).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On cross-examinations (sic), he testified that they rode the
private vehicle owned by Pat. Albao in going to Gen T. de Leon St.; that he has
been in the place twice; that <span style="">the </span>residents
of Gen. <span style="">T. </span>de Leon do not know
him as a policeman; that he was in civilian clothes; that he placed his
initials on the P10.00 bill before leaving their office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>NBI forensic chemist Resurreccion Ramos affirmed that the seized
five (5) cigarette sticks (Exhs. A, A-1 to A-4) submitted for examinations were
positive for marijuana (Exh. B, B-1).  Microscopic, chemical and chromatographic tests were conducted yielding
(sic) the same result (Exhs. C, C-1 to C-4).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On cross-examinations, (sic) she testified that P/Aide Ludwig Lee
brought the specimens to their office with the written request for examination
from the Valenzuela Police Station (Exh. D).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused denied selling marijuana cigarettes to Pat. Fajardo.  He knows Fajardo to be a policeman for more
than five years.  He knows Fajardo
because he used to see him in the house of a policeman living in their place at
Gen. T. de Leon; that he is (sic) a truck helper of gravel and sand for about
ten years; that on September 20, 1987 at around 11:30 in the morning, he was in
front of the house of his aunt at Gen. T. de Leon washing the truck when Pat.
Fajardo arrived and (sic) holding something wrapped in a (sic) plastic; that
Pat. Fajardo suddenly pulled him at the waistline at the back of his pants and
asked him if he has marijuana.  He
replied that he is not selling marijuana.  Fajardo pushed him and asked him to go with them.  Pat. Fajardo had two other companions; that
the marijuana came from them (Pat. Fajardo and companions); that he replied
that he cannot go with them because he has not done anything wrong.  He was hit by <span style="">a </span>gun in the head.  He
was brought to the Polo Emergency Hospital on the same day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On cross-examinations (sic), he said that he do (sic) not have any
misunderstanding/ill feeling with Pat. Fajardo before the incident; that Pat.
Fajardo failed to locate the person whom they were intending to arrest and
turned his ire on him; that Pat. Fajardo asked him to point to the person that
was selling marijuana; that he do (sic) not know the person and he has no
relation with him; that three (3) days before he was arrested, Pat. Fajardo had
already asked him to point the (sic) person selling marijuana in the
place."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant assigns the following errors committed by the trial
court:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">I</span>. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING
CREDENCE TO THE CONFLICTING AND UNCORROBORATED TESTIMONY OF PAT. EDUARDO
FAJARDO.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">II</span>. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING
ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE HIS GUILT BEYOND
REASONABLE DOUBT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Discussing these jointly for the sake of brevity, appellant
states that the uncorroborated testimony of Pat. Fajardo should be examined and
scrutinized carefully considering that it is the only basis for his conviction;
he claims that it is doubtful whether the buy-bust operation itself was
actually conducted because Pat. Fajardo's testimony reveals that there was
virtually a one man show wherein he acted as poseur-buyer and arresting officer
at the same time.  Appellant finds it
odd that Fajardo's alleged companion during the buy-bust operation, Pat. Aldao,
had no participation at all therein.  Accordingly, it is suggested that the entire operation was highly
suspect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further contends that the testimony of Pat. Fajardo is
full of inconsistencies, to wit:  a)
Initially, during direct examination, Fajardo testified that when the appellant
asked for payment, he waited first for the latter to bring back the marijuana
before giving the money; on further examination, Fajardo stated that he paid at
once; b) During direct examination, he testified that he met the accused <span style="">"on </span>the road where there was
(sic) a bridge;" during cross examination, he said that he met the accused
beside a house under construction which is located beyond the bridge; c) On
direct examination he stated that he waited for the appellant for sometime
before the latter came back, while on cross examination, he claimed that he only
waited for two (2) minutes before the latter returned; and d) During direct
examination, he failed to mention that he had marked the buy-bust money before
leaving the office, while on cross examination, he testified that he made a
marking on the bill before leaving the office.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> While
admitting that these inconsistencies <span style="">refer
to minor details, he </span>asserts, however, that since the prosecution's case
is anchored solely on Pat. Fajardo's testimony, said inconsistencies affect the
latter's credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant declares that the amount of P10.00 is
inadequate for the five (5) sticks of marijuana he allegedly sold and it is
improbable that he would risk his life and liberty for the measly sum of
P10.00; besides, he knew that at that time, Pat. Fajardo had been a policeman
in their place for five (5) years.  Thus, it is inconceivable that he would sell marijuana to the latter.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The primal issue then is the credibility of Pat. Fajardo's
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual findings of the trial court are generally accorded
great respect by appellate courts particularly on matters of credibility of
witnesses, since the trial judge is given the opportunity to observe the
attitude and deportment of the witnesses while listening to them speak.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
An exception to this rule obtains when certain facts of substance and value
have been overlooked which, if considered, would affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>In the case at bar, the trial court,
after<span style=""> </span>evaluating the evidence
before it, found the testimony of Pat. Fajardo credible and convincing.  It said:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court has very closely examined the evidence of the
contending sides, including the deportment and demeanor of those who took the
witness stand and it is convinced that herein accused is guilty of
transgressing the Dangerous Drugs Act.  The testimony of the arresting officer, Valenzuela Patrolman Eduardo
Fajardo was clear, positive and credible.  He testified that after being introduced to the accused as buyer, he
handed the marked P10.00<span style=""> </span><span style="">bill </span>to the accused.  That the accused asked him to wait and upon
his (accused) return from a house located near the road about <span style="">10 </span>meters away, the accused handed to
him the prohibited stuffs, consisting of five (5) marijuana cigarette sticks
wrapped in a (sic) plastic (Exhibits <span style="">A, </span>A-1
to A-4).  That he recovered from the
accused the <span style="">P10.00 </span>bill he paid
(Exh. E) with his initials on it (Exh. E-1); that the prohibited stuffs were
found positive<span style=""> </span>for marijuana <span style="">(Exhs. </span>C, C-1 to C-4)."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find no
compelling reason to overturn such findings.  <span style="">A </span>meticulous review and <span style="">a<i> </i></span>careful evaluation of the
records of this case show that the same are firmly supported by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">That Pat. Fajardo's testimony is uncorroborated is of no moment
for settled <span style="">is </span>the rule that the
testimony of a lone prosecution eyewitness, as long as credible and positive,
can prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies in Pat. Fajardo's testimony either do
not exist or are merely exaggerated.  The first alleged inconsistency is based on the following exchange:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL VICENTE:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
you told the accused that you want to 'Iiskor kami', what happened next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
told me 'May I have your money then'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
what did you do after he asked for your money?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
just waited because he left for some time and he circled around <span style="">a </span>house that was for rent.”<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon further examination, he stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  When you were asked a while ago what did you do when the accused
asked for the money and you said he left you, you mentioned about the payment?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
I have (sic) remarked 'Iiskor kami', he replied, 'Akina ang pera'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At

bill.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
what did the accused to (sic) with the money which you gave to him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
placed it in <span style="">his </span>pocket and
after that, he left us."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no inconsistency in the abovequoted testimony.  It seems that when Pat. Fajardo was
initially asked what he did when the appellant asked for the payment, he failed
to answer the question directly; instead, Pat. Fajardo said that the appellant
left to get the marijuana.  He, however,
never mentioned that he gave the money to the appellant only upon the latter's
return.  When further examined, it
becomes apparent that Pat. Fajardo actually gave the P10.00 bill at once,
before the appellant left to get the marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another inconsistency, as claimed by the appellant, may be
observed from Pat. Fajardo's account of how he met the appellant.  Upon direct examination, Pat. Fajardo
declared:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL VICENTE:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
the way, in what exact place in T. de Leon did you have contact with the
accused?<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
the road where there was (sic) a bridge."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On cross examination, he testified thus:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. VIERNES:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
when you went to T. de Leon on September 20, 1987, you said you have (sic) met
this Boy Hapon, where did you meet him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  If this is the road, ahead is the bridge and after that, there was a
house that is under construction.  And
this house which is under construction is also near a four-door apartment and
that is where I met or saw this Boy Hapon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
mean in front of the house under construction?<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
the side."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pat. Fajardo's initial statement does not establish that he met
the appellant on the bridge itself but rather on the road leading to the
bridge.  Hence, there is no real
inconsistency when Fajardo later declared that he actually met the appellant at
the side of a house under construction because said house stands beside that
same road.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim -- that Pat. Fajardo's failure to state during the direct
examination that he marked the buy-bust money with his initials before leaving
the office is inconsistent with his later statement during cross examination
that he in fact marked the buy-bust money before leaving the office -- is
preposterous and absurd.  Such failure
was due to the fact that the prosecuting fiscal did not ask the proper
question.  It was only during cross
examination that such <span style="">a </span>question
was posed, thereby eliciting the said response.  Appellant's counsel clarified the matter and merely provided the
witness an opportunity to furnish the details.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last inconsistency adverted to by the appellant involves the
statements during <span style="">(a) </span>direct
examination of <span style="">Pat. </span>Fajardo that
he waited for sometime for the appellant to return after leaving to get the
marijuana, and (b) cross examination where he stated that he only waited for
about two (2) minutes before the appellant returned with the marijuana.  What needs to be determined here, in order
to establish an inconsistency, is the import of the word
"sometime".  Concededly,
"sometime" is a relative term.  Nevertheless, whether it could mean thirty (30) minutes, one (1) hour or
even two (2) minutes, the inconsistency, if any, is very minor and not
substantial.  In any event, the cross
examination merely allowed <span style="">the </span>witness
to elucidate and explain what he meant when he used such a term.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming <i><span style="">arguendo</span></i><span style=""> </span>that discrepancies existed in Pat.
Fajardo'<span style="">s</span> testimony, they were
discrepancies concerning minor details which do not impair his credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The most candid of witnesses oftentimes makes mistakes but such honest lapses
do not necessarily impair his testimony's intrinsic credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In <i>People vs. Reception,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> We
held:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the course of <span style="">a </span>prolonged
direct examination, more so, during cross-<span style="">examination,
</span>the witness <span style="">is </span>usually
subjected to unfriendly questioning.  As
a result, it is usually the case that the witness, uncomfortable and fidgety in
a courtroom scene, may often fall into lapses.  It <span style="">is </span>not infrequent for <span style="">a </span>witness to make minor mistakes in
his narration of facts; the intimidating presence of the opposing counsel
coupled by the verbose and misleading manner of questioning are factors
determinant of these inconsistencies."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The failure of Pat. Fajardo to mention the role of Pat. Aldao in
the buy-bust operation <span style="">is </span>inconsequential;
moreover, Pat. Fajardo's acting as the poseur-buyer and arresting officer at
the same time is not at all odd.  As a
matter of fact, in buy-bust operations where the poseur-buyer is also a member
of the buy-bust team, it would be even more convenient and effective for said
poseur-buyer to arrest the drug pusher after the latter gives him the
prohibited drug.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is there merit in the appellant's claim that it is
improbable that he would risk his life and liberty for the measly sum of
P10.00.  The commission of the offense
of illegal sale of marijuana requires merely the consummation of the
transaction where the poseur-buyer receives the marijuana from the seller.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The monetary consideration agreed upon by the parties is immaterial in
establishing the fact of sale of prohibited drugs.  The question as to whether appellant would risk his life and
liberty for the measly sum of P10.00 is obviously to be answered in the
positive.  Drug pushers, especially
small quantity or retail pushers, sell their prohibited wares to anyone who can
pay for the same, be they strangers or not.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Equally untenable is the appellant's claim that it was impossible
for him to have sold marijuana to Pat. Fajardo since he knew the latter to be a
policeman.  Even assuming <i>arguendo</i>
that said statement is true, what matters in drug pushing cases is not <span style="">t</span>he existing familiarity between the
seller and the buyer, but their agreement and the acts constituting the sale
and delivery of the marijuana leaves.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

dismissed by the trial court as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court finds the accused’ (sic) story that he was brought

stuffs.  A plan of a buy/bust operation
was set up for his apprehension.  He
handed the prohibited stuffs to the witness, Pat. Fajardo and the money used in
the operation was recovered from him (accused) bears (sic) the initials of the
arresting officer.  He, therefore, could
not just have been framed up as claimed by him.  His claim that he was charged because he did not point to the
arresting officer the person who was selling the prohibited stuffs in the place
is not convincing.  He testified that he
has no misunderstanding with the arresting officer Pat. Fajardo prior to the
incident.  He said that he has not associated
nor have (sic) any relation with the person sought by the police officers for
selling prohibited stuffs in the place and he did not even know the person, why
was he singled out to point to the person?  Of significance was his unexplained failure or <span style="">omission </span>to give his statement denouncing the alleged actu<span style="">a</span>tions of the apprehending officer and
to show that he was indicted for a crime he did not commit, which is the
natural reaction <span style="">of </span>one who is
being falsely charged of an offense as an act of self-preservation.  The version of the arresting officer was
more convincing.  There appears no
compelling reason why his testimony should not be believed or discarded.  The accused has not shown any convincing
facts or circumstances from which it could be reasonably inferred that this
witness falsely testified or was actuated by improper motives.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the defense of frame up requires stronger proof
because of the presumption that public officers acted in the regular
performance of their official duties.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Since no ill motive on the part of Pat. Fajardo was proven by the appellant, this
presumption was not overthrown.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the affirmance of the trial court's decision <span style="">is </span>in order.  However, the penalty imposed, which <span style="">is </span><i><span style="">reclusion </span>perpetua,
</i><span style="">is </span>incorrect because the
penalty provided in Section 4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended,
is life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P20,000.00 to <span style="">P30,000.00.  </span><i>Reclusion Perpetua,</i> a penalty provided for in appropriate
cases under the Revised Penal Code and which carries accessory penalties, is
completely different from life imprisonment.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
