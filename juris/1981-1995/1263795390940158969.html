				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Norman <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span> was found
guilty by the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del Norte, Branch I, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City, of the crime of
Murder for the death of one Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <b><u>reclusion</u></b>
<span class="SpellE"><b><u>perpetua</u></b></span> and to pay the heirs of the
victim the sum of P12,000.00 and the cost of suit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

On appeal, this Court affirmed said judgment with the modification that the
civil liability should be increased to P30,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

trial, citing as grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[1] the discovery of new and material
evidence; [2] errors of law or irregularities committed during the trial
prejudicial to his substantive rights as an accused; and, [3] interest of
substantial justice and avoidance of a failure of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
thru the Solicitor-General opposes said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The newly-discovered evidence relied upon by accused-appellant
consists of the testimonies of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>, Jr.,
Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Amparado</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While, as contended by the Solicitor, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Amparado</span> could not be
considered as newly-discovered nor could it materially affect the judgment,
said testimony being merely cumulative in character, We find the proposed
testimonies of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>, Jr., and Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span> to be newly-discovered and of sufficient weight and
character as to alter the outcome of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his affidavit attached to the motion under consideration,
accused-appellant explained in detail why the evidence could not, even with the
use of reasonable diligence, be presented at the trial and how he happened to
discover them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of
his affidavit reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Q

defense as shown in the case record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to the evidence on record, the
prosecution contended that late Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> was
stabbed by you, by means of treachery, while he was walking in the road; while
you contended that you stabbed Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> in
self-defense and/or to repel his unlawful aggression in the house where you
were staying as a boarder; during the trial were you able to produce or present
as witness or witnesses any person or persons who were the first to render
assistance to the deceased immediately after the incident in the house?</blockquote>

any witness or witnesses who may be in the road while the incident was taking
place in the house and when Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> went out
to the road after having been stabbed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why, please state the reason when according
to you, you exerted earnest effort and reasonable diligence to produce evidence

normal">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because I did not know then of any person or persons who
were in the road and able to render assistance to late Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> after he was stabbed, considering that after the
stabbing in self-defense, I was just inside the house; when I went with the
Policemen that same evening, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> was no
longer there and during the trial and the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the appeal, I did not go back to the scene, premises and environment of the
incident at <span class="SpellE">Estaka</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>
City, to gather information as to the possibility of any person or persons who
might have rendered assistance to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span>
after he was stabbed in the house or who could be present in the road when the
incident happened, for fear of retaliation from his relatives and friends,
especially that I received information that they were hunting me.</blockquote>

Jr. and Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span>?</blockquote>

Jr. in <st1:place>Saint Vincent</st1:place>'s College where I was studying but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:normal">we </span>were
never friends; but I have never known Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span>.</blockquote>

normal">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:

College for eight <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">[8] </span>years and
I stayed and lived in our home place in <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dapitan</span> City and I did not go to Saint Vincent's College
premises within those years due to my fear of retaliation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When I resumed my studies in the school year
1977-1978, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>, Jr. was no longer studying
in said school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And I did not meet him
again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When, for the first time did you discover
that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>, Jr. and Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span> were present in the road in front of the home of <span class="SpellE">Deling</span> Velasco when the incident between Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> and you happened in the house where you were
boarding and that they were the first persons who rendered assistance to Manuel
<span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> after he was wounded by you in self-defense
or to repel his unlawful aggression?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only after I received a copy of the decision
of the Honorable Supreme Court on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1985</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How did you discover it?</blockquote>

to look for a lawyer for an advice or consultation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Coincidentally, I met <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ladera</span> who was one of the prosecution witnesses and I
<span class="SpellE">regretably</span> told him that I was convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment principally due to the testimony of Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Patangan</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Ladera</span> told me that it was surprising for the reason that
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Patangan</span> was not present during the incident,
it was a certain Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>, Jr. and his
companion who were present based on what he knew.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And so, what did you do then?</blockquote>

earnest effort to contact Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When I have contacted him, he related to me
everything about the incident of April 1, 1969 involving the late Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> and he told me farther that he and Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span> were there present and they were the first persons who
were able to render assistance to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Maghanoy</span> and
that the person named Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Patangan</span> was not there
present.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When did you met [sic] <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ladera</span>?</blockquote>

some few days until I was able to contact Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>,
Jr. and Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How were you able to contact Manuel Henry<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> <span class="SpellE">Auza</span>?</span><i><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, there can be no doubt that the
evidence sought to be presented are newly-discovered as defined by the Rules of
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the proposed
testimonies of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>, Jr. and Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span>, who aver to be the first persons to render assistance
to the victim immediately after the stabbing incident, if admitted, would tend
to show that the alleged eyewitness Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Patangan</span>,
whose version of the crime was given full faith and credence by the trial court
and sustained by this Court, was not present at the scene of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
If this is true, then, the version of the prosecution might perforce fail and
that of the defense prevail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the judgment of conviction could be reversed, or at the
very least, modified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding that the evidence sought to be presented by
accused-appellant conforms to the requisites laid down by Section 2[b] of Rule
121 of the Rules of Court, the Court Resolved to <b>GRANT</b>
accused-appellant's motion for new trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the judgment of this Court dated <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1985</st1:date> is reconsidered and
set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of the trial
court dated April 11, 1978 is likewise set aside and the records of the case
are remanded to the lower court for new trial pursuant to Rule 121, Section
5[b] and [c] of the Rules of Court, at which the evidence already taken shall
stand and the testimonies of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Cachin</span>, Jr. and
Manuel Henry <span class="SpellE">Auza</span> and such other evidence of both
prosecution and defense as the trial court may in the interest of justice allow
to be introduced, shall be taken and considered with the evidence already in
the record, and a new judgment thereafter rendered by the lower court.</p>
