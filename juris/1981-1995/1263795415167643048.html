<p class="BODY">In a suit for damages arising from <span>a </span>vehicular 
accident filed by private respondent against petitioners before the Regional 
Trial Court, Branch XXIII, at <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, a summary judgment was rendered adverse to 
petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>Copy of the Decision was received by petitioners on 
<st1:date month="7" day="23" year="1985">July 23, 1985</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>On August 6, 1985, or one day before the end of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to appeal, petitioners filed a Motion 
for Extension of Time within which to file a Motion for Reconsideration.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The Trial Court denied the Motion on the ground that the period within 
which to file a motion for reconsideration cannot be extended.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>That ruling was affirmed by respondent Appellate Court on January 8, 
1986, following the original <span class="SpellE"><em>Habaluyas</em></span><em> 
vs. Judge Japzon</em> case promulgated by this Court on August 5, 1985 (138 SCRA 
46), where it was held that "the fifteen-day period for appealing or for filing 
a motion for reconsideration cannot be extended".</p>
<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, or on <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1986">May 30, 1986</st1:date>, in the same entitled case (142 SCRA 208), 
this Court restated and clarified the rule on this point, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>“1)<span>&nbsp; </span><em>Beginning one month after the promulgation of 
this Resolution</em>, the rule shall be strictly enforced that no motion for 
extension of time to file a motion for new trial or reconsideration may be filed 
with the Metropolitan or Municipal Trial Courts, the Regional Trial Courts, and 
the Intermediate Appellate Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such <span>a </span>motion may 
be filed only in cases pending with the Supreme Court as the court of last 
resort, which may in its sound discretion either grant or deny the extension 
requested.”<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">In other words, there is <span>a </span>one-month grace period 
from the promulgation on May 30, 1986 of this Court's Resolution in the <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Habaluyas</em></span> 
case, or up to June 30, 1986, within which the rule barring extensions of time 
to file motions for new trial or reconsideration is, as yet, not strictly 
enforceable (<span class="SpellE"><em>Bayaca</em></span><em> vs. IAC</em>, G. R. 
No. 74824, September 15, 1986).</p>
<p class="BODY">Since petitioners herein filed their Motion for Extension on 
<st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1985">August 6, 1985</st1:date>, it was still 
within the grace period, which expired on <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1986">June 3<span>0</span>, 1986</st1:date>, and may still be allowed.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is granted; the Appellate Court's 
Decision of <st1:date month="1" day="8" year="1986">January 8, 1986</st1:date> 
is SET ASIDE, and this case is hereby remanded to the Regional Trial Court, 
Branch XXIII, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, which is hereby directed to grant the extension of 
time requested by petitioners for the filing of the Motion for Reconsideration, 
and to resolve the same.</p>
<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE"><strong>SO 
ORDERED</strong>.</span></p><span style="font-style: italic;"><st1:place>Yap</st1:place>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Narvasa</span>, Cruz, Feliciano, <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, <span class="GramE">JJ.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></div>
