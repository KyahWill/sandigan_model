				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a disbarment case filed in 1972 by Wilson <span class="SpellE">Jesena</span>, the president and board chairman of Lucky Homes,
Inc., against lawyer Vicente G. <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span>, on the grounds
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of gross misconduct, breach of trust
and misappropriation of corporate funds committed while <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span>
was the general manager, secretary and counsel of the company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1969, <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span> became the general
manager of Lucky Homes, Inc. which was engaged in the sale of subdivision lots
in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Balabago</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jaro</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">Iloilo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>As
general manager, he sold in 1971 for P7<span class="GramE">,140</span> to his
wife, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a
lot of the Lucky Homes, Inc. with an area of 238 square meters (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D)<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They</span> mortgaged the lot to the Government Service Insurance System
as security for a loan of P18,000 (P13,200 only according to (<span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span> also sold to his brother, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>, Jr., two lots with an area of 200 square meters
each for the total amount of P2,000 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C)<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florencio</span></span>,
Jr., mortgaged the lots to the <span class="SpellE">Oton</span> Rural Bank as
security for a loan of P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">3</span>,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">000.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>He
sold to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his friend, <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ealdama</span>, Jr., for P1<span class="GramE">,000</span> a
lot with an area of 200 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ealdama</span> mortgaged the lot to the same bank for P2<span class="GramE">,000</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the time the three sales were made the fair market value of
the lots was P35 a square meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Oñasa</u></span><u> failed to remit the proceeds of the sales
nor to make an accounting thereof to Lucky Homes, Inc. or <span class="SpellE">Jesena</span></u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sales to <span class="SpellE">Oñasa's</span>
wife and brother were the objects of court actions filed by <span class="SpellE">Jesena</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
decision dated <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1979</st1:date>
ordered (1) <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span> and his wife to pay Lucky Homes,
Inc. <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> the sum of P7<span class="GramE">,140</span>
and (2) <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span> and his brother to pay <span class="SpellE">Jesena</span> <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> P14,000 plus
P1,000 as attorney's fees in each case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Appellate Court noted that in the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
case filed against <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span> he admitted that the prices
of the lots were not paid and that <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span> "<u>simply
connived to have the lots transferred" to his wife and brother</u> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. N-1; p. 17, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G. R.
No. 51869-70, <span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span>, Jr. vs. Lucky Homes, Inc., SC
Res. of January 9, 1980 denying petition for review).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is relevant to mention that the senior documents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">examiner of</span> the National Bureau of
Investigation found <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that the supposed
"Management and Services Contract" executed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Jesena</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>That</span> finding was confirmed by the Constabulary Crime Laboratory (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K)<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span></span> produced that contract as part of
his answer and as his Exhibit 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
prepared it (11 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> </span><st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">September 6, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jesena</span> filed falsification </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span> collected P16<span class="GramE">,943.94</span>
from lot buyers Salvador <span class="SpellE">Batapa</span>, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Marabe</span>, Julian Palomar and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
impliedly admitted that he did not turn over that amount to his employer (p.
70, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Oñasa</span> contends that he should not be
disciplined for nonprofessional misconduct or for alleged irregularities in
business transactions not connected with the practice of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">his </span>legal profession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This contention is devoid of merit because
his outrageous unscrupulousness reveals that he is not a person of good moral
character.</p>

<blockquote>"As good character is an essential qualification for the
admission of an attorney to practice, he may be removed whenever he ceases to
possess such a character" (7 C.J.S. 735).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Generally, conduct of attorney <u>outside </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his professional capacity</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> which shows him to be unfit to manage the
affairs of others is a ground for his suspension or disbarment" (7 C.J.S.
762).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"So it is held that an attorney will be removed not only for
malpractice and dishonesty in his profession, but also for <u>gross misconduct
not connected with his professional duties, which shows him to be unfit for the
office and unworthy of the privileges which his license and the law confer upon
him</u>" (<u>In</u> <u>re</u> Smith, 73 Kan. 743 cited in <span class="SpellE"><u>In</u></span> <u>re</u> <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, 44
Phil. 567, 572).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Pelaez</u></span> case disciplinary
action was taken against a lawyer who pledged the shares of stock belonging to
his ward to guarantee the payment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of </span>his
personal debt.</p>

<p class="BODY">A lawyer who misappropriated money which he had received in
payment for a piece of land which he knew was not for sale was disbarred (<u>In</u>
<u>re</u> <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>, 102 Phil. 940.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>See <span class="SpellE">Arciga</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Maniwang</span>, 106 SCRA 591 re gross immoral conduct.)</p>

<p class="BODY">A lawyer is duty-bound to maintain a "reputation for
fidelity to private trust" (No. 32, Canons of Legal Ethics).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's acts prove <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that
he is </span>unworthy to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">continue as </span>a
member of the bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, he is
