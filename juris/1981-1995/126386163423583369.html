<span class="SpellE">Siton</span> and John Doe."</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts in this case as found by the lower court are
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> <span class="SpellE">Siton</span> purchased from Car Traders Philippines, Inc. a
vehicle described as Mitsubishi Celeste two-door with air-conditioning, Engine
2M-62799, Serial No. A73-2652 and paid P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as <span class="SpellE">downpayment</span> of the price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The remaining balance of P68<span class="GramE">,400.00</span>, includes
not only the remaining principal obligation but also advance interests and
premiums for motor vehicle insurance policies.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 14, 1979, <span class="SpellE">Siton</span> executed a
promissory note in favor of Car Traders Philippines, Inc. expressly stipulating
that the face value of the note which is P68,400.00, shall "be payable,
without need of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>notice of

</span>The Chattel Mortgage Contract provides additional stipulations, such
as:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a) the waiver by the mortgagor of
his rights <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">under Art. </span>1252 of
the Civil Code to designate the application of his payments and authorize the
mortgagee or its assigns to apply such payments to either his promissory or
note to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a</span>ny of his existing
obligations to the mortgagee or its assigns at the latter's discretion; and b)
concerning the insurance of the subject motor vehicle, the mortgagor is under
obligation to secure the necessary policy in an amount not less than the
outstanding balance of the mortgage obligation and that loss thereof shall be
made payable to the mortgagee or its assigns as its interest may appear, with
the further obligation of the mortgagor to deliver the policy to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">mort</span>gagee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mortgagor further agrees that in default
of his effecting or renewing the insurance and delivering the policy as
endorsed to the mortgagee within five (5) days after the execution of the
mortgage or the expiry date of the insurance, the mortgagee may, at his option
but without any obligation to do so, effect such insurance or obtain such
renewal for the account of the mortgagor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The credit covered by the promissory note and chattel mortgage
executed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> <span class="SpellE">Siton</span>
was first assigned by Car Traders Philippines, Inc, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Filinvest</span> Credit Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Filinvest</span>
Credit Corporation likewise reassigned said credit in favor of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Servicewide</span> Specialists, Inc. and respondent <span class="SpellE">Siton</span> was advised of this second assignment.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Alleging that <span class="SpellE">Siton</span> failed to pay the

either case, for defendants to pay certain sum of money for attorney's fees,

</span>He also manifested that the Answer he has filed in his behalf should
likewise serve <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>a responsive

<p class="BODY">In its first assigned error, petitioner alleges that the sale of
the mortgaged vehicle between the mortgagor <span class="SpellE">Siton</span> and
De <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span> was void, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">as </span>the sale is prohibited under the provisions of the Deed of
Chattel Mortgage, the Chattel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Mortgage </span>Act
(Act 1508) and the Revised Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Deed of Chattel Mortgage executed by the petitioner and Siton

of the mortgaged property in favor of a third person, therefore, affects not
the validity of the sale but only the penal liability of the mortgagor under
the Revised Penal Code and the binding effect of such sale on the mortgagee
under the Deed of chattel Mortgage.</p>

the deed of sale made by <span class="SpellE">Siton</span> in favor of De <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span>, as neither petitioner nor its predecessor has given

Mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On this matter, the
appellate court upheld the findings of the trial court, as follows, to </span>wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The first issue is whether or not the sale and transfer of
the motor vehicle, subject matter of the chattel mortgage, made by <span class="SpellE">Siton</span> in favor of Atty. de <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span>
is illegal and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Chattel Mortgage Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The supposition is that if it were illegal, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">then plaintiff has all the right to file this
</span>action and to foreclose on the chattel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both defendants
testified that, before the projected sale, they went to a </span>certain Atty.
Villa of <span class="SpellE">Filinvest</span> Credit Corporation advising the
latter of the intended sale and transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:

that the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">verbal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">information given
to the corporation would suffice, and that it would be tedious and impractical
to effect a change of transfer of ownership as that would require a new credit
investigation as to the capacity and worthiness of Atty. De <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span>,
being the new debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The further
suggestion given by Atty. Villa is that the account should be maintained in the
name of <span class="SpellE">Galicano</span> <span class="SpellE">Siton</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff claims that it and its predecessor
had never been notified of </span>the sale, much <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">writing as required by the
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this particular issue, it
would really appear </span>that, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">since
the transfer, it was Atty. de <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span> who had been paying
said account, almost invariably with his personal checks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">fact, one of the checks that supposedly bounced, marked Exhibit J and
the relative receipt </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Exhibit 16, was Atty. de <span class="SpellE">Dumo's</span>
personal check.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that plaintiff has
been accepting such payments by defendant de <span class="SpellE">D<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">u</span>mo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would appear, therefore, that there was an
implied acceptance by the plaintiff and its predecessor of the transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another reasonable conclusion is that, while
there was failure on the part of defendants to comply strictly and literall</span>y<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> with their contract, there was substantial
compliance therewith." (pp. 92-93, </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">)<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

which were affirmed on appeal by the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The conclusions and findings of facts by the
