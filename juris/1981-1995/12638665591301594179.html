Bank (pp. 28-32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DRBSLA director, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
V. Odra, found serious irregularities in its lending and deposit operations,
including false entries and false statements in the bank’s records to give it
the appearance of solidity and soundness which it did not possess (p. 28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result
of its questionable transactions, the bank <span style="">became <span style="">insolvent.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In

Director Odra, as receiver, took possession and <span style="">control of the </span>assets and records of the rural bank (p. 39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

dismiss the liquidation proceeding (Sp. Proc. No. 111) on the ground that the
Central Bank gravely abused its discretion in ordering the liquidation of said
rural Bank.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Central Bank, through its house counsel, filed a motion for extension of
time to file its responsive pleading in Civil Case No. 1309 (Annex G, p. 42, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January
12, 1982, the Solicitor General entered his appearance in the case as counsel
for the Central Bank, and asked for a second extension of time to file a
responsive pleading (Annex I, p. 42, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 15, 1982, respondent Judge issued the questioned order
in Civil Case No. 1309, restraining the respondent Central Bank from “closing

restore the control and management of the bank to its Board of Directors; and
to desist from liquidating its assets until ordered otherwise by this Court”
(p. 42, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On January 29, 1982, respondent Judge modified this order by requiring
the parties in Civil Case No. 1309 to “refrain from any act or acts which will
tend to disturb the state in which the parties were found before the complaint
was filed” (p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1982</st1:date>,
he filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. 1309 on<span style=""> </span>the ground that respondent Judge had no jurisdiction over a
special civil action for prohibition, <i>mandamus</i> and injunction against
the Central Bank and that the petition was defective in form because it was not
properly verified (Annex L, p. 43, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="3">March

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1982</st1:date>,
Judge De la Cruz declared the CB, et <span style="">al.
in </span>default for failure to file a responsive pleading to the petition in <span style="">Civil </span>Case No. 1309.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pointed out that “the projected move to
bring the court’s denial of the motion to dismiss to the Supreme Court on <i>certiorari</i>
did not stop the period given to the respondents to answer” (Annex D, p. 72, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
