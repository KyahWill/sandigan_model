				<H3>ADOLFO OLAES AND LINDA M. CRUZ, PETITIONERS,
VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND HON. JUDGE ALICIA L. SANTOS (IN HER CAPACITY AS PRESIDING
JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF OLONGAPO CITY, BRANCH 73), RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction, the petitioners challenge the admission by the
respondent judge of evidence seized by virtue of an allegedly invalid search
warrant and of an <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">extrajudicial </span>confession
taken from them without according them the right to assistance of counsel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
They seek to restrain further proceedings in the criminal case against them for
violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act (which we have suspended)<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and ask that they be acquitted with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the
setting aside of the questioned orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his Comment, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">suggests </span>that the petition should be dismissed as it is not
alleged there­in that the respondent judge has committed grave abuse of
discretion or acted without or in excess of <span class="GramE">jurisdiction</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He adds that if any reversible error has been
committed, it may be corrected not in this petition but in an ordinary appeal,
which may not even be necessary if the petitioners are exonerated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners, in their Reply, do not meet these arguments
head-on, thus impliedly admitting the formal defect in their petition, but
submit that technicalities should yield to substantial questions in the
interest of justice and to avoid unnecessary or protracted litigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their contention is that since there are
important consti­tutional issues involved, these questions should be decided in
this petition instead of having them debated and resolved first in the lower
court in accordance with the usual procedure, to the prejudice of the speedy
disposition of their case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not usually persuaded by this kind of argu­ment, since
procedural rules are intended precisely to insure an orderly administration of
justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rights are best established in
accordance with the procedure laid down by the adjective law, which is as
binding on the parties <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the
substantive law since they are supposed to comple­ment each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General is obviously <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">correct in faulting the petition and in
contending that, besides being defective, it is not the proper remedy at this
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no disputing this stand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Worthy of note in this
connection is the separate opinion of the present Chief Justice in Joseph v.
Villaluz,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> where he declared that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"... the Court adheres to the settled rule that it will not
overrule in a special civil action the trial court's interlocutory order denying
a motion to dismiss for failure or insufficiency of the prosecution's evi­dence
since it cannot review in such special civil action the prosecution's evidence
and decide here and now in advance that it has or has not established beyond
reasonable doubt the guilt of the petitioners-accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The orderly procedure prescribed by the Rules
of Court is for the accused to present their evidence after which the trial
court will on the basis of the evidence presented before it by both the
prosecution and the defense render its judgment of conviction or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">acquittal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the verdict be one of acquittal, the case ends there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it be a verdict of conviction, then appeal
is the proper remedy - and such appeal in order to have a review of the trial
court's findings of fact lies within the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of
the Court of Appeals."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We reiterate the rule
here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Even so, the Court has
decided, without detracting from the validity of the above-cited observations,
to deviate from the established procedure on this matter and to categorically
resolve the issues presented in the case before us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The challenged orders are, indeed,
interlocutory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, a
restatement of the principles governing such issues will, it is expected,
simplify the proceedings in the court below and speed up the disposition of the
criminal case against the petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners claim that the search warrant issued by the
respondent judge is unconstitutional because it does not indicate the specific
offense they are supposed to have committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is, </span>therefore,
according to them, no valid finding of probable cause as a justification for
the issuance of the said warrant in conformity with the Bill of Rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of this argument, they cite
Stonehill v. Diokno,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where Chief Justice Concepcion struck down the search warrants issued therein
for being based on the general allegation that the petitioners had committed
violations of "Central Bank Laws, Tariff and Customs Laws, Internal
Revenue Code and Revised Penal Code." He declared:</p>

<blockquote>"In other words, no <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">specific</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>offense had been alleged in said
applications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The averments thereof with
respect to the offense committed were <u>abstract</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, it was <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">impossible</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> </span>for the judges who issued the warrants to have found the
existence of probable cause, for the same presupposes the introduction of
competent proof that the party against whom it is sought has performed <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">particular</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> </span>acts, or committed <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">specific</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> omissions</span>, violating <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>given
provision of our criminal law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have examined the search warrant issued in the instant case
and find it does not come under the strictures of the Stonehill doctrine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case cited, there was a bare reference
to the laws in general, without any specifi­cation of the particular sections thereof
that were alleged to have been violated out of the hundreds of prohibitions
contained in such codifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no similar ambiguity in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the caption of the search warrant states
that it is in connection with "Violation of RA 6425, otherwise known as
the Dangerous Drugs Acts of 1972," it is clearly recited in the text
thereof that "there is probable cause to believe that Adolfo Olaes alias
'Debie' and alias 'Baby' of No. 628 Comia St., Filtration, Sta. Rita, Olongapo
City, has in their possession and control and custody of marijuana dried
stalks/leaves/seeds/cigarettes and other regulated/prohibited and exempt
narcotics preparations which is the subject of the offense stated above."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Although the specific section of the Dangerous Drugs Act is not pinpointed,
there is no question at all of the specific offense alleged to have been
committed as a basis for the finding of probable cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The search warrant also satisfies the
requirement in the Bill of Rights of the particularity of the description to be
made of the "place to be searched and the persons or things to be
seized."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also fault the admission of the extrajudicial
confessions which they had given without the assistance or advice of counsel
and cite Section 20 of the Bill of Rights of the 1973 Constitution providing
that "any confession obtained in violation of this section shall be
inadmissible in evidence."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the separate sworn statements taken from Adolfo Olaes and
Linda Cruz on <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1982</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>it appears that both petitioners
were, before being examined, specifically informed of their right to the
assistance of counsel, which would be provided them by the investigating office
at their request.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asked if they
understood, they said "Opo" and affixed their signatures opposite
their answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by a
statement entitled "Pagpapatunay" or Verification in which they said <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">inter</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt"> </span><u>alia</u> that they did not need the assistance of counsel
("Hindi ko na kailangan ang tulong ng isang manananggol.") which they
also signed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only after these
prelimi­nary precautions had been taken that the interrogation began and was
recorded in the sworn statement later introduced against them at their trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no claim that any force, violence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">intimi</span>dation or threat or any means
vitiating the free will was employed against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their only objection to the extra­judicial
confessions is that they were obtained without the assistance of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They do not aver in their petition that they
were not apprised of their right to counsel or that they were denied the
assistance of counsel when they asked for it, or, indeed, that they had asked
for it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even so, their investigation did not conform to the requirements
laid down in People v. Galit,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>where we declared:</p>

<blockquote>"At the time a person is arrested, it shall be the duty of the
arresting officer to inform him of the reason for the arrest and he must be
shown the warrant of arrest, if any.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall
be informed of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to counsel, and
that any statement he might make could be used against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The person arrested shall have the right to
communicate with his lawyer, a relative, or anyone he chooses by the most
expedient means - by telephone if possible - or by letter or messenger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It shall be the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">res</span>ponsibility of the arresting <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">officer </span>to see to it that this is accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No custodial investigation shall be conducted
unless it <span class="GramE">be</span> in the presence of counsel engaged by the
person arrested, by any person on his behalf, or appointed by the court upon
petition either of the detainee himself or by anyone on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">his </span>behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right to
counsel may be waived but the waiver shall not be valid unless made with the
assistance of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any statement
obtained in violation of the procedure herein laid down, whether exculpatory or
inculpatory, in whole or in part, shall be inadmissible in evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These requirements were made even stricter under Article III,
Section 12 of the 1987 Constitution, providing <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 12.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) Any person under inves­tigation for the
commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to
remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his
own choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the person cannot afford
the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These rights cannot be waived except in
writing and in the presence of counsel."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">"(3) </span>Any
confession or admission obtained in violation of this or Section 17 hereof
shall be inadmissible in evidence against him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above rules, we reach the conclusion that the
extrajudicial confessions should be declared inadmissible as evidence against
the herein petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is partly granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The extrajudicial confessions are excluded
but the articles seized under the challenged search warrant may be admitted in
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our temporary restraining
order of <st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1987</st1:date>, is
lifted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
