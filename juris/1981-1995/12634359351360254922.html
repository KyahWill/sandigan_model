filed on 16 October 1986 with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Valenzuela,
Metro Manila, allegedly committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“that on or about the 12th day of  October, 1986, in the municipality of Valenzuela, Metro Manila,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, with intent to kill Pacita Labos, Manuel Labos, Lina
Labos-Mojica, Edwin Labos and Ma. Cristina Labos, conspiring and confederating
together and mutually helping one another, did then and there wilfully,
unlawfully and feloniously, with evident premeditation, abuse of superior
strength and treachery, attack, assault and shoot with a .45 caliber [pistol]
and shotgun they were then provided the said Pacita Labos.  Manuel Labos, Lina Labos-Mojica, Edwin Labos
and Maria Cristina Labos, hitting them on their body, thereby causing them
serious physical injuries which directly caused the death of Pacita Labos and
Manuel Labos; thereby, also, with respect to Lina Labos-­Mojica, Edwin Labos
and Maria Cristina Labos, performing all the acts of execution which ordinarily
would have produced the crime of murder but which nevertheless did not produce
it by reason of a cause independent of their will, that is, the timely and able
medical attendance rendered to said Lina Labos-Mojica, Edwin Labos and Maria
Cristina Labos which prevented their death."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The case was docketed as Criminal Case
No. 7792-V-6 before Branch 172 of the said court.  Upon arraignment, both accused entered a plea not guilty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>  In due course, the trial on the merits
proceeded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The witnesses presented by the prosecution were Edwin Labos, Lina
Labos, Sgt. Ponciano Casile, Dr. Rodolfo Lizondra, Dr. Tahil Mindalano and Dr.
Leo Arthur Camagay.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the witnesses presented by the defense were accused Santos
Ducay and Edgardo Ducay, Ruben Ampuan, Mario Abad and Cristino Mariano.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Lina Labos testified that at about 5:00
o'clock in the morning of 12 October 1986, she was sleeping in the sala at the
second floor of the house together with her husband, Manuel Labos, and their
six-month old daughter, Ma. Cristina Labos, when she was awakened by the
pounding of the door on the first floor leading to the sala.  Moments later, Santos Ducay and his son,
Edgardo Ducay, appeared in the sala.  Santos was carrying a long firearm while Edgardo held a caliber .45
pistol.  The two started firing at
Manuel, who was already standing albeit half asleep.  Then they shot her mother-in-law, Pacita Labos.  Both Manuel and Pacita were killed.  The accused also shot her, Ma. Cristina, and
Edwin Labos, her brother-in-law, who was then coming out of the bedroom.  She was hit in the stomach and gall bladder
while Ma. Cristina was hit in the right leg, left thigh and abdomen.  The accused then turned their backs and one
of them uttered <i>"Ubos ang lahi." </i>She was able to identify the
two accused, who are her former neighbors, because of the fluorescent light in
the sala.  After the accused had left,
the police came and brought the wounded to the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical
Center.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Edwin Labos testified that on 24 December 1985 his brother Manuel
Labos and Santos Ducay quarreled and stabbed each other; however, Santos Ducay
did not file any charges against Manuel who gave the former P200.00 for medical
expenses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
He also corroborated the testimony of his sister-in-law.  He heard the banging of the door and several
gunshots, then he went out of his room and saw his brother Manuel already
sprawled dead on the floor.  He saw both
accused shoot his sister-in-law and his niece.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Edgardo then fired at him, hitting him in the right thigh, while Santos shot
his mother.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
He was later treated at the Jose Reyes Memorial Medical Center where he spent
P13,299.53 (Exhibits "Q" to "Q-165").  They paid P13,200.00 to Popular Memorial
Chapels and P9,060.00 to Holy Cross Memorial Chapel for the interment of his
mother and brother.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. Ponciano Casile, a police investigator of the Valenzuela
Police Station, testified that he was ordered to investigate the incident.  In the course of his investigation, he
learned that the assailants were Santos Ducay and a yet unidentified man who,
upon Lina Ducay's sworn statement given two days later, was identified as
Santos Ducay's son, Edgardo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Rodolfo Lizondra, Supervising Medico-Legal Officer of the
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), testified on the post-mortem
examinations he conducted on the cadavers of Pacita and Manuel Labos, the
results of which are embodied in two autopsy reports (Exhibits "K"
and "M").<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
He determined the cause of death of Pacita as "hemorrhage, secondary to
shotgun wounds of the chest, abdomen and left arm," and that of Manuel as
"hemorrhage, secondary to gunshot wounds of the head and chest." Dr.
Tahil Mindalano testified regarding the injuries sustained by Lina and Ma.
Cristina Labos and the medical assistance rendered to them,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
while Dr. Arthur Leo Macasiano Camagay testified about the injuries sustained
by Edwin Labos.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Drs. Mindalano and Camagay declared that without the medical attendance given
to Lina, Ma. Cristina and Edwin Labos, said persons would have died because of
the nature of the injuries sustained by them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Per the Medico-Legal Certificates issued, Lina Labos sustained
three gunshot wounds on her "left umbilical," "left
buttocks," and "lateral D/3rd left thigh." The point of exit of
the last wound was at the "anterior middle 3rd left thigh," thereby "penetrating
the liver by 1.5 cm. thru and thru, perforating the duodenum by 1 cm. thru and
thru, perforating jejunom by 0.5 cm. lacerating the pancreas by 2 cm.
transecting muscular branch aorta (abdominal)" (Exhibit "A").  Edwin Labos sustained a gunshot wound at the
"middle 3rd anterior surface thigh, right" with no point of exit
resulting in "Gustilo­-Anderson type III open fracture comminuted M/3rd
femur, right," (Exhibit "V") and Ma. Cristina Labos sustained
three gunshot wounds located at "lateral aspect D/3rd thigh right,"
"antero-­medial aspect M/3rd thigh, left" and "periumbilcal
right" (Exhibit "B").</p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused testified that they were in their house at Area 4,
Valenzuela at the time of the incident in question.  At about 6:00 o'clock in the morning, they were roused from their
sleep by a friend, Martin Gabukan, who informed them that Santos was a suspect
in the shooting of the Labos family.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Gabukan told Santos not to worry because "many people heard that (the
accused) were really not the one."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Santos was arrested on 14 October 1986 in Balagtas, Bulacan<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
while he was looking for a lawyer, while Edgardo was taken into custody by the
police while he was attending to his father in the police headquarters.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Cristino Mariano, a neighbor of the Ducays, testified that at
about 6:00 o'clock in the morning of 12 October 1986, Santos Ducay came and
said that he (Santos) was a suspect in the shooting incident in question.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The following day, he brought Santos to the Barangay Captain, Pio Angeles, who
entered in the barangay blotter (Exhibit "6") Santos’ profession of
innocence of the crime he was suspected of.  On cross-examination, Cristino stated that the distance between Area 4,
where he and the Ducays are residing, and the house of the Laboses at Area 6 (also
referred to as Area 11) is about one kilometer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Ruben Ampuan, a neighbor of the Laboses, testified that at the
time of the incident and while he was still lying down, he heard gunshots.  He stood up, opened the window and saw two
men leaving the house of the Laboses.  He stated that they were not the accused in this case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Mario Abad Allegado testified that he was at the <i>"tambakan"
w</i>hich is about thirty meters from the scene of the crime when he heard
several gunshots.  As he headed for
home, he met two persons in front of the lamp post near the house of the
Eugenios heading towards Maysan Road.  One of them, a tall, thin fellow, with curly hair and mestizo features,
was carrying a firearm, while the other, whose face he did not see,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
was shorter.  He believed that both
persons were the assailants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
He declared that they were not the accused whom he knows very well being his
former neighbors.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon reaching home, he heard a commotion from the house of the Laboses.  He went inside the Laboses' house and saw
the wounded family members.  He asked
Edwin and Lina Labos whether they recognized their assailants and both answered
that they did not.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Capt. Carlos Tiquia, Chief Investigator of the Valenzuela Police
Station, who was presented as the only defense witness during the hearing for
the application for bail and whose testimony was adopted in the trial on the
merits, declared that he proceeded to the crime scene after receiving a report
on the incident from the investigator assigned to the case.  When he and the investigator returned to the
office, his investigator took down the statements of the witnesses, one of whom
was Erwin Labos and whose statement was taken down at 4:00 o'clock in the
morning of 14 October 1986.  However, he
believed that Erwin was not telling the truth so that he personally talked to
him, and at 6:00 am., Erwin executed a supplemental statement (Exhibit
"4") in the presence of several people including his brother Renato
Labos.  This time, Erwin described one
of the alleged assailants as tall, with curly hair and mestizo features.  On the basis of such a description, Tiquia
made a request for a cartographic sketch to the PC Crime Laboratory.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 April 1988, the trial court promulgated its judgment
finding Santos Ducay guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged but
acquitting Edgardo Ducay on ground of reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The dispositive portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the Court finds guilty beyond
reasonable doubt Santos Ducay of the complex crime of double murder and
multiple frustrated murder as charged.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The penalty of reclusion temporal in its maximum period to death is
equivalent to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day to death, the minimum being 17
years, 4 months and 1 day to 20 years, the medium being reclusion perpetua and
maximum, death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court could have meted the death sentence on Santos Ducay but
is prevented from doing so by the New Constitution.  Santos Ducay is, therefore, hereby sentenced to suffer
imprisonment for life, reclusion perpetua which is the medium period of the
penalty provided by law, and all the accessory penalties provided by law, to
indemnify the heirs of the victim Pacita Labos in the sum of P30,000.00 and the
heirs of Manuel Labos P30,000.00; to indemnify the victims Edwin Labos in the
sum of P13,299.53 as reimbursement of medical expenses, and the sum of
P4,500.00 as lost earnings for the period from October 12, 1986 to July 1987;
to indemnify Lina Labos and Ma. Cristina Labos in the total sum of P10,000.00
as reimbursement of medical expenses; and to pay the costs of suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court finds Edgardo Ducay not guilty of the crime charged on
ground of reasonable doubt and is hereby acquitted.  The Jail Warden of Valenzuela, Metro Manila, is hereby ordered to
release Edgardo Ducay from detention unless held for any other lawful cause.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In convicting Santos Ducay, the trial
court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court never doubts the participation of Santos Ducay not
only on the basis of the positive identification made by surviving victims,
Lina and Edwin Labos, the motive Santos Ducay had to avenge the assault done on
him by Manuel Labos, but also because his positive identification sweeps aside
altogether his defense -- that of alibi -- ­a very weak defense in the light of
the overwhelming evidence against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the evidence thus adduced the Court is convinced beyond
reasonable doubt that it was Santos Ducay who was one of the persons who
conspired with another in killing the victims, Manuel Labos, Pacita Labos, and
in trying to kill Lina Labos, Maria Cristina Labos and Edwin Labos, but was
frustrated, The evidence of evident premeditation, abuse of superior strength
and treachery, were clearly shown by the prosecution when it proved
convincingly to the Court that considering the time of the attack, 5:00 at
dawn, evident premeditation is clear especially if the testimony of Edwin Labos
will be considered that months previous to this attack, Santos Ducay had a
quarrel with one of the victims shot to death.  There was abuse of superior strength and treachery because the victims
were asleep at the time of the attack and were therefore unprepared and unarmed
for the attack.  They had no chance
whatsoever to fight back, the six months baby Ma. Cristina Labos
especially."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court expressed the view that two murders and three
frustrated murders were committed, or that there are as many crimes as there
are victims in this case because "the trigger of the gun used in
committing the acts complained of was pressed in several instances and not in
one single act." However, it did not impose the corresponding penalties
therefor "because the information to which the accused pleaded is only one
crime of double murder and multiple frustrated murder."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 May 1988, Santos Ducay filed a Partial Motion For
Reconsideration And/Or New Trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
He sought the admission of the alleged result of a paraffin test conducted on
him on 13 October 1986, or a day after the incident, which shows that he was
found negative for powder burns.  For
lack of merit, the trial court denied the motion in its Order of 24 May 1988.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Santos Ducay, hereinafter referred to as the Appellant, then
filed on 7 June 1988 a Notice of Appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his "Brief for the Defense" filed on 24 September
1992,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
the appellant raises the following assignment of errors:</p>

<blockquote>"1.
THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING AS 'POSITIVE' PROSECUTION WITNESSES EDWIN
LABOS AND LINA LABOS' IDENTIFICATION OF ACCUSED; HENCE, IT ERRED WHEN IT
REJECTED ACCUSED'S DEFENSE OF ALIBI.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  2. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DENYING ACCUSED'S
PARTIAL MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND/OR NEW TRIAL FOR THE ADMISSION OF THE
PARAFFIN EXAMINATION ON ACCUSED A DAY AFTER THE INCIDENT FINDING HIM NEGATIVE
OF POWER (sic) BURNS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  3.  THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the first assigned error, the appellant attacks the
credibility of prosecution witnesses Lina and Edwin Labos and alleges that
their identification of the appellant is vague and highly dubious.  To buttress this claim, he refers this Court
to his testimony that a neighbor by the name of Martin Gabukan told him that
while the victims were in the hospital, he (Martin) overheard Edwin Labos say
that he did not really see the appellant and Edgardo Ducay; that Edwin only
happened to mention the name of the appellant when he was asked by the police
about their enemies in their place.  The
appellant then concludes that the crime was imputed upon him not because he was
seen at the scene of the crime but because of the motive alleged, namely, that
he and Manuel Labos had an altercation on 24 December 1985.  As to Lina Labos, the appellant maintains
that she gave her statement only on 14 October 1986 or two days after the
occurrence of the incident; she thus had sufficient time to concoct a story and
implicate the appellant and Edgardo after she had talked with her
brother-in-law, Edwin, and her father-in-law, Jesus Labos.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further claims that since the trial court did not
believe Lina and Edwin's testimonies that they positively identified Edgardo
Ducay, then following the maxim "<i>falsus et (sic) uno, falsus et (sic)
omnibus,</i>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
it should not have also believed their testimony as regards the appellant.  He also faults the trial court for rejecting
the supplementary statement (Exhibit "4") of Erwin Labos, brother of
Edwin Labos, and Erwin's "contemporaneous" statement to Edgardo
Ducay:  <i>"Kuya pasensiya ka na,
naturo kita noon una, hindi naman ikaw," </i>allegedly absolving the
accused and pointing to a tall, mestizo and curly-haired man as one of the
assailants, which statement was allegedly confirmed by Sgt. Casile and Capt.
Tiquia and made as the basis of the cartographic sketch by the PC Crime
Laboratory.  According to the appellant,
these declarations of Erwin are declarations against interest and are part of
the <i>res gestae</i>.  Finally, the
appellant asserts that the evidence for the prosecution is weak because no
disinterested witness was presented despite the fact that the incident occurred
in a thickly populated area.  He also
contends that the prosecution suppressed evidence by failing to present Erwin
Labos as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">These claims are without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful evaluation of the records and the evidence adduced by
the prosecution discloses that the appellant had been positively identified by
Lina and Edwin Labos.  In his sworn
statement (Exhibit "H") executed barely four hours after the incident
and while he was still in the emergency room of the hospital, Edwin explicitly
declared that the appellant was one of the assailants.  This sworn statement was spontaneously given
at the time he was hovering between life and death.  He had no opportunity then to contrive or fabricate a story.  The appellant is the only one identified
therein by Edwin.  Thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">Lina Labos also identified the appellant as one of the

That her statement was executed two days after the incident does not perforce
affect her credibility.  With the three
gunshot wounds she sustained and the thought of the death of her husband and
mother-in-law and the serious injuries of her daughter and brother-in-law, it
would be too much to expect from her that physical and emotional fortitude to
forthwith give her statement as what Edwin did.  Delay or vacillation in making a criminal accusation does not
necessarily impair the credibility of a witness if such delay is satisfactorily
explained.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
In any case, the speculation that she could have contrived her testimony after
having talked with her father-in-law and brother-in-law is wholly unsupported
by evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellee that the alleged statements made by
Martin Gabukan to the appellant, which the latter related in court, is hearsay
and has little, if any, probative value.  Counsel for the appellant knew, or ought to have known, that this was
so.  Yet, the defense did not present
Martin as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can we subscribe to the proposition that since the trial
court did not give credit to Edwin and Lina's testimonies that they positively
identified Edgardo, it should, pursuant to the maxim "<i>falsus in uno,
falsus in omnibus,</i>" likewise disregard their testimonies as against
the appellant and accordingly acquit him.  In <i>People vs. Dasig,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court stated that the maxim is not a mandatory rule of evidence, but
rather a permissible inference that the court may or may not draw.  In <i>People vs. Pacada</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
we stated that the testimony of a witness can be believed as to some facts and
disbelieved as to others.  And in <i>People

we ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>“It is perfectly reasonable to believe the testimony of a witness
with respect to some facts and disbelieve it with respect to other facts.  And it has been aptly said that even when
witnesses are found to have deliberately falsified in some material
particulars, it is not required that the whole of their uncorroborated
testimony be rejected but such portions thereof deemed worthy of belief may be
credited.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The primordial consideration is that the witness was present at the
scene of the crime and that he positively identified (the accused) as one of
the perpetrators of the crime charged x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Professor Wigmore gives the<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>following
enlightening commentary:</p>

<blockquote>"It may be said, once for all, that the maxim is in itself
worthless; -- first, in point of validity, because in one form it merely
contains in loose fashion a kernel of truth which no one needs to be told, and
in the others it is absolutely false as a maxim of life; and secondly, in point
of utility, because it merely tells the jury what they may do in any event, not
what they must do or must not do, and therefore it is a superfluous form of
words.  It is also in practice pernicious,
first, because there is frequently a misunderstanding of its proper force, and
secondly, because it has become in the hands of many counsel a mere instrument
for obtaining new trials upon points wholly unimportant in themselves.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not err in rejecting the supplementary
statement (Exhibit "4") of Erwin Labos, brother of Edwin Labos, and
his alleged contemporaneous statement to Edgardo Ducay.  Erwin Labos was not called by the defense as
its witness -- even as a hostile one.  Whatever declaration he made to any party, either written or oral, is
thus hearsay.  The prosecution
seasonably objected to the admission of Exhibit "4."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, as noted by the prosecution, this document is not under oath while his
first statement implicating the appellant is duly subscribed and sworn to.  The defense should have presented Erwin as a
witness if indeed it was convinced that Exhibit "4" expresses the
truth.  There is no showing that this
could not have been done because Erwin was not available.  His brother, Edwin, testified that Erwin was
staying with his father in Escolta.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
This information should have been utilized by the defense to have compulsory
process issued to bring Erwin to court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead, the defense imputes suppression of evidence upon the
prosecution in not presenting Erwin Labos as its witness.  It is settled that suppression of evidence
is inapplicable in a case where the evidence is at the disposal of both the
prosecution and the defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the prosecution had no cogent reason for presenting Erwin since there
is no showing that he was in the house when the incident occurred.  On the other hand, the defense needed his
testimony for if, indeed, he should affirm his supplemental statement, he may
somehow enhance the theory of the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not likewise agree with the appellant that Erwin's alleged
statement to Edgardo Ducay:  <i>"Kuya
pasensiya ka na, naturo kita noon una, hindi naman ikaw," </i>uttered
immediately after he made his supplemental statement, is a part of the <i>res
gestae </i>and thus an exception to the hearsay rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule on spontaneous statements as part of the <i>res gestae </i>is
stated in Section 42, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court:  "statements made by a person while a startling occurrence is
taking place or immediately prior or subsequent thereto with respect to the
circumstances thereof, may be given in evidence as part of the <i>res gestae</i>.  x x x." There are three requisites for
the admission of spontaneous statements as evidence of the <i>res gestae</i>:  1) that the principal act, the <i>res
gestae, </i>be a startling occurrence; 2) that the statements were made before
the declarant had time to contrive or devise; and 3) that the statements must
concern the occurrence in question and its immediately attending circumstances.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
The rationale for the exception lies in the fact that a statement made under
the stress of an exciting event or condition tends to ensure that the statement
is spontaneous and, therefore, trustworthy; and the likely proximity in time between
the event or condition and the statement minimizes the possibility of a memory
problem.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn48" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
Erwin's alleged statement to Edgardo Ducay does not refer to the incident in
question but rather to his prior statement (not the supplemental statement)
implicating Edgardo Ducay.  Furthermore,
the alleged "contemporaneous" statement was made two days after the
shooting incident.  In no way can it be
said that Erwin was under the stress of an exciting event or condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor do we find merit in the appellant's argument that the
prosecution's evidence is weak because unlike the defense, it did not present
any disinterested witness.  He suggests
that since the place where the incident happened is thickly populated, there
were many people who saw the gunmen and who could have pointed to the accused
if they were the ones who committed the crime considering that they were
familiar to the residents of the area.  In the first place, it was not shown that at the time the incident occurred,
many people were already awake and were able to see the gunmen.  In the second place, assuming that it was so
shown, the determination of who should be utilized as witnesses by the
prosecution is addressed to the sound discretion of the prosecutor handling the
case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn49" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
That the prosecutor did not present any disinterested witness does not lessen
the strength of the prosecution's case, which is anchored on the testimonies of
Edwin and Lina Labos, who were themselves eyewitnesses and victims of the
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the ultimate analysis, the first assigned error involves the
credibility of witnesses.  It is settled
that when the issue is one of credibility of witnesses, appellate courts will
generally not disturb the findings of the trial court considering that the
latter is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the
witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying
during the trial unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance
that, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn50" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
We find no reason to depart from this rule in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his second assigned error, the appellant faults the trial
court for denying his motion for new trial on the ground of newly discovered
evidence consisting of Chemistry Report No. 0-1630-86 of the PC Crime Laboratory
Service, the result of the paraffin test conducted on Santos Ducay on 13
October 1986 or the day after the incident in question, which allegedly shows
that "both hands of the [appellant] gave NEGATIVE result to the test for
gunpowder residue (nitrates)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn51" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One of the grounds for a new trial mentioned in Section 2, Rule
121 of the Rules of Court is the discovery of new and material evidence.  The requisites therefor which must concur
are:  (1) that the evidence was
discovered after the trial; (2) that such evidence could not have been
discovered and produced at the trial even with the exercise of reasonable
diligence; and (3) that such evidence is material, not merely cumulative,
corroborative or impeaching, and is of such weight that, if admitted, it will
probably change the judgment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn52" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, the appellant was subjected to a paraffin test the day
after the crime was committed.  Certainly, he knew that the findings of such test would be
forthcoming.  He should have asked for
the result of the test to find out if it is exculpatory, in which case he could
have presented it during the hearing of his application for bail or, at the
latest, during the trial on the merits.  In any event, the chemistry report cannot be considered as newly discovered
evidence since it was already existing even before the trial commenced and
could have been easily produced in court by compulsory process.  The appellant either did not exercise
reasonable diligence for its production or simply forgot about it.  Forgotten evidence is, of course, not a
ground for a new trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn53" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the result of the paraffin test conducted on the appellant is not
conclusive evidence that he did not fire a gun.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn54" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
It is possible for a person to fire a gun and yet be negative for the presence
of nitrates, as when he wore gloves or washed his hands afterwards.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn55" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court, therefore, correctly denied the motion for new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the witnesses and the nature of the wounds
suffered by the victims show that there were two different firearms used by two
assailants, one of whom is the appellant.  The crimes committed were not caused by a single act nor were any of the
crimes committed as a necessary means of committing the others.  In this case, there are as many crimes committed
as there are victims.  The trial court
correctly ruled that there was no complex crime "considering that the
trigger of the gun used in committing the acts complained of was pressed in
several instances and not in one single act." It is settled that when
various victims expire from separate shots, such acts constitute separate and
distinct crimes.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn56" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
However, the trial court erred when it ruled that "(i)t cannot, however,
impose the corresponding penalty for the crime committed against each victim because
the information to which the accused pleaded is only one crime of double murder
and multiple frustrated murder." The information in this case, although
denominated as one for a complex crime, clearly charges the accused with five
different criminal acts.  It
states:  "the above-named accused,
with intent <u>to</u> <u>kill</u> Pacita Labos, Manuel Labos, Lina
Labos-Mojica, Edwin Labos, and Ma. Cristina Labos, x x x did then and there x x
x attack, assault and shoot with a .45 caliber [pistol] and shotgun they were then
provided the said Pacita Labos, Manuel Labos, Lina Labos-Mojica, Edwin Labos
and Ma. Cristina Labos, x x x." The appellant and his co-accused did not
move to quash the information on the ground of multiplicity of charges.  At no other time thereafter did they object
thereto.  They therefore waived such
defect<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn57" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
and the trial court thus validly rendered judgment against them for as many
crimes as were alleged and proven.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn58" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The crimes committed by the appellant and his companion, which
were proven beyond reasonable doubt are:  (1) two counts of murder with the qualifying circumstance of treachery
since the attack on the victims was so sudden and at a time when the victims
were barely awake, thus giving them no chance whatsoever to defend themselves;
and (2) three counts of frustrated murder.  Conspiracy<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn59" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a>
between the assailants was duly proven.  Together they came to the house of the victims, simultaneously attacked
them, and then, together again, they fled.  Before fleeing, one of them even exclaimed "<i>Ubos ang lahi</i>."
These acts sufficiently established a common plan or design to commit the
crimes charged and a concerted action to effectively pursue it.  Hence, the act of one is the act of all.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn60" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not, however, agree with the trial court that evident
premeditation was sufficiently established.  Although Manuel Labos stabbed the appellant on 24 December 1985, there
is paucity of evidence as to when the latter determined to kill the former and
any member of his family and as to acts manifestly indicating that he has clung
to his determination.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn61" href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, the aggravating circumstance of dwelling which was proved without
objection from the defense should be appreciated against the appellant since
the victims were attacked and shot inside their own dwelling.  The assailants displayed greater perversity
in their deliberate invasion of the home of the Laboses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn62" href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup></span></span></a></p>
