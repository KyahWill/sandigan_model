Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Antique 
sentencing accused Arthur Mendoza to the principal penalty of reclusion 
perpetua, and to indemnify the victim, Henrietta Maguad, in the sum of 
P12,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, 
together with the accessory penalties prescribed by law, for the crime 
of rape, committed according to the evidence of the prosecution, and 
quoting from the People's brief, as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Complainant Henrietta Maguad was at the time of the incident, a
 1st year Commerce student of St. Anthony's College at San Jose, 
Antique, 21 years old, single, and residing with her parents at Barrio 
Caridad, Hamtic, Antique, (pp. 1-3, t.s.n., Aug. 5, 1976). </p>
    <p>"On August 4, 1975, at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening, 
Henrietta, together with other students, was waiting for a ride in front
 of St. Anthony's College in San Jose, Antique, on her way home to 
Hamtic after attending classes (pp. 4-6, t.s.n., ibid).  A few minutes 
later, a pick-up vehicle driven by accused-appellant herein, Arthur 
Mendoza, stopped in front of said students.  On board the pick-up, aside
 from accused-appellant, were Mayor Julius Pacificador of Hamtic, 
Rodolfo Mendoza, and an unindentified man.  Upon the invitation of Mayor
 Pacificador, twelve students bound for Hamtic, including complainant 
Henrietta, boarded the vehicle (pp. 7-10, id.). </p>
    <p>"Four female students occupied the driver's cabin where Arthur 
Mendoza and an unidentified man were seated.  Mayor Pacificador and 
Rodolfo Mendoza, on the other hand, transferred to the open cargo 
compartment at the rear section of the pick-up where the rest of the 
students, together with Henrietta, were accommodated.  The pick-up then 
proceeded on its way to Hamtic, Antique, where the accused-appellant 
herein and his brother Rodolfo Mendoza reside (pp. 10-13, t.s.n., id.). </p>
    <p>"At the crossing of La Paz Hamtic, Mayor Pacificador and one 
female student named Marianita Rumbines alighted (pp. 17-18, id).  
Thereafter, the pick-up continued its journey towards the poblacion of 
Hamtic.  Upon reaching Hamtic's public market, the rest of the students 
disembarked except for complainant Henrietta who was prevailed upon by 
Arthur and Rodolfo Mendoza to stay on the assurance that they would drop
 her at her residence in Barrio Caridad, Hamtic, about 100 meters away 
from the public market (pp. 18-20, 24-25, id.). </p>
    <p>"Henrietta was thus left in the open cargo compartment of the 
pick-up together with Rodolfo Mendoza.  She was then seated on the spare
 tire which was lying on the compartment's floor, while inside the 
driver's cabin were accused Arthur Mendoza and the unidentified man (pp.
 11, 18-19, id.). </p>
    <p>"Upon reaching Barrio Caridad, complainant Henrietta stood up and
 tapped the back portion of the driver's cabin for the vehicle to stop, 
at the same time saying, "Stop, Stop!".  The pick-up, however, did not 
stop.  Instead accused Arthur Mendoza increased its speed.  Henrietta 
thus shouted "Stop, Stop," but the pick-up still continued on its way.  
At that very moment, Rodolfo Mendoza boxed Henrietta in the abdomen to 
silence her.  Sensing danger, Henrietta shouted for help, but Rodolfo 
Mendoza boxed her again in the abdomen twice.  As a consequence, 
Henrietta crumbled in pain and collapsed on the floor of the cargo 
compartment trying to catch her breath (pp. 25-26, 29, 30, 38, id.). </p>
    <p>"Shortly thereafter, while they were still within the vicinity of
 Hamtic, Antique, accused Arthur Mendoza stopped and parked the vehicle 
near a ricefield where there were trees.  Arthur Mendoza then alighted 
and hurriedly went to Henrietta.  He was followed by the unidentified 
man.  Immediately, Arthur covered the mouth of Henrietta with his hands.
  At the same time, Rodolfo Mendoza put his arms around Henrietta's 
armpits, while the unidentified man held Henritta's wrists.  Together, 
the trio carried the struggling Henrietta out of the vehicle to a 
secluded place in the ricefields 10 meters away from the elevated 
national road (pp. 30-35, id.). </p>
    <p>"When they reached the ricefield, the trio forced Henrietta to 
lie down on her back.  Rodolfo Mendoza held Henrietta's breast while 
pressing her shoulder down to the ground.  Simultaneously, the 
unidentified man held Henrietta's two legs, while Arthur Mendoza covered
 her mouth with his hands.  In the meantime, Henrietta was struggling 
and kicking to free herself, but to no avail (pp. 36, 38-39, id.). </p>
    <p>"When Henrietta was already lying on the ground, Arthur Mendoza 
hurriedly pulled open with his right hand the zipper of Henrietta's 
jeans as his left hand covered her mouth to prevent her from shouting.  
Arthur then forcibly pulled down Henrietta's jeans together with her 
bikini panty down to below her knees.  In the process, the panty as well
 as the jean's hip line and seam line were torn (pp. 36-38, t.s.n., Aug.
 5, 1976; p. 86, t.s.n., Sept. 9, 1976; Exhs. "A", "A-1", "A-2" and 
"A-3", Rec.). </p>
    <p>"Then, the unidentified man who was holding Henrietta's legs 
removed the jeans and the panty from Henrietta's left leg, leaving them 
hanging on the right leg.  Thereafter, Arthur took off his pants and 
brief.  As Arthur was about to place himself on top of Henrietta, the 
unidentified man spread her legs apart and moved backward from between 
Henrietta's legs which he was tightly holding to give room for Arthur 
Mendoza.  When Arthur was already on top of Henrietta, he began pushing 
his sex organ towards Henrietta's private part.  Henrietta, on the other
 hand, continued to struggle.  She was crying and was moving her hip 
sidewards to avoid penetration.  Arthur nonetheless, was able to insert 
his penis inside her vagina.  Because of the penetration, Henrietta felt
 pain and her private part started to bleed.  Arthur then went on a 
push-and-pull movement.  After a couple of minutes, Arthur ejaculated 
inside Henrietta.  Having satisfied his carnal desire the 
accused-appellant then stood up and put on his brief and trousers.  
Henrietta, who was crying in shame, was then allowed to put on her torn 
panty and jeans (pp. 40-44, 89-93, id.). </p>
    <p>"Thereafter, Henrietta was brought back by the trio to the cargo 
compartment of the pick-up.  Arthur Mendoza then drove the vehicle and 
after travelling a short distance, and while the pick-up was in motion, 
the unidentified man pushed Henrietta out of the vehicle.  Henrietta 
fell hard on the pavement and was knocked unconscious by the impact. </p>
    <p>"Arthur Mendoza became apprehensive upon seeing Henrietta lying 
unconscious on the road.  He thus made a u-turn and went back to where 
Henrietta fell.  They brought Henrietta to the Antique Provincial 
Hospital where the accused tried to hide the rape incident by telling 
the attendants that Henrietta fell from the pick-up (p. 28, t.s.n., 
Sept. 8, 1978). </p>
    <p>"Henrietta remained unconscious in the hospital for 16 days, or 
until August 20, 1975 (p. 46, t.s.n., August 5, 1976).  She was examined
 and treated by Dr. Lino Hernaez of the said hospital, who submitted the
 following medical findings: </p>
    <p>"Physical findings: </p>
    <p>(1)   Abrasions, multiple (a) left face (b) left eyebrow (c) left
 shoulder (d) right face (e) upper lip (f) left elbow (g) left lumbar 
area. <br>
      (2)   Hematoma (a) occiput, left 2 inches diameter (b) peri-orbital area, right. <br>
      (3)   Fracture, simple, middle third, tibia left. </p>
    <p>Internal Findings:
    </p>
    <p>Vagina -- admits one finger easily without resistance.<br>
      Cervix -- Closed<br>
      Hymen -- laceration 9 o'clock in the face of the clock with moderate hemorrhage.<br>
      Vaginal smear -- positive for the presence of spermatozoa."
        </p>
    <p>(Medical Certificate, Exh. "E", Rec.; Bold types supplied, pp. 114-123, t.s.n., November 11, 1976). </p>
    <p>"Because of several fractures sustained by Henrietta, she was 
confined in the hospital for fifty-two days, or until September 28, 1975
 (pp. 123-126, t.s.n., November 11, 1976).  Thereafter, Henrietta filed 
this complaint for rape against Arthur Mendoza, Rodolfo Mendoza and the 
unidentified man (pp. 49-50, t.s.n., Aug. 5, 1976)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The foregoing version of the prosecution is not disputed by the 
appellant except as to the commission of the rape and the manner the 
complainant fell from the vehicle.  The story of appellant is that 
nothing untoward happened during the ride until complainant fell from 
the vehicle because she lost her balance as she tried to alight while 
the vehicle was still in motion, not that she was pushed off therefrom 
as she claimed.  Hence, his only assignment of error is the trial court 
finding him guilty of rape as charged.
</p><p>Appellant would brand the testimony of the complainant as totally
 incredible and unworthy of belief.  Thus he points to the testimony of 
the medico-legal witness that no visible external injury was found on 
the abdomen of complainant as well as to the finding of the lower court 
that there was no evidence to show that Rodolfo Mendoza stayed at the 
back compartment of the vehicle with complainant, as showing the falsity
 of her testimony that she was boxed on that part of her body by said 
Rodolfo Mendoza.
</p><p>The absence of visible external injury on the abdomen of 
complainant does not by itself disprove her assertion that she was boxed
 there by Rodolfo Mendoza.  The doctor himself explained that because of
 the softness of the abdominal region, fist blows would not necessarily 
produce hematoma or any external injury thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>As to whether there is evidence that Rodolfo Mendoza, who was 
also accused but acquitted, stayed with complainant at the back 
compartment, what better showing could there be than complainant's own 
testimony that she was boxed there by Rodolfo?  There is testimony that 
when the students boarded the pick-up, Mayor Pacificador and Rodolfo 
Mendoza transferred to the cargo compartment when four (4) female 
students occupied the driver's cabin.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  Rodolfo and complainant remained in the back compartment when the other students and the Mayor disembarked.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>Appellant then points to the testimony of Dr. Hernaez that the jeans of complainant "were not torn,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  contrary to complainant's testimony that her jeans were torn when 
appellant forcibly pulled it down. What Dr. Hernaez stated is that he 
did not notice that the jeans were torn, and this must be so because the
 torn portion is along the hip line from the waist down which was soaked
 with blood as to become not immediately noticeable.  The jeans which 
was presented in court as exhibits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  showed the torn portion.
</p><p>Pursuing his attempt to assail complainant's credibility, 
appellant contends that if the unknown man was sitting between her legs 
as she testified when she was forced to lie on the ground, it would not 
be possible for him (appellant) to have performed sexual intercourse on 
top of her, as she pictured the manner the crime was committed.
</p><p>As the Solicitor General clearly demonstrated, the argument of 
appellant is misleading, as he quoted only portions of complainant's 
testimony on this particular matter.  Quoted more fully, complainant's 
testimony would show that before appellant placed himself on top of her,
 the unknown man moved backward to give way to appellant.  Thus -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>"Q.  Where was the person who has hold you by the legs when Arthur Mendoza had pulled off the panty and the jeans? </p>
  <p>A.  While my legs had spread apart, that person who was then holding my legs was sitting on the place between my legs.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>COURT:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Q.  You mean to say with a person sitting between your legs which 
were spread apart, Arthur Mendoza was able to lie on top of you?
  </p>
  <p>A.  Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>Q.  How far or in what particular portion between your legs did 
this person sit between your ankle or knee space, between the feet and 
the knee?
  </p>
  <p>A.  When Arthur Mendoza laid on top of me the person whom I do not 
know moved a little backward, held me by my legs and below the knee and 
spread it apart.
  </p>
  <p>(pp. 41-42, t.s.n., Aug. 5, 1976)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, appellant would mislead this Court in claiming complainant to 
have contradicted herself when she said that it was Arthur Mendoza who 
pressed her shoulders to the ground but that in answer to the Court, she
 said it was Baby (Rodolfo) Mendoza who did.  Her testimony shows that 
she mentioned "Baby Mendoza" but it was the trial court in its decision 
which mentioned Arthur Mendoza erroneously, instead of Baby Mendoza, 
either by honest mistake or that the mistake was due only to 
typographical error.
</p><p>The fact that her left shoulder was pressed to the ground and her
 right hand was pinned by the body of appellant explains why complainant
 did not succeed in her effort to scratch the back of Baby Mendoza, even
 if her hands were free as she stated, which appellant tried to stress, 
again to show another alleged flaw in complainant's testimony.
</p><p>That complainant's panty was not presented in evidence does not 
create a "serious doubt" as appellant claims, entitling appellant to 
acquittal.  This contention is far-fetched, in light of the very 
plausible explanation given by complainant that because it was dirty it 
had to be washed.  It would, therefore, serve no practical or useful 
purpose to present it in court, specially as it would only be 
corroborative in effect.  What is instead demonstrated is complainant's 
disinclination, if not complete aversion, to do anything that would 
subject her to shameful embarrassment and degrading experience except 
when so compelled to vindicate her honor.  In any case, this piece of 
evidence is unnecessary in the face of the overwhelming evidence already
 presented that she was a victim of rape.
</p><p>The physical examination conducted only 30 minutes after the rape,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  showed unmistakable signs of its commission.  Dr. Hernaez noticed 
profused bleeding and rugosities in the vagina.  A vaginal smear test 
yielded positive results for the presence of spermatozoa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  There was a fresh laceration at 9:00 o'clock in the hymen<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  and the breasts had signs of bruises.
</p><p>That complainant was raped in the manner she narrated, and by no 
other person than appellant admits of not the least doubt.  Complainant 
had been continuously in school before she took the ride in appellant's 
vehicle.  She could not have had a tryst with a lover, and perform a sex
 act with him while she is supposed to be in her classes.
</p><p>It was not unusual, as appellant would also contend, for 
complainant not to immediately tell her attending physician that she was
 raped.  How could she have done so when she was unconscious after the 
sexual assault and remained so for many days more? On regaining 
consciousness, she knew she had already been examined physically.  She 
had enough sense to know that after the examination, her attending 
physician had known what traumatic experience she had gone through.  But
 she did reveal what happened to her parents as soon as she recovered 
from unconsciousness, as was naturally to be expected in her desire to 
receive the comforting reassurance of her loved ones, after the tragedy 
that has befallen her.
</p><p>There need not be much fuss about how the injuries sustained by 
complainant were caused or inflicted.  Whether We accept the theory of 
appellant that complainant accidentally fell from the vehicle and 
sustained the injuries instead of complainant's version that she was 
deliberately pushed off the running vehicle, the liability of appellant 
for the crime of rape, in light of the other evidence, is unavoidable.  
Violence was employed by appellant to consummate the crime together with
 Rodolfo Mendoza and the third man still to be identified.  That the 
accused in this case, including Rodolfo Mendoza, abused their superior 
strength to subdue complainant's resistance is adequately proven.  That 
Rodolfo Mendoza was acquitted by the trial court under the evidence of 
record could raise some eyebrows, but this is just so much water already
 gone under the bridge.
</p><p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the judgment appealed from, being in 
accordance with law and the evidence insofar as appellant Arthur Mendoza
 is concerned, is affirmed in toto, with costs.
</p>
<p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p>
