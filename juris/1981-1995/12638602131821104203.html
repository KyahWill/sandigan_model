that the decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> only in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court and may be reversed only upon a clear showing of
a </span>grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner had been
in the employ of the Philippine Packing Corporation as a security guard for all
</span>of eighteen years when he was implicated on <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="7">24 July 1986</st1:date> in the theft of <span class="SpellE">gramoxone</span>
chemicals from the company plant by Bernie <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, a
14-year, old boy who was caught <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>flagrante</u></span>
on <st1:date year="1986" day="22" month="7">22 July 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This boy said it was the petitioner who had
asked him to take the chemicals out of the company compound.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

One other person, Security Guard <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Adalin</span>, Jr., executed an affidavit to the effect that he
had seen the petitioner actually carrying the chemicals two days earlier in a
plastic bag.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Investigated in </span>the office <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>the security department of the
private respondent, the petitioner admitted his guilt, saying that "my act
of giving Belen (the boy's mother) the <span class="SpellE">gramoxone</span>
chemicals was committed by me because of pity for her and I was also beguiled
by her caresses."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He begged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">forgiveness from the company
and asked that he be </span>transferred to another unit away from Belen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A complaint for qualified theft <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>filed
against him in the municipal circuit trial court of <span class="SpellE">Jasaan-Claveria</span>

when the petitioner wrote the plantation manager of the PPC and requested that,
as he had already admitted the theft, he be allowed to resign without pay and
the criminal charge against him be dropped.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The prosecution was revived, however, when the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

reinstatement in view of the lapse of the 30-day period of his suspension.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the records of the case to the NLRC for resolution.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC accepted the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="1">12 January 1988</st1:date>,
it reversed the decision of the labor arbiter and held that the petitioner had
been legally dismissed and so was not entitled to reinstatement and the payment
of back wages or separation pay and the other awards.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Disagreeing, the petitioner is now before us and faults the public respondent
with grave abuse of discretion for sustaining the PPC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of whether or not the appeal had been seasonably
made, we hold in favor of the respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that in <span class="SpellE">Vir</span>-Jen Shipping and Marine
Services v. NLRC,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">we </span>interpreted
the 10-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period prescribed by Article
223 of the Labor Code for appealing to the NLRC as referring to calendar and
not working days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also true that
the private respondent filed the appeal on the twelfth calendar day following
its receipt of a copy of the appealed decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It appears, however, that the appeal could not have been filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="7">18 July 1987</st1:date>, the tenth calendar day,
because this was a Saturday and the offices of the NLRC in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City were closed; and neither could it have
been sent by registered mail because the post office was also closed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following day <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was </span>a Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal
was therefore seasonably filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="7">Monday,
 20 July 1987</st1:date>, the earliest day this could have been done after the
lapse of the 10-day period.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the dismissal, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">it </span>does
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not </span>appear that the NLRC erred
in holding that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the finding that the
petitioner was guilty of stealing the <span class="SpellE">gramoxone</span>
chemicals from the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed there
was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner himself had admitted
the offense not once but twice and in writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He even gave the reason for committing the offense, to wit, he was
beguiled by Belen's caresses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot
turn back on his own statements now and claim he was unaware of its contents
and had been deceived into making them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even the sequence of events supports the conclusion that he had really
admitted his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original complaint was withdrawn by the PPC after he had
acknowledged the theft and asked for separation without pay but this was
revived when his counsel demanded his client's reinstatement and back
wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original complaint would not
have been withdrawn in the first place had he not confessed his offense and
asked that the charge be dropped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, the petitioner had a change of heart after he had consulted
a lawyer who advised him to insist instead on his reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner claims that "he was intimidated, coerced,
pressured, influenced and threatened to sign" papers prepared in advance
by the PPC and "naive, gullible and innocent as he was, petitioner was
compelled against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">his will to </span>sign those papers."<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It takes more than tautology to prove one's
point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that short of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">redundant self-serving statements, the petitioner offers no hard
evidence of the compulsion exerted on him and has not even identified any of
the persons who allegedly forced him to sign </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">admissions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Given this infirmity </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the petition, the Court has no alternative but
to sustain the findings of the respondent NLRC that there was indeed valid
reason for separating the petitioner from his employment.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court also notes that
the offense for which the petitioner was validly separated involves his
integrity, which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">especially required for the position of
security guard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The company had relied
on his honesty in the protection of its property but it has turned out that he
was not deserving of its confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither is he worthy of compassion as to deserve at least separation pay
for his length of service for as we said in the case of Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. v. NLRC:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>We hold that henceforth separation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">pay shall</span> be allowed as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>measure of social justice only in those instances where the employee is
validly dismissed for causes other than serious misconduct or those reflecting
on his moral character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the reason
for the valid dismissal is, for example, habitual intoxication or an offense
involving moral turpitude, like theft or illicit sexual relations with a fellow
worker, the employer may not be required to give the dismissed employee
separation pay, or financial assistance, or whatever other name it is called on
the ground of social justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A contrary rule would, as the petitioner correctly argues, have the
effect of rewarding rather than punishing the erring employee for his
offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And we do not agree that the
punishment is his dismissal only and that the separation pay has nothing to do
with the wrong <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he has committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course it has.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the employee who steals from the
company is granted separation pay even as he is validly dismissed, it is not
unlikely that he will commit a similar offense </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his next employment because he thinks he can
expect a little leniency if he is again found out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This kind of misplaced compassion is not
going to do labor in general any good as it will encourage the infiltration of
its ranks by those who do not deserve the protection and concern of the
Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The policy of social justice is not intended to countenance
wrongdoing simply because it is committed by the underprivileged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At best it may mitigate the penalty but it
certainly will not condone the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Compassion for the poor is an imperative of every humane society but
only when the recipient <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is not a rascal
claiming an undeserved </span>privilege.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Social justice cannot be permitted to be the refuge of scoundrels any
more than can equity be an impediment to the punishment of the guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those who invoke social justice may do so
only if their hands are clean and their motives blameless and not simply
because they happen to be poor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
great policy of our Constitution is not meant for the protection of those who
have proved they are not worthy of it, like the workers who have tainted the
cause of labor with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>blemishes
of their own character.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
