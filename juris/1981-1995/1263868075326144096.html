the case was elevated to this Court for automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conviction is based on the following findings of fact of the
trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"June 22, 1981, at about 2:30 o'clock, a.m., a passenger
jeepney with Plate No. 632 CS, PUJ, driven by Bernabe Poyuaon, was on its way
from Rizal Avenue, Manila to Baclaran, Metro Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the jeepney as passengers while it was
already nearing the Philippine General Hospital along Taft Avenue were some 13
persons who were seated as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the left seat (which is directly behind the driver) were a male passenger
immediately behind the driver, Leopoldo Espellego, Annabelle Javier, Gina
Salvador, and a male passenger who was seated just at the entrance of the
jeepney, in that order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the right
seat beginning from the entrance of the jeepney were a male passenger, Maria
Lourdes Javier, Rodrigo Conde, Perpetuo Aquino and Wong Ngaw, also in that
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beside the driver were two male
passengers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The jeepney was travelling southward along Taft Avenue when the passenger
seated last on the left seat near the entrance of the jeepney and who turned
out to be the accused, Ruben Lee, drew out a gun and first poked it at Gina
Salvador who was to his left and then waived (sic) said gun at the other
passengers, at the same time announcing a hold-up as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Mga putang ina ninyo, huag kayong sisigaw,
hold-up ito' (Sons of bitches, don't shout.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a hold-up).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Simultaneously, the passenger seated in front of Ruben Lee who turned
out to be Quirino Viray, Jr. drew out a knife and poked it at Maria Lourdes
Javier who was to his right; the passenger seated just behind the driver who
turned out to be Geronimo Gerdad drew out a gun and pointed it at the driver;
and the passenger seated further from the driver drew out and poked a knife at
the driver.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The announcement of the hold-up frightened the passengers and Ruben
Lee ordered them to hand over their wallets, watches and other valuables.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ordered Geronimo Gerdad to collect the
things of the passengers near him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gina
Salvador gave the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to Ruben
Lee:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her Seiko 5 Men's watch worth
P500.00; her Chinese gold necklace worth P200.00; cash amounting to P800.00;
and her handbag worth P15.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
Rodrigo Conde was taken a wallet worth P35.00 and containing one Australian
dollar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the others, including that
of the driver, were taken cash which were (sic) handed over to Geronimo Gerdad.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When approaching Pedro Gil Street, Ruben Lee ordered the driver to
turn right towards Roxas Boulevard and upon reaching Mabini Street, the jeepney
was noticed by the crew of Police Mobile Patrol Car No. 221 as Pedro Gil is a
one-way street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrol Car No. 221
tailed the jeepney and signalled it to a stop.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon orders of Ruben Lee, the jeepney driver stepped down to talk nicely
to the policemen (who stopped their car about seven meters behind) by telling
the latter that they entered the street by accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, Ruben Lee warned the
passengers to keep quiet, otherwise he will shoot them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Once the jeepney driver left to talk to the policemen, Ruben Lee
also stepped down, placed his gun on his seat and ordered Quirino Viray, Jr. to
take hold of it, and proceeded to the driver's seat, started the jeepney and
drove off towards Roxas Boulevard, turned left and sped towards Baclaran.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mobile Patrol Car No. 221 (with the jeepney
driver on board) followed suit with its sirens blowing and at the same time
alerting other patrol cars through its radio.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The jeepney, with Ruben Lee on the wheels, turned left towards the
airport and on reaching a dark road, turned back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, Ruben Lee ordered one of
the passengers thrown out in order to distract the attention of the
pursuers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that the passenger beside
him was thrown out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, said
passenger was not hurt; instead he ran away after hitting (sic) ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the mobile patrol car in pursuit, the
jeepney sped back to Roxas Boulevard and towards the Luneta with the
hold-uppers taking potshots at the pursuers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And because the passengers heard shots coming from behind, they were
either down on the floor or were stooping from their seats, for fear that the
policemen might shot (sic) directly at them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The jeepney finally stopped at Marvex Drive in Balintawak, Quezon City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hold-uppers jumped out of the jeepney and
engaged the pursuing policemen in a shoot out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ruben Lee pointed a gun at Gina Salvador's back and fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the firing subsided, one of the
hold-uppers, Geronimo Gerdad, was found seriously wounded and a .22 caliber
revolver (Exhibit W-1) was found near his body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the passenger victims, Leopoldo Espellego, was seriously wounded
while three others were wounded, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gina Salvador who suffered a gunshot wound; Wong Ngaw, with lacerations
and abrasions (see Exhibit F); and Perpetuo Aquino, with a lacerated wound (See
Exhibit G).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One patrol car brought
Gerdad and Espellego to the Chinese Memorial Hospital where both were
pronounced dead on arrival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gina
Salvador, Wong Ngaw and Perpetuo Aquino were brought to the Jose Reyes Memorial
Hospital where they were treated."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

filed by accused-appellant Juan Larosa dated April 29, 1988 stating that he
wants to continue his case as an appealed case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Said resolution became final on 7 June
1988 and Entry of Judgment was correspondingly made.</p>

<p class="BODY">This review should then be limited to the case of accused Juan

<p class="BODY">We shall take them up in the order they are presented.</p>

<p class="NUM">A. In support of the first assigned error, Larosa claims that the
two (2) alleged eyewitnesses presented by the prosecution, namely, Gina
Salvador and Rodrigo Conde, were not able to identify him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, as correctly pointed out by Larosa, Gina failed to
mention him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While she was very specific
as to the role and participation of accused Ruben Lee and Quirino Viray, she
candidly admitted that she "could no longer recall the hold-upper who was
sitted (sic) infront (sic) of the jeep."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
However, prosecution witness Conde positively identified Larosa as the
holdupper sitting on the front seat of the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On direct examination, he testified as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Fiscal Belmonte:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, this witness immediately aborted the
defense counsel's attempt to show that the light of the jeep was put off,
hence, it was impossible for him to see the holduppers clearly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Atty. Mangubat:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
the way when these holduper (sic) announced that it was hold-up, did they order

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Subsequent attempts on the part of the cross-examiner to
discredit Conde proved futile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
testimony was given full faith and credit by the trial court and We find no
reason to overturn such a finding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well-entrenched is the rule that appellate courts will generally not
disturb the factual findings of the trial court since the latter are in a
better position to weigh conflicting testimonies, having heard the witnesses
themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying, unless it is
found that the trial courts have plainly overlooked certain facts of substance
and value that, if considered, might affect result of case.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Equally settled is the rule that conviction may be based on the
lone testimony of an eyewitness, when the testimony is credible.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">B.<span style=""> </span>In respect to his second
assigned error, Larosa would have Us believe that at 2:00 a.m. of 22 June 1981,
he was at his house sleeping with his family.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
However, accused relies merely on his own testimony and his alibi is not
corroborated by anybody else.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>We have ruled time and
again that alibi is a weak defense for it is easy to concoct and fabricate.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

In the case at bar, We find no reason to depart from this doctrine for the
prosecution has sufficiently established the guilt of the accused Larosa.</p>

<p class="NUM">C.<span style=""> </span>In his last assigned
error, Larosa claims that he voluntarily submitted to the custody of the police
and offered no resistance when the police accosted him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Appellee that this
contention has no basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before Larosa
and the other holduppers could even be apprehended, they engaged the pursuing
police authorities in a shootout and only gave up upon realizing that they were
already surrounded by residents and <i>tanod</i> members in the vicinity.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For a surrender to be voluntary, it must be spontaneous and
should show the intent of the accused to submit himself unconditionally to the
authorities, either:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) because he
acknowledges his guilt, or (2) because he wishes to save them the trouble and
expense necessarily included for his search and capture.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
In the absence of these two (2) reasons, and in the event that the only reason
for accused's supposed surrender is to insure his safety, his arrest being
inevitable, the surrender is not spontaneous and hence, not voluntary.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly appreciated against the accused the
generic aggravating circumstances of band and craft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nighttime, however, was erroneously taken
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">A crime is committed by a band whenever more than three (3) armed
malefactors shall have acted together in the commission of an offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, commission by a band was properly appreciated as it has been
shown that when the holdup was staged, Ruben Lee, Quirino Viray, Geronimo
Gerdad (deceased), and accused Larosa were all armed with guns and knives.</p>

<p class="BODY">Craft is likewise present herein since the accused and his
cohorts pretended to be <i><u>bona</u> <u>fide</u></i> passengers of the jeep
in order not to arouse suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, once inside the jeep, they robbed the driver and the other
passengers.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to nighttime, there is no showing that it was purposely sought
for or taken advantage of to facilitate the commission of the offense or for
the purpose of impunity.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no proof that they waited for the night to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, as testified to by Rodrigo Conde,
the light of the jeep was not put off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, they did not seek the darkness of the night and were not
afraid of the light.</p>

<p class="BODY">The robbery and the resulting deaths of Leopoldo Espellego and
Geronimo Gerdad (holdupper) and physical injuries of Gina Salvador, Wong Ngaw,
and Perpetuo Aquino are included in one (1) special complex crime of robbery
with homicide and physical injuries, defined and penalized under Article 294 of
the Revised Penal Code, it being evident that the deaths and injuries occurred
by reason of or on occasion of the robbery.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
The penalty provided for therein is <i><u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u></i> to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the presence of the
aggravating circumstances of band and craft or disguise, the greater penalty,
which is death, shall be applied.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
However, in view of the provisions of the 1987 Constitution abolishing the
death penalty,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
accused Larosa is entitled to the reduced penalty of <i><u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u></i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, conformably with the new policy of this Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
the civil indemnity of P12,000.00 is increased to P50,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, considering that the judgment
against Ruben Lee and Quirino Viray, the other convicted holduppers herein, had
become final and executory as of 7 June 1988, they are solidarily liable with
Juan Larosa up to the amount of P12,000.00 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anything in excess of said amount is the sole
liability of accused Larosa.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the trial court in Criminal
Case No. CCC-VI-49 (81) finding the accused, Juan Larosa and his co-accused
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Homicide and
Physical Injuries, as defined and penalized under Article 294 of the Revised
Penal Code, is hereby AFFIRMED in all respects, except as above modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As modified, he is hereby sentenced to suffer
the penalty of <i><u>RECLUSION</u></i> <i><u>PERPETUA,</u></i> and the civil
indemnity for the death of Leopoldo Espellego is hereby increased to
P50,000.00, the first P12,000.00 of which the accused Juan Larosa shall be
jointly and severally liable with his co-accused, and for the remaining
P38,000.00 he shall be solely liable.</p>
