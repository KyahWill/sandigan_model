<p class="BODY">The facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 28, 1985, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Mainit</span>
Lumber Development Company Workers Union-United Lumber and General Workers of
the Philippines, MALDECOWU-ULGWP (ULGWP, for short), <span style="">a </span>legitimate labor organization duly registered with the Ministry
of Labor and <span style="">Employment under Registry
No. 2944-IP, filed with Regional Office No. 10, Ministry of Labor and
Employment at <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>
City, a petition for </span>certification election to determine the sole and
exclusive collective bargaining representative <span style="">among </span>the rank and file workers/employees of <span class="SpellE">Mainit</span>
Lumber Development Company Inc. (MALDECO), <span style="">a duly </span>organized, registered and existing corporation engaged in
the business of logging and saw-mill operations employing approximately 136
rank <span style="">and </span>file employees/workers (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 11; Petition; Annex "A").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was scheduled for hearing two (2)
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the first scheduled
hearing on <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1985</st1:date>,
the counsel for compulsory <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> (now
petitioner), National Association of Free Trade Union (NAFTU) requested for
postponement on the ground that he was leaving for abroad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the scheduled hearing of <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1985</st1:date>, they, however, agreed
to submit simultaneously their respective position papers within twenty (20)
days (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 17; Petition; Annex "D").</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner ULGWP, private respondent herein, <span style="">in its </span>petition and position paper
alleged, among others:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that there
was <span style="">no </span>certification election
conducted within 12 months prior to the filing of the petition; (2) <span style="">that the petition was filed within the 60 day
freedom period, i.e., CBA expired on February 28, 1985; (3) </span>that the
petition is supported by the signatures of 101 rank and file employees out of a
total of 201 employees of the employer or more than thirty percent (30%) than
that required by law (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 13; Petition; Annex
"B").</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1985</st1:date>,
the Med-Arbiter granted the petition for certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1985</st1:date>, NAFTU appealed the decision of the Med-Arbiter on the
ground that MALDECO was composed of two (2) bargaining units, the Sawmill
Division and the <span style="">Logging </span><span style="">Division, but both the petition and decision
treated these separate and distinct units only as one (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 20; Petition; Annex "E").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1986</st1:date>,
the Bureau of Labor Relations affirmed the decision (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 26; Petition; Annex "J").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, a certification election was held on separate dates at the
employer's sawmill division and logging area respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said election MALDECOWU­-ULGWP garnered a
total vote of 146 while NAFTU garnered a total of 2 votes (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 42; Petition; Annex "0").</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 26, 1986, NAFTU filed an election protest alleging
massive vote buying accompanied with grave and serious threat, force and
intimidation on the lives of 25 applicants as stated in a Joint Affidavit
attached thereto (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 28; Petition; Annexes
"K", "K-3").</p>

<p class="BODY">MALDECO filed its Manifestation on <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1986</st1:date>, which corroborated petitioner's
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to the said
Manifestation was a joint affidavit executed by thirty five (35) of its
employees/workers (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 33; Petition; Annexes
"L", "L-1").</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1986</st1:date>,
private respondent filed its position paper (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 36; Petition; Annex "M").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioner filed its opposition to private respondent's position paper (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 39; Petition; Annex "N").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="9">September
 24, 1986</st1:date>, the Med­-Arbiter dismissed the election protest (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 42; <span style="">Petition;
</span>Annex "O").</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 10, 1986, petitioner NAFTU appealed the order of the
Med-Arbiter to the Bureau of Labor Relations in Manila (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 46) which denied the appeal (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 48) and the
two motions for reconsideration (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 51, 55).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in this petition are:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS RIGHT FOR THE
MED-ARBITER TO CHANGE THE EMPLOYER FROM TWO SEPARATE BARGAINING UNITS TO ONLY
ONE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS MASSIVE VOTE
BUYING AND SERIOUS THREAT TO LIFE TO JUSTIFY INVALIDATING THE RESULT OF THE
ELECTION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT AN ELECTION PROTEST IN A
CERTIFICATION ELECTION CAN BE GIVEN DUE COURSE EVEN IF NOT ENTERED IN THE
MINUTES OF THE ELECTION.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner alleges that the employer MALDECO
was composed of two bargaining units, the Sawmill Division in <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City and the Logging Division, in <span class="SpellE">Zapanta</span> Valley, <span class="SpellE">Kitcharao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> Norte, about 80 kilometers distant from each other
and in fact, had then two separate <span class="SpellE">CBA's</span>, one for the
Sawmill Division and another for the Logging Division, both the petition and
decision referred only to one bargaining unit; that from 1979 to 1985, the
Ministry of Labor and Employment recognized the existence of two (2) separate
bargaining units at MALDECO, one for its Logging Division and another for its
Sawmill Division.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, out of two hundred and one (201) employees of
MALDECO, one hundred seventy five (175) consented and supported the petition for
certification election, thereby confirming their desire for one bargaining
representative (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 104).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, while the existence of bargaining history is a factor
that may be reckoned with in determining the appropriate bargaining unit, the
same is not decisive or conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Other factors must be considered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The test of grouping is community <span style="">or
</span>mutuality of interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
so because "the basic test of an asserted bargaining unit's acceptability
is whether <span style="">or </span>not it is
fundamentally the combination which will best assure to all employees the
exercise of their collective bargaining rights." (Democratic Labor
Association v. <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Stevedoring Company, Inc., et
al., 103 Phil. 1103 [1958].</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, there is a mutuality of interest among the employees
of the Sawmill Division and the Logging Division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their functions mesh with one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One group needs the other in the same way
that the company needs them both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
may be difference as to the nature of their individual assignments but the
distinctions are not enough to warrant the formation of a separate bargaining
unit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the issue had been raised earlier by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Bureau of Labor Relations had already
ruled on the same in its decision dated April 28, 1986 affirming the
Med-Arbiter's Order dated April 11, 1985 which granted the petition for
Certification Election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NAFTU did not
elevate the April 28, 1986 decision to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it participated in the
questioned election and later it did not raise the issue in its election
protest (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 210).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> applies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was settled as early as 1956 that “the
rule which forbids the reopening of a matter once judicially determined by
competent authority applies as well to the judicial and quasi-judicial acts of
public, executive or administrative officers and boards acting within their
jurisdiction as to the judgments of courts having general judicial powers x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (B.F. Goodrich Philippines,
Inc. v. Workmen's Compensation Commission and <span class="SpellE">Leandro</span>
M. Castro, 159 SCRA 355 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">With regards to the second and third issues raised by petitioner,
the public respondent Bureau of Labor Relations in its order dated September
24, 1986 found the following, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful perusal of the records of this case and after
considering, adducing and weighing all the pleadings, arguments, etc. and the
circumstances attendant to the instant case, this Office is of the opinion that
the grounds relied upon by the protestant NAFTU in its protest are bereft of
any merit, hence, this Office finds no cogent reason to order the invalidation
or annulment of the certification election under protest or the holding of a
run-off election thereat between no union and the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">protestee</span></span><span style="">, MALDECOWU-ULGWP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the minutes of said certification
elections conducted both at the sawmill and logging departments on August 15
and 21, 1986 respectively, of the respondent/employer showed that there was no
protest on massive vote buying accompanied with grave and serious threats,
force and intimidation raised by any of the parties who were ably represented
in said elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 2, Section
9, Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations implementing the Labor Code of the
Philippines (now Section 3, Rule VI, Book 5 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing
the Labor Code) provides that protests not so raised and contained in the
minutes of the </span>proceedings are deemed waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Allegations of vote buying, grave and serious
threats, force and intimidation are questions of fact which should be contained
in the minutes of said proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no clear and convincing proof presented by the protestant in
support of its contention, hence, we have no other alternative than to uphold
the election results."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Philippine Airlines Employees’ Association (PALEA)
v. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer-Calleja</span>,
et al., 162 SCRA 425 [1988]), this Court held that factual findings of the
Bureau of Labor Relations which are supported by substantial evidence are
binding on this Court and must be respected.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the resolution of public respondent
Bureau of Labor Relations dated <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="1">January
 29, 1987</st1:date> is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
