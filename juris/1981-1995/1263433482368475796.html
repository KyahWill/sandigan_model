				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It is a fundamental principle of law and human conduct that a
person "must, in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his
duties, act with justice, give every one his due, and observe honesty and good
faith."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This is the principle we shall apply in the case at bar to gauge the
petitioner's motives in his dealings with the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arturo de Guzman was the general manager of the Manila office of
the Affiliated Machineries Agency, Ltd., which was based in Hongkong.  On June 30, 1986, he received a telex
message from Leo A. Fialla, managing director of AMAL in its main office,
advising him of the closure of the company due to financial reverses.  This message triggered the series of events
that are the subject of this litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately upon receipt of the advise, De Guzman notified all
the personnel of the Manila office.  The
employees then sent a letter to AMAL accepting its decision to close, subject
to the payment to them of their current salaries, severance pay, and other
statutory benefits.  De Guzman joined
them in these representations.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These requests were,
however, not heeded.  </span>Consequently,
the employees, now herein, private respondents, lodged a complaint with the
NLRC against AMAL, through Leo A. Fialla and Arturo de Guzman, for illegal
dismissal, unpaid wages or commissions, separation pay, sick and vacation leave
benefits, 13th month pay, and bonus.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, the petitioner began selling some of AMAL's assets
and applied the proceeds thereof, as well as<span style=""> </span>the remaining assets, to the payment of his claims against the
company.  He also organized Susarco,
Inc., with himself <span style="">as </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">president and his wife as one of the incorporators </span><span style="">and a member of the board of directors.  This company is engaged in the same line </span>of
<span style="">business and has the same clients as
that of the dissolved AMAL.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With this development, Susarco and its officers were impleaded in
the amended complaint of the private respondents.  Later, William Quasha and/or Cirilo Asperilla were also included
in the suit as the resident agents of AMAL in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 7, 1986, the petitioner filed his own complaint with
the NLRC against AMAL for his remaining unsatisfied claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 29, 1987, Labor Arbiter Eduardo G. Magno, to whom the
petitioner's complaint was assigned, rendered a decision ordering AMAL to pay
the petitioner the amount of P371,469.59 as separation pay, unpaid salary and <span style="">commissions, after deducting the value of the
assets earlier appropriated by the petitioner.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 30, 1987, Labor Arbiter Ma. Lourdes A. Sales, who
tried the private respondents' complaint, rendered <span style="">a </span>decision -</p>

<blockquote>1.  Ordering Respondents AMAL and Arturo de
Guzman to pay jointly and severally to each Complainant separation pay computed
at one-half month pay for every year <span style="">of
</span>service, backwages for one month, unpaid salaries for June 16-30, 1986,
13th month pay from January to June 30, 1986 and incentive leave pay equivalent
to two and-a-half days pay;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Dismissing the complaint against respondents
Leo Fialla, William Quasha, Susarco, Inc. and its directors Susan de Guzman,
Pacita Castaneda, George Estomata and Cynthia Serrano for lack of basis and/or
merit;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Dismissing the claims for damages for lack
of basis;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Ordering respondents AMAL and Arturo de
Guzman to pay jointly and severally attorney's fees to Complainants equivalent
to 10% of the monetary awards herein.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This decision was on appeal affirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u> by the
NLRC, which is now faulted for grave abuse of discretion in this petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner does not dispute the jurisdiction of the Labor
Arbiter and NLRC over the complaint of the private respondents against AMAL in
view of their previous employment relationship.  He argues, however, that the public respondents acted without or
in excess of jurisdiction in holding him jointly and severally liable with AMAL
as he was not an employer of the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General and the private respondents disagree.  They maintain that the petitioner, being
AMAL's highest local representative in the Philippines, may be held personally
answerable for the private respondents' claims because he is included in the
term "employer" under Art. 212 (c), (now e) of the Labor Code which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 212.  Definitions.  -</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style=""> </span>x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>c.  "Employer"
includes any person acting in the interest of an employer, directly or
indirectly.  <span style="">x x x."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the leading case of A.C. Ransom Labor Union-CCLU vs. NLRC,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
as affirmed in the subsequent cases of Gudez vs. NLRC,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> and
Maglutac vs. NLRC,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court treated the president of the employer corporation as an
"employer" and held him solidarily liable with the said corporation
for the payment of the employees' money claims.  So was the vice-president of the employer corporation in the case
of Chua vs. NLRC.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The aforecited cases will not apply to the instant case, however,
because the persons who were there made personally liable for the employeesâ€™
claims were stockholders-officers of the respondent corporation.  In the case at bar, the petitioner, while
admittedly the <span style="">highest ranking local
representative of AMAL in the Philippines, is nevertheless not a stockholder
and much less a member of the board of directors or an officer thereof.  He is at most only a managerial employee
under Art. 212 (m) of the Labor Code, which reads in relevant part as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 212.  Definitions.  -</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>m.  Managerial employee is one who is vested
with powers and prerogatives to lay down and execute management policies and/or
to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, discharge, assign or discipline
employees.  x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As such, the petitioner cannot be held directly responsible for
the decision to close the business that resulted in his separation and that of
the private respondents.  That decision
came directly and exclusively from AMAL.  The petitioner's participation was limited to the enforcement of this
decision in line with his duties as general manager of the company.  Even in a normal situation, in fact, he
would not be liable, as a managerial employee of AMAL, for the monetary claims
of its employees.  There should be no
question that the private respondents' recourse for such claims cannot be against
the petitioner but against AMAL and AMAL alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment in favor of the private respondents could have been
enforced against the properties of AMAL located in this country except for one
difficulty.  The problem is that these
properties have already been appropriated by the petitioner to satisfy his own
claims against the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">By so doing, has the petitioner incurred liability to the private
respondents?</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter believed he had because of his bad faith and
ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Considering that Respondent A. de Guzman is guilty of bad faith in
appropriating for himself the properties of Respondent AMAL to the prejudice of
Complainants herein whose claims are known to Respondent at the time he made
the disposition of AMAL's properties, he is held jointly and severally liable
with Respondent AMAL for the award of unpaid wages, separation pay, backwages
for one month, 13th month pay and cash value of unused vacation leave.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Velayo v. Shell Co. of the Philippines,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Commercial Air Lines, Inc. (CALI), knowing that it did not have enough assets
to pay off its liabilities, called a meeting of its creditors where it
announced that in case of non-agreement on <span style="">a </span>pro-rata distribution of its assets, including the C-54 plane
in California, it would file insolvency proceedings.  Shell Company of the Philippines, one of its creditors, took
advantage of this information and immediately made a telegraphic assignment of
its credits in favor of its sister corporation in the United States.  The latter thereupon promptly attached the
plane in California and disposed of the same, thus depriving the other
creditors of their proportionate share in its value.  The Court declared that Shell had acted in bad faith and betrayed
the trust of the other creditors of CALI.  The said company was ordered to pay them compensatory damages in a sum
equal to the value of the C-54 plane at the time it assigned its credit and
exemplary damages in the sum of P25,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>quote with
approval the following observations of Labor Arbiter Sales in her decision:</p>

<blockquote>While the legitimacy of Respondent A. de Guzman's claims against
AMAL is not questioned, it must be stated that the manner and the means by
which he satisfied such claims are evidently characterized by bad faith on his
part.   For one, Respondent A. de Guzman
took advantage of his position as General Manager and arrogated to himself the
right to retain possession and ownership of all properties owned and left by
AMAL in the Philippines, even if he knew that Complainants herein have similar
valid claims for unpaid wages and other employee benefits from the Respondent
AMAL.  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another strong indication of bad faith on the part of Respondent A.
de Guzman is his filing of <span style="">a </span>separate
complaint against AMAL before the NLRC Arbitration Branch about four (4) months
after the filing of the instant case without informing this Office about the
existence of said case during the proceedings in the instant case.  This case was deemed submitted for decision
on May 18, 1987 but it was only on June 2, 1987 that Respondent <span style="">A. </span>de Guzman formally notified this
Office through <span style="">his </span>Supplemental
Position Paper of his pending complaint before Arbiter Eduardo Magno docketed <span style="">as </span>NLRC Case No. 11-4441-86.  Under Rule V, Section 4 of the revised rules
of the NLRC, it is provided that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Sec. 4.  CONSOLIDATION
OF CASES - where there are two or more cases pending before different Labor
Arbiters in the same Regional Arbitration Branch involving the <u><span style="">same employer and issues</span></u><span style=""> or </span>the same parties with different
issues, the case which was filed last shall be consolidated with the first to
avoid unnecessary costs or delay.  Such
cases shall be disposed of by the Labor Arbiter to whom the first case was
assigned." (Underscoring supplied).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Had Respondent A. de Guzman given timely notice of his complaint,
his case could have been consolidated with this case and the issues in both
cases could have been resolved in a manner that would give due consideration to
the rights and liabilities of all parties in interest at the least, in case
consolidation <span style="">is </span>objected to or
no longer possible, the Complainants herein could have been given <span style="">a </span>chance to intervene in the other
case so that whatever disposition might be rendered by Arbiter Magno would
include consideration of Complainants' claims herein.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the petitioner in the case at bar had his
own claims against AMAL and consequently had some proportionate right over its
assets.  However, this right ceased to
exist when, knowing fully well that the private respondents had similarly valid
claims, he took advantage of his position as general manager and applied AMAL's
assets in payment exclusively of his own claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Tolentino in his distinguished work on the Civil
Code:</p>

<blockquote>The exercise of <span style="">a </span>right
ends when the right disappears, and it disappears when it is abused, especially
to the prejudice of others.  The mask of
<span style="">a </span>right without the spirit of
justice which gives it life, is repugnant to the modern concept of social
law.  It cannot be said that <span style="">a </span>person exercises a right when he
unnecessarily <span style="">prejudices </span>another
or offends morals or good <span style="">customs.  Over </span>and above the specific precepts
of positive law are the supreme norms of justice which the law develops and
which are expressed in three principles:  honeste vivere, alterum non laedre and jus suum quique tribuere; and he
who violates them violates the law.  For
this reason, it is not permissible to abuse our rights to prejudice others.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The modern tendency, he continues, is to depart from the
classical and traditional theory, and to grant indemnity for damages in cases
where there is an abuse of rights, even when the act is not illicit.  Law cannot be given an <span style="">anti-social effect.  If mere fault or negligence in one's acts can make him liable for
damages </span>for <span style="">injury caused
thereby, with more reason should abuse or bad faith make him liable.  A person should be protected only when he
acts in the legitimate exercise of his right, that is, when he acts with
prudence and in good faith; but not when he acts with negligence or abuse.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The above-mentioned principles are contained in Article 19 of the
Civil Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 19.  Every person must,
in the exercise of his rights and in the performance of his duties, act with
justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is supplemented by Article 21 of the same Code, thus:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 21.  Any person who
willfully causes loss or injury to another in a manner that is contrary to
morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate the latter for the
damage.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying these provisions, we hold that although the petitioner
cannot be made solidarily liable with AMAL for the monetary demand of its
employees, he is nevertheless directly liable to them for his questionable conduct
in attempting to deprive them of their just share in the assets of AMAL.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Art. 2219, (10) of the Civil Code, moral damages may be
recovered for the acts referred to in Art. 21.  In Bert OsmeÃ±a &amp; Associates vs. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that "fraud and bad faith having been established, the award of
moral damages is in order." And in Pan <span style="">Pacific Company (Phil.) vs. Phil. Advertising Corp.,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> moral damages were awarded against the
defendant for its wanton and deliberate refusal to pay the just debt due the
plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">  It is settled that the
court can grant the relief warranted by the allegation and the proof even if it
is not specifically sought by the injured party.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> In
the case at bar, while the private respondents did not categorically pray for
damages, they did allege that the petitioner, taking advantage of his position
as general manager, had appropriated the properties of AMAL in payment of his
own claims against the company.  That
was averment enough of the injury they suffered as a result of the petitioner's
<span style="">bad faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that no actual or compensatory damages was proven before
the trial court does not adversely affect the private respondents' right to
recover moral damages.  We have held
that moral damages may be awarded in the cases referred to in the chapter on
Human Relations of the Civil Code (Articles 19-36) without need of proof that
the wrongful act complained of had caused any physical injury upon the
complainant.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When moral damages are awarded, exemplary damages may also be decreed.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Exemplary damages are imposed by way of example or correction for the public
good, in addition to moral, temperate, liquidated or compensatory damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
According to the Code Commission, "exemplary damages are required by
public policy, for wanton acts must<span style=""> be
suppressed.  They are an antidote so
that the poison of wickedness may not run through </span>the body <span style="">politic."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> These damages are legally assessible against
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner asserts that, assuming the private respondents to
have a cause of action against him for his alleged bad faith, the civil courts
and not the Labor Arbiter have jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Associated Citizens Bank, et al. vs. Judge <span style="">Japson,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Primarily, the issue to be resolved is whether or not the
respondent court <span style="">has </span>jurisdiction
to hear and decide an action for damages based on the dismissal of an employee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On all fours to the above issue is the ruling of this Court in
Primero v. Intermediate Appellate Court (156 SCRA 435 [1987]) which once again
reiterated the doctrine that the jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter under
Article 217 of the Labor Code is broad and comprehensive enough to include
claims for moral and exemplary damages sought to be recovered by an employee
whose services has been illegally terminated by his employer (Ebon v. De
Guzman, 113 SCRA 55 [1982]; Aguda v. Vallejos, 113 SCRA 69 [1982]; Getz
corporation v. Court of Appeals, 116 SCRA 86 [1982]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>For the unlawful termination of employment, this Court in Primero
v. Intermediate Appellate Court, supra, ruled that the Labor Arbiter had the
exclusive and original jurisdiction over claims for moral and other forms of
damages, so that the employee in the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter
should prosecute his claims not only for reliefs specified under the Labor Code
but also for damages under the Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x x x<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Question of damages which arose out of
or <u><span style="">connected with the labor dispute</span></u><span style=""> </span>should be determined by the labor
tribunal to the exclusion of the regular courts of justice (Limquiaco, Jr. v. Ramolete,
156 SCRA 162 [1987]).  The regular
courts have no jurisdiction over claims for moral and exemplary damages arising
from the illegal dismissal of an employee (Vargas v. Akai Philippines, Inc.,
156 SCRA 531 [1987]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although the question of damages arising from the petitioner's
bad faith has not directly sprung from the illegal dismissal, it is clearly
intertwined therewith.  The predicament
of the private respondents caused by their dismissal was aggravated by the
petitioner's act in arrogating to himself <span style="">all
</span>of AMAL's assets to the exclusion of its other creditors, including its
employees.  The issue of bad faith is
incidental to the main action for <span style="">illegal
dismissal and is thus properly cognizable by the Labor Arbiter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree that, strictly speaking, the determination of the amount
thereof would require a remand to the Labor Arbiter.  However, inasmuch as the private respondents were separated in
1986 and this case has been pending since then, the interests of justice demand
the direct resolution of this motion in this proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court has consistently declared:</p>

<blockquote>"x x <span style="">x </span>it <span style="">is a </span>cherished rule of procedure for
this Court to <span style="">always </span>strive to
settle the entire controversy in <span style="">a
single </span>proceeding leaving <span style="">no </span>root
or branch to bear the seeds of future litigation.  No useful purpose will be served if this case is remanded to the
trial court only to have its decision raised again to the Intermediate
Appellate Court and from there to this Court." (Alger Electric, Inc. v.
Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals, 135 SCRA 37)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Remand of the case to the lower court for further <span style="">reception </span>of evidence is not necessary
where the court is in a position to resolve the dispute based on the records
before it.  On many occasions, the
Court, in the public interest and the expeditious administration of justice,
has resolved actions on the merits instead of remanding them to the trial court
for further proceedings, such as where the ends of justice would not be
subserved by the remand of the case or when public interest demands an early disposition
of the case.  (Lianga Bay Logging Co.,
Inc. v. CA, 157 SCRA 357)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Sound practice seeks to accommodate the theory which avoids waste
of time, effort and expense, both to the parties and the government, not to
speak of delay in the disposal of the case (cf. Fernandez v. Garcia, 92 Phil.
592, 597).  A marked characteristic of
our judicial set-up is that where the dictates of justice so demand <span style="">x x x </span>the Supreme Court should act, and
act with finality.  (Li Siu Liat v.
Republic, 21 SCRA 1039, 1046, citing Samal v. CA, 99 Phil 230 and U.S. v.
Gimenez, 34 Phil.  74).  In this case, the dictates of justice do
demand that this Court act, and act with finality.  (Beautifont, Inc. v. CA, 157 SCRA 481)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is stressed that the petitioners' liability to the private
respondents is a direct liability in the form of moral and exemplary damages
and not a solidary liability with AMAL for the claims of its employees against
the company.  He is being held liable
not because he is the general manager of AMAL but because he took advantage of <span style="">his position by </span>applying <span style="">the properties of </span>AMAL <span style="">to the payment exclusively of his own claims
to the detriment of the other employees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned decision <span style="">is </span><span style="">AFFIRMED </span>but
with the modification that the petitioner shall not be held jointly and
severally liable with <span style="">AMAL </span>for
the private respondents' money claims against the latter.  However, for his bad faith in arrogating to
himself <span style="">AMAL's </span>properties to the
prejudice of the private respondents, the petitioner is ordered:  1) <span style="">to
</span>pay the private respondents moral damages in the sum of P20,000.00 and
exemplary damages in the sum of P20,000.00; and 2) to return the assets of <span style="">AMAL </span>that he has appropriated, or the
value thereof, with legal interest thereon from the date of the appropriation
until they are actually restored, these amounts to be proportionately
distributed among the private respondents in satisfaction of the judgment
