was further </span>alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that the
frauds were deliberately calculated to ensure the victory of RWU because it was
a company union, as was evident from the fact that despite its 33-year
incumbency during which no less than eleven (11) collective bargaining

low.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Manases</span> T. Cruz dismissed the protest for
lack of merit and declared the election results final and RWU the certified
exclusive bargaining agent of all the rank-and-file workers of La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He found no
substantial evidence to support the protestant's charges of fraud and gave
credit to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Election Minutes
attesting to the integrity of the election.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, however, to the respondent Director of Labor

was rendered annulling the certification election and ordering that another
election <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be held.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her decision, said respondent accorded
full credence to the allegations made in the protest, found these to have been
sufficiently proven by the protestant's evidence consisting of a "</span><span class="SpellE">Kapasyahan/Resolusyon</span>" dated September 24, 1987<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

to the first of said documents:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
before the election about 200 workers were detained in their work stations and
thereby prevented from voting; (2) early in the morning of the election,
management distributed free T-shirts to workers who were then taken to the
election booths to vote; (3) construction men, not company employees, working
in a building within the company premises were issued employee identification
cards enabling them to vote in the election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The sworn statement is allegedly to the effect that the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span> (Eric <span class="SpellE">Gamueda</span>) was one
of those construction workers who was issued a La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
employee's identification card so that he could vote in the election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Director also faulted the
petitioner for opposing the protest by mere general averment without
categorically refuting the charges of fraud.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having twice filed for reconsideration and been rebuffed both
times, RWU finally instituted the present petition, impugning the respondent
Director's decision as rendered with grave abuse of discretion in that the
factual <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">conclusions made therein are
without support in the evidence and rest on nothing more substantial than the
protestant's bare allegations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> took up the cudgels for the petitioner,
denied having intervened in the election or connived with the petitioner in any
cheating, and echoed the charge that the Director's decision was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">tainted with grave abuse of discretion for
want of substantial evidentiary basis.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">It being well-settled rule that the findings of fact of

all that is necessary in order to resolve this case is to determine whether or
not evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of such character exists
or has been presented which would justify the decision of the respondent
Director.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From even a perfunctory
assessment, it becomes apparent that the "evidence" upon which said
decision is professedly based does not come up to that standard of
substantiality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither the "<span class="SpellE">Kapasyahan/Resolusyon</span>"
nor the <span class="SpellE">Gamueda</span> statement was identified by their
purported authors or signatories.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>None
of the one hundred or more employees who supposedly signed that manifesto was

therefore, both documents were nothing but mere scraps of paper without
evidentiary value and, indeed, were not even admissible against herein

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">It </span>is of course

is implicitly recognized in <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Art. </span>221

<p class="BODY">The clear message of the law is that even in the disposition of
labor cases, due process must never be subordinated to expediency or
dispatch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon this principle, the
unidentified documents relied upon by the respondent Director must be seen and
taken for what they a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">re, mere
inadmissible hearsay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They cannot, by
any stretch of reasoning, be deemed substantial evidence of the election frauds

<p class="2Q">"* * * (the) assurance of a desirable flexibility in
administrative procedure does not go so far as to justify orders without a
basis in evidence having rational probative force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Mere uncorroborated hearsay or rumor does
not constitute substantial evidence."</u></p>

<p class="BODY">But even given the benefit of every doubt as to their
admissibility, said statements still fail to qualify as credible or persuasive
evidence of the alleged frauds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
"<span class="SpellE">Resolusyon/Kapasyahan</span>," for one, is so
sketchy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">in </span>content that it gives
the impression of being no more than a collection of general allegations
presented ready-made to people <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">who </span>signed
it without really knowing or caring about whether they were true or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It states, for example, that more than 200
employees were not allowed to vote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
that figure must have been plucked out of thin air because <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">there are repeated </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">references in the record</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the respondent union (CFW) has never seriously disputed that the voters list

the official tally, thus leaving only </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

of an agreed voters list against which the identity of every prospective voter
could be checked also renders quite implausible the insinuation made in said
statements that anyone who presented himself at the polling place with an
employee's identification card would be allowed to vote without question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The election minutes record that in the one
instance where a voter's status as an employee was questioned by a CFW
representative, although his name appeared in the voters </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">list </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

segregated </span>by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the DOLE

<p class="BODY">It results that the only relevant and competent evidence
regarding the conduct of the certification election is the election minutes
accomplished and signed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the DOLE
supervision team, and according to which the election proceeded in a "* *
* free, clean, honest, peaceful and orderly manner." Based on said
evidence, it is the Med-Arbiter's decision according it faith and credit that
should </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">upheld, in preference
to that of the </span>respondent Director which, in ignoring said minutes and

<p class="BODY">The role played by La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> in the
disputed election as well as in these proceedings has not escaped the Court's
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the charges of its
active intervention and <span class="SpellE">electioneerng</span> have not been

This Court has time and again ruled that the employer is not a party in a
certification election, which activity is the sole concern of the workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only instance in which an employer may
