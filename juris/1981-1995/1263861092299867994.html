				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, the resolution of
the public respondent dated August 3, 1978, is faulted for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) affirming the decision of the labor
arbiter dismissing the employees' claim for emergency allowance for lack of
jurisdiction; and (b) modifying the said decision by disallowing the award of
back wages to petitioners <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span> and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1974</st1:date>,
respondent Philippine Labor Alliance Council (PLAC) and respondent Liberty
Flour Mills, Inc. entered into <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>three-year
collective bargaining agreement effective <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1974</st1:date>, providing for a daily wage increase of
P2.00 for 1974, P1<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.00 </span>for 1975
and another P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1.00 </span>for 1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The agreement contained a compliance clause,
which will be explained later in this opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Additionally, the parties agreed to establish <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">a </span>union shop by imposing “membership in good standing for the
duration of the CBA as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>condition
for continued employment” of workers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1974</st1:date>,
PLAC filed a complaint against the respondent company for non-payment of the
emergency cost-of-living allowance under P.D. No. 525.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
A similar complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="3">March
 4, 1975</st1:date>, this time by the petitioners, who apparently were already
veering <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">away </span>from PLAC.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span>,
after organizing a union called the Federation of National Democratic Labor
Unions, filed with the Bureau of Labor Relations a petition for certification
election among the rank-and-file employees of the respondent company.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
PLAC then expelled the two for disloyalty and demanded their dismissal by the
respondent company, which complied on <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="5">May
 20, 1975</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The objections of <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span> to their termination were certified for compulsory
arbitration and assigned to Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
N. <span class="SpellE">Lomabao</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, the claims for emergency allowance were referred for
voluntary arbitration to <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> Cabal, who
eventually dismissed the same on the ground that the allowances were already
absorbed by the wage increases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
latter case was ultimately also certified for compulsory arbitration and
consolidated with the termination case being heard by <span class="SpellE">Lomabao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">His </span>decision
was, on appeal, dealt with by the NLRC as above stated,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and the motion for reconsideration was denied on <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1981</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, we note that the petitioners are taking an
ambivalent position concerning the CBA concluded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>1974.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While claiming
that this was entered into in bad faith and to forestall the payment of the
emergency allowances expected to be decreed, they nonetheless invoke the same
agreement to support their contention that their complaint for emergency
allowances was invalidly referred to voluntary arbitrator Cabal rather than <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Bacuñgan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find there was <span class="GramE">no such violation as the
choice of the voluntary arbitrator was not limited to <span class="SpellE">Bacuñgan</span>
although he was probably the first preference</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the petitioners are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from raising this objection now because they did
not seasonably interpose it and instead willingly submitted to Cabal's
jurisdiction when he undertook to hear their complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sustaining Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Lomabao</span>,
the NLRC agreed that the decision of Voluntary Arbiter Cabal was final and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span> under Article 262-A of the Labor Code and so
could no longer be reviewed by it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True
enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>equally true that the same decision
is not binding on this Court, as we held in Oceanic <span class="SpellE">Bic</span>
Division (FFW) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v. </span>Romero<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Mantrade</span>/FMMC Division Employees
and Workers Union v. <span class="SpellE">Bacuñgan</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The rule as announced in these cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
</span>reflected in the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>In spite of statutory provisions making “final” the decision of
certain administrative agencies, we have taken cognizance of petitions
questioning these decisions where want of jurisdiction, grave abuse of
discretion, violation of due process, denial of substantial justice, or
erroneous interpretation of the law were brought to our attention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>A voluntary arbitrator by the nature of her functions acts in a
quasi-judicial capacity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
reason why her decisions involving interpretation of law should be beyond this
Court's review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Administrative officials
are presumed to act in accordance with law and yet we do not hesitate to pass
upon their work where a question of law is involved or where a showing of abuse
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">authority or </span>discretion in
their official acts is properly raised in petitions for <i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the validity of the voluntary arbiter's finding that
the emergency allowance sought by the petitioners are already absorbed in the
stipulated wage increases will now be examined by the Court itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The position of the company is that the emergency allowance
required by P.D. No. 525 is already covered by the wage increases prescribed in
the said CBA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, pursuant to
its Article VIII, such allowances also include all other statutory minimum wage
increases that might be decreed during the lifetime of the said agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">That agreement provided in Section 2 thereof as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Section 2.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The wage increase in the amounts and during the period above set forth
shall, in the event of any statutory increase of the minimum wage, either as
allowance or as basic wage, during the life of this Agreement, be considered
compliance and payment of such required statutory increase as far as it will go
and under no circumstances will it be cumulative nor duplication to the
differential amount involved consequent to such statutory wage increase.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court holds that such allowances are indeed absorbed by the
wage increases required under the agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is because Section 6 of the Interpretative Bulletin on LOI No. 174
specifically provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 6.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Allowances under LOI</u>.</span> - All allowances,
bonuses, wage adjustments and other benefits given by employers to their
employees shall be treated by the Department of Labor as in substantial
compliance with the minimum standards set forth in LOI No. 174 if:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>they</u></span><u>
conform with at least the minimum allowances scales specified in the
immediately preceding Section;</u> and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>they are given <u>in
response to the appeal of the President in his speech on 4 January 1974, or to
countervail the quantum jump in the cost of living as a result of the energy
crisis starting in November 1973, or pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 390;
Provided</u>, That the payment is retroactive to <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="2">18 February 1974</st1:date> or earlier.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The allowances and other benefits may be granted unilaterally by
the employer or through collective bargaining, and may be paid at the same time
as the regular wages of the employees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Allowances and other benefits which are not given in substantial
compliance with the LOI as interpreted herein shall not be treated by the
Department of Labor as emergency allowances in the contemplation of the LOI
unless otherwise shown by sufficient proof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, without such proof, escalation clauses in collective bargaining
agreements concluded <u>before the appeal of the President providing for
automatic or periodic wage increases</u> shall not be considered allowances for
purposes of the LOI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The “immediately preceding section” referred to above states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>5.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Determination of Amount
of Allowances</u>.</span> - In determining the amount of allowances that should
be given by employers to meet the recommended minimum standards, the LOI has
classified employers into three general categories.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As an implementation policy, the Department
of Labor shall consider as sufficient compliance with the scales of allowances
recommended by the LOI if the following monthly allowances are given by
employers:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>P50.00 or higher where
the authorized capital stock of the corporation, or the total assets in the
case of other undertakings, exceeds P1million;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>P30.00 or higher where
the authorized capital stock of the corporation, or the total assets in the
case of other undertakings, is not less than P100,000.00 but not more than P1
million; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>P15.00 or higher where
the authorized capital stock or total assets, as the case may be, is less than
P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that the company falls under paragraph (a), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>it has a capitalization of more
than P1 million,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and so must pay a minimum allowance of P50.00 a month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This amount is clearly covered by the
increases prescribed in the CBA, which required a monthly increase (on the
basis of 30 days) of P60.00 for 1974, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to
</span>be increased by P30.00 in 1975 (to P90.00) and another <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P30.00 in 1976 (to P120.00).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first increase in 1974 was already above
the minimum allowance of P50.00, which was exceeded even more with the
increases of P1.00 for each of the next two years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if the basis used were 26 days a month (excluding Sundays),
the conclusion would remain unchanged as the raise in wage would be P52.00 for
1974, which amount was increased to P78.00 in 1975 and to P104.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But the petitioners contend that the wage increases were the
result of negotiation undertaken long before the promulgation of P.D. No. 525
and so should not be considered part of the emergency allowance decreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of this contention, they cite
Section 15 of the Rules implementing P.D. No. 525, providing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>Nothing herein shall prevent the employer and his employees, from
entering into any agreement with terms more favorable to the employees than
those provided herein, or be construed to sanction the diminution of any
benefits granted to the employees under existing laws, agreements, and
voluntary practice.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, this section should not be read in isolation but must
be related to the other sections above-quoted, to give effect to the intent and
spirit of the decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The meaning of the
section simply is that any benefit over and above the prescribed allowances <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">may </span>still be agreed upon by the
employees and the employer or, if already granted, may no longer be withdrawn
or diminished.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also maintain that the above-quoted Section 2 of
CBA is invalid because it constitutes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a
</span>waiver by the laborers of future benefits that may be granted them by
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contend this cannot be done
because it is contrary to public policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the principle is correct, the application is not, for there
are no benefits being waived under the provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The benefits are already included in the wage
increases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the law itself that
considers these increases, under the conditions prescribed in LOI No. 174, as
equivalent to, or in lieu of, the emergency allowance granted by P.D. No. 525.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the company agreed to grant the emergency allowance even
before the obligation was imposed by the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the petitioners claim they are being
made to waive is the additional P50.00 allowance but the truth is that they are
not entitled to this because they are already enjoying the stipulated
increases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no waiver of these
increases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Section 2 provides that the wage increase shall be
considered payment of any statutory increase of the minimum wage “as far as it
will go,” which means that any amount not covered by such wage increase will
have to be made good by the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
short, the difference between the stipulated wage increase and the statutory
minimum <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">wage </span>will have to be
paid by the company notwithstanding and, indeed, pursuant to the said
article.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is no </span>waiver as to this.</p>

<p class="BODY">Curiously, Article 2 was reproduced <u>verbatim</u> in the
collective bargaining agreement concluded by the petitioners with the company
in 1977 after PLAC had been replaced by the new labor union formed by
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It is difficult to understand the petitioners' position when they blow hot and
cold like <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the second issue, we find that it must also be
resolved against the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span>
claim they were illegally dismissed for organizing another labor union opposed
to PLAC, which they describe as a company union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arguing that they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">were </span>only exercising the right to self-organization <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>guaranteed by the Constitution,
they insist they are entitled to the back wages which the NLRC disallowed while
affirming their reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its challenged decision, the public respondent held that in
demanding the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span>, PLAC had acted prematurely because the 1974 CBA
providing for a union shop and pursuant to which the two petitioners were
dismissed had not yet been certified.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The implication is that it was not yet in effect and so could not be the basis
of the action taken against the two petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It disregards the ruling of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> Distillery Labor Union v. NLRC,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
where we held:</p>

<blockquote>The fact, therefore, that the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR)
failed to certify or act on <span class="SpellE">TDLU's</span> request for
certification of the CBA in question is of no moment to the resolution of the
issues presented in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The BLR
itself found in its order of July 8, 1982, that the “(un) <u>certified CBA was
duly filed and submitted</u> on October 29, 1980, to last until June 30, 1982
is <u>certifiable</u> for having complied with all the requirements for
certification.” (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The CBA concluded in 1974 was certifiable and was in fact
certified on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears stressing that <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span> were dismissed only on <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1975</st1:date>, more than a month after
the said certification.</p>

<p class="BODY">The correct view is that expressed by Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> P. Seno in his concurring and dissenting opinion,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>viz</u>.:</p>

<blockquote>I cannot however subscribe to the majority view that the “dismissal
of complainants <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span>,
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> was, to say the
least, a premature action on the part of the respondents because at the time
they were expelled by PLAC the contract containing the union security clause
upon which the action was based was yet to be certified and the representation
status of the contracting union was still in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Evidence on record show that after the cancellation of the
registration certificate of the Federation of Democratic Labor Unions, no other
union contested the exclusive representation of the Philippine Labor Alliance
Council (PLAC), consequently, there was no more legal impediment that stood on
the way as to the validity and enforceability of the provisions of the
collective bargaining agreement entered into by and between respondent
corporation and respondent union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
certification of the collective bargaining agreement by the Bureau of Labor
Relations is not required to put a stamp of validity to such contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once it is duly entered into and signed by
the parties, a collective bargaining agreement becomes effective as between the
parties regardless of whether or not the same has been certified by the BLR.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To be fair, it must be mentioned that in the certification
election held at the Liberty Flour Mills, Inc. on <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1976</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Ilaw</span> at <span class="SpellE">Buklod</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>,
with which the union organized by <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> was affiliated, won overwhelmingly with 441 votes
as against the 5 votes cast for PLAC.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
However, this does not excuse the fact that the two disaffiliated from PLAC as
early as March 1975 and thus rendered themselves subject to dismissal under the
union shop clause in the CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners say that the reinstatement issue of <span class="SpellE">Evaristo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Biascan</span> has become
academic because the former has been readmitted and the latter has chosen to
await the resolution of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, they still insist on the payment of their back wages on the
ground that their dismissal was illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This claim must be denied for the reasons already given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The union shop clause was validly enforced
against them and justified the termination of their services.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the policy of the State to promote unionism to enable the
workers to negotiate with management on the same level and with more
persuasiveness than if they were <span class="GramE">to</span> individually and
independently bargain for the improvement of their respective conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To this end, the Constitution guarantees to
them the rights “to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations and
peaceful concerted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">actions </span>including
the right to strike in accordance with law.” There is no question that these
purposes could be thwarted if every worker were to choose to go his own
separate way instead of joining his co-employees in planning collective action
and presenting a united front when they sit down to bargain with their
employers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that
the law has sanctioned stipulations for the union shop and the closed shop as a
means of encouraging the workers to join and support the labor union of their
own choice as their representative in the negotiation of their demands and the
protection of their interests <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">vis-a-vis</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>the
employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court would have preferred to resolve this case in favor of
the petitioners, but the law and the facts are against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For all the concern of the State, for the
well-being of the worker, we must at all times conform to the requirements of
the law as long as such law has not been shown to be <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No such violation
has been shown here.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED, without <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">any </span>pronouncement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>to costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>
