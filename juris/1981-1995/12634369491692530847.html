October 27, 1987, accused REYNALDO MONTALBO and OPINIADO DOLAR were charged
with ROBBERY WITH RAPE, allegedly committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about October 24 1987, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together and
mutually helping each other, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and

damage and prejudice of said owners in the said sum of <span style="">P1,170.00 Philippine Currency; that on said occasion, the said robbery
was accompanied by rape in that said Opiniado Dolar y Evalla in pursuance of
their conspiracy with each other, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously, by means of force, violence and intimidation, to wit:  <b>by then and there poking the knife at the

her, against her will and consent</b>.  (emphasis ours)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Contrary to
law."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon their arraignment on December 11, 1987, the accused pleaded
not guilty<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and underwent trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence show that at around eight thirty in
the evening of October 24, 1987, Danilo Permison and his nineteen year-old
girlfriend, Leny Reli, were walking along Bonifacio Drive, Port Area, Manila.  From Anda Circle, they headed towards the
Philippine Coast Guard headquarters.  Across the Bonifacio Drive was the lighted NAPOCOR building.  Suddenly, Reynaldo Montalbo and Opiniado
Dolar darted from <span style="">a </span>dark portion
of the area.  Sensing danger, Danilo and
Leny evaded the two.  However, it was
too late.  Dolar collared and poked a
fan knife <i><span style="">(balisong) </span></i>on
Danilo.  Montalbo, on the other hand,
poked <span style="">a fan </span>knife on Leny.  Both accused warned them: <i><span style="">"Huwag (kayong) </span>sisigaw at baka </i><i><span style="">papatayin namin kayo." </span></i>(Don't
shout or we will kill you).<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Danilo and Leny were dragged to the darker portion of the
area.  The hold-uppers, again,
threatened to kill them should they refuse to give their money and
jewelry.  They obeyed.  As Danilo was getting the wallet from his pocket,
accused Dolar lunged at <span style="">him<i> </i>saying<i>:
</i>"<i>Ang bagal mo,</i>"<i> </i></span>injuring the left thumb of
Danilo in the process.  Irritated, Dolar
pinned down Danilo on the ground with his face down.  He took Danilo's wallet, containing cash in the sum of P270.00,
and his Citizen watch worth P880.00.  Leny was also made to lie <span style="">on </span>the
ground.  A twenty peso bill was taken
from her by Montalbo.  Thereafter,
Danilo and Leny were ordered to lie on the ground with their face <span style="">up.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After Danilo and Leny were divested of their money and jewelry,
accused Montalbo fled towards the squatters' area nearby, leaving behind
Dolar.  Apparently, Dolar had other
sinister intent in mind.  He sat on
Danilo's belly and, with the fan knife poked on Danilo's chest, warned: <i><span style="">"Huwag kang kikilos, ibabaon ko
ito."</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dolar ordered Leny to come nearer.  She obliged.  He asked her
to kiss him and threatened to kill Danilo if she refuse to do so.  Fearful for the life of her boyfriend, she
closed her eyes and allowed accused Dolar to kiss her on the lips.  Dolar pressed her down on the ground beside
Danilo.  With his left hand, he
unbuttoned, unzipped and pulled down Leny's <i><span style="">maong </span></i>pants.  Thereafter, he removed her panty.  He did all these while the knife, which he held with his right hand, was
poked <span style="">on </span>Danilo's chest.  Danilo helplessly watched as Dolar was
touching and biting Leny's private part.  His lust still unsatisfied, Dolar lowered his pants and brief to his
knees, pointed the knife at Leny's throat and then went on top of her.  Dolar cautioned Danilo not to move,
otherwise, he would kill Leny.  Danilo
waited for his chance to escape.  Finally, when accused kneeled to satisfy his lust, Danilo immediately
stood up and ran towards the NAPOCOR building for help.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> While
Danilo was gone, Dolar continued ravishing Leny.  Soon after, he fled towards the squatters' area.</p>

<p class="BODY">After her rapist had left, Leny stood up and put on her panty and
pants.  She was crying as she proceeded
towards the NAPOCOR building.  With the
help of the security guards on duty, the policemen were informed of the
incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">That same evening, policemen from the Western Police District
conducted a saturation drive in the squatters' area.  More or less, fifteen (15) men, including accused Opiniado Dolar
and Reynaldo Montalbo, were gathered by the policemen and brought to Precint
No. 5 of the Western Police District in Manila.  A police line-up was formed.  Without hesitation, Danilo and Leny identified accused Reynaldo Montalbo
and Opiniado Dolar as the culprits.  Thereafter, the sworn statements of Danilo Permison, Leny Reli and one
Miriam Castro, alleged owner of the house where accused were found hiding, were
taken.  It was then twelve thirty in the
morning of October 25, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense was anchored on alibi.  Reynaldo Montalbo, a truck helper and resident of 20th Street,
Bonifacio Drive, Port Area, Manila, averred that on October 24, 1987, he
reported for work from one o'clock until five o'clock in the afternoon.  At around six o'clock in the evening, he
went home.  He was resting on his rented
room, owned by the father of Miriam Castro, when the policemen arrived at eight
thirty in the evening that same day.  The policemen gathered fifteen (15) men from the 20th Street.  Subsequently, he and several other men were
taken to Precint No. 5.  At the station,
a police line-up, consisting of fifteen (15) men, including himself and Dolar
whom he saw for the first time, was formed.  Danilo and Leny identified him and Dolar from the line-up.  He alleged that Leny was merely coached by
Danilo to get even.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Opiniado Dolar asserted that at around five o'clock
in the afternoon of October 24, 1987, he paid a visit to his friend, Reynaldo
Improgo Dumarao, at the latter's residence at 20th Street, Port Area,
Manila.  They talked until nine o'clock
in the evening.  The policemen then
arrived and ordered them to step out of the house.  Fifteen (15) men, including himself and Dumarao, were brought to
the police station.  He denied knowing
Reynaldo Montalbo.  He and Montalbo
were, thereafter, identified from the police line-up by Danilo Permison.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witness Reynaldo Improgo Dumarao corroborated the
testimony of his friend, Opiniado Dolar, that the latter visited him between
four thirty and five o'clock in the afternoon of October 24, 1987.  It was alleged that on October 24, 1987,
Dolar had just arrived in Manila, from their hometown Bacolod.  They engaged in conversation.  At around nine o'clock in the evening, the
policemen came.  The policemen brought
fifteen (15) men to the precint.  After
Dolar and Montalbo were identified from the police line-up, they (accused Dolar
and Montalbo) were jailed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Decision, dated August 15, 1989, the trial court found
accused Dolar and Montalbo guilty as charged of robbery.  The trial court, however, ruled that there
was no conspiracy to commit the crime of rape.  The dispositive portion of trial court's decision, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Prosecution having proven beyond reasonable
doubt the guilt of the accused Opiniado Dolar y Evalla of the crime of robbery
with rape, sentences him to suffer the penalty of Life Imprisonment; to pay
Danilo Permison the sum of One Thousand one Hundred Fifty (P1,150.00) as
damages, and to pay Leny Reli the sum of Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos as
damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused Reynaldo Montalbo y Gutierrez is likewise found
guilty beyond reasonable doubt not of the crime of robbery with rape, but only
a simple robbery, and sentences him to suffer the penalty of FOUR (4) YEARS,
TWO (2) MONTHS, and ONE (1) DAY to SIX (6) YEARS IMPRISONMENT; to pay Leny the
sum of One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos as damages, he is entitled to the full
term he was under detention.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"SO ORDERED."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused Reynaldo Montalbo did not appeal from the foregoing
judgment.  On February 1, 1990, he was
granted a six-year probation by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Opiniado Dolar appealed, raising this error:</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING
ACCUSED-APPELLANT OPINIADO DOLAR GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF
ROBBERY WITH RAPE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are aware of the trial court's difficult task of weighing the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses <i><span style="">vis-a-vis
</span></i>the testimony of defense witnesses, particularly in rape cases.  The issue, thus, boils down to the
credibility of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, two (2) prosecution witnesses, Danilo
Permison and Leny Rely, positively identified accused-appellant Dolar as the
hold-upper and the rapist.  Danilo
Permison testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL DELOS REYES;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court's finding that Danilo and Leny told
the truth when they testified in open court.  Their testimonies are not only consistent in all material aspects, they
are also replete with minutiae of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no cogent reason for us to depart from the established
doctrine that the findings of the trial court pertaining to the credibility of
witnesses deserve great respect since it had the opportunity to observe the
demeanor of the witnesses as they testified on the witness stand and,
therefore, it could discern if the witnesses had told the truth or not.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant contends that it was not possible for Danilo
and Leny to recognize the culprits since the place of incident was dark.  He further alleges that Bonifacio Drive is
not a busy street, particularly at night, and very few cars pass by to
illuminate the area.  This argument is
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that the Napocor building, some thirty meters from the
place of incident, was lighted at the time Danilo and Leny were held up.  Accused-appellant was seen at close range by
Danilo and Leny before they were dragged.  Further, Danilo and Leny testified that the light from the passing
vehicles illuminated the area, thus, they managed to recognize the
culprits.  The identification of
accused-appellant, a few hours after the incident, bolstered the allegations of
Danilo and Leny on Dolar's participation in the crime.  Judging from their testimonies in open court,
Danilo and Leny had retained their senses despite the horrible experience they
had gone through.  Thus, we held:
"It is the most natural reaction for victims of criminal violence to
strive to see the looks and faces of their assailants and observe the manner in
which the crime was committed.  Most
often the face of the assailant and body movements thereof, create a lasting
impression which cannot be easily erased from their memory."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

his testimony and that of his childhood friend, Reynaldo Dumarao.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alibi is a weak defense, particularly, when it is not physically
impossible for accused to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its
commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bench, accused-appellant was at his friend's house, some eight
meters away from the place of the incident.  He was arrested at nine o'clock, or thirty minutes after the robbery and
rape had been committed.  It was, thus,
not impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">All things considered, we hold that Opiniado Dolar is guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with rape.  We note, however, that the trial court erred
in sentencing him to life imprisonment.  The penalty for Robbery with Rape, pursuant to Article 294 (2) of the
Revised Penal Code, is <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death.  The penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua </i>is
not synonymous with life imprisonment as the former entails imprisonment for at
least thirty (30) years and carries with it accessory penalties, whereas, the
latter has no definite duration and does not carry any accessory penalty.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the appealed decision is
AFFIRMED WITH MODIFICATION that accused-appellant Opiniado Dolar is meted the
penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua.  </i>Considering
the perversity of the accused-appellant, the civil indemnity in favor of Leny
Reli is increased to forty thousand pesos (P40,000.00).<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
