<p>Petitioner seeks the review of the decision of the Intermediate Appellate 
Court dated April 30, 1985 reversing the order of the Court of First Instance of 
Camarines Sur, Branch VI, dated August 21, 1980, which dismissed the complaint 
of respondent Pablo Feliciano for recovery of ownership and possession of a 
parcel of land on the ground of non-suability of the State.<br><br>The 
background of the present controversy may be briefly summarized as 
follows:<br><br>On January 22, 1970, respondent Feliciano filed a complaint with 
the then Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur against the Republic of the 
Philippines, represented by the Land Authority, for the recovery of ownership 
and possession of a parcel of land, consisting of four (4) lots with an 
aggregate area of 1,364.4177 hectares, situated in the Barrio of Salvacion, 
Municipality of Tinambac, Camarines Sur.&nbsp; Plaintiff alleged that he bought the 
property in question from Victor Gardiola by virtue of a Contract of Sale dated 
May 31, 1952, followed by a Deed of Absolute Sale on October 30, 1954; that 
Gardiola had acquired the property by purchase from the heirs of Francisco 
Abrazado whose title to the said property was evidenced by an 
<em><em>informacion posesoria</em></em>; that upon plaintiff's purchase of the 
property, he took actual possession of the same, introduced various improvements 
therein and caused it to be surveyed in July 1952, which survey was approved by 
the Director of Lands on October 24, 1954; that on November 1, 1954, President 
Ramon Magsaysay issued Proclamation No. 90 reserving for settlement purposes, 
under the administration of the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation 
Administration (NARRA), a tract of land situated in the Municipalities of 
Tinambac and Siruma, Camarines Sur, after which the NARRA and its successor 
agency, the Land Authority, started subdividing and distributing the land to the 
settlers; that the property in question, while located within the reservation 
established under Proclamation No. 90, was the private property of plaintiff and 
should therefore be excluded therefrom.&nbsp; Plaintiff prayed that he be declared 
the rightful and true owner of the property in question consisting of 1,364.4177 
hectares; that his title of ownership based on <em><em>informacion 
posesoria</em> </em>of his predecessorin-interest be declared legal, valid and 
subsisting and that defendant be ordered to cancel and nullify all awards to the 
settlers.<br><br>The defendant, represented by the Land Authority, filed an 
answer, raising by way of affirmative defenses lack of sufficient cause of 
action and prescription.<br><br>On August 29, 1970, the trial court, through 
Judge Rafael S. Sison, rendered a decision declaring Lot No. 1, with an area of 
701.9064 hectares, to be the private property of the plaintiff, "being covered 
by a possessory information title in the name of his predecessor-in-interest" 
and declaring said lot excluded from the NARRA settlement reservation.&nbsp; The 
court declared the rest of the property claimed by plaintiff, <em>i.e.</em> Lots 
2, 3 and 4, reverted to the public domain.<br><br>A motion to intervene and to 
set aside the decision of August 29, 1970 was filed by eighty-six (86) settlers, 
together with the barrio council of Pag-asay, alleging among other things that 
intervenors had been in possession of the land in question for more than twenty 
(20) years under claim of ownership.<br><br>On January 25, 1971, the court 
<em><em>a quo</em></em> reconsidered its decision, reopened the case and 
directed the intervenors to file their corresponding pleadings and present their 
evidence; all evidence already presented were to remain but plaintiff, as well 
as the Republic of the Philippines, could present additional evidence if they so 
desire.&nbsp; The plaintiff presented additional evidence on July 30, 1971, and the 
case was set for hearing for the reception of intervenorsâ€™ evidence on August 30 
and August 31, 1971.<br><br>On August 30, 1971, the date set for the 
presentation of the evidence for intervenors, the latter did not appear but 
submitted a motion for postponement and resetting of the hearing on the next 
day, August 31, 1971.&nbsp; The trial court denied the motion for postponement and 
allowed plaintiff to offer his evidence "<em>en ausencia</em>", after which the 
case would be deemed submitted for decision.&nbsp; On the following day, August 31, 
1971, Judge Sison rendered a decision reiterating his decision of August 29, 
1970.<br><br>A motion for reconsideration was immediately filed by the 
intervenors.&nbsp; But before this motion was acted upon, plaintiff filed a motion 
for execution, dated November 18, 1971.&nbsp; On December 10, 1971, the lower court, 
this time through Judge Miguel Navarro, issued an order denying the motion for 
execution and setting aside the order denying intervenors' motion for 
postponement.&nbsp; The case was reopened to allow intervenors to present their 
evidence.&nbsp; Unable to secure a reconsideration of Judge Navarro's order, the 
plaintiff went to the Intermediate Appellate Court on a petition for 
<em><em>certiorari</em></em>.&nbsp; Said petition was, however, denied by the 
Intermediate Appellate Court, and petitioners brought the matter to this Court 
in G.R. No. 36163, which was denied on May 3, 1973.&nbsp; Consequently, the case was 
remanded to the court <em><em>a quo</em></em> for further proceedings.<br><br>On 
August 31, 1970, intervenors filed a motion to dismiss, principally on the 
ground that the Republic of the Philippines cannot be sued without its consent 
and hence the action cannot prosper.&nbsp; The motion was opposed by the 
plaintiff.<br><br>On August 21, 1980, the trial court, through Judge Esteban 
Lising, issued the questioned order dismissing the case for lack of 
jurisdiction.&nbsp; Respondent moved for reconsideration, while the Solicitor 
General, on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines filed its opposition 
thereto, maintaining that the dismissal was proper on the ground of 
non-suability of the State and also on the ground that the existence and/or 
authenticity of the purported possessory information title of the respondents' 
predecessor-in-interest had not been demonstrated and that at any rate, the same 
is not evidence of title, or if it is, its efficacy has been lost by 
prescription and laches.<br><br>Upon denial of the motion for reconsideration, 
plaintiff again went to the Intermediate Appellate Court on petition for 
<em><em>certiorari</em></em>.&nbsp; On April 30, 1985, the respondent appellate court 
rendered its decision reversing the order of Judge Lising and remanding the case 
to the court <em><em>a quo</em></em> for further proceedings.&nbsp; Hence this 
petition.<br><br>We find the petition meritorious.&nbsp; The doctrine of 
non-suability of the State has proper application in this case.&nbsp; The plaintiff 
has impleaded the Republic of the Philippines as defendant in an action for 
recovery of ownership and possession of a parcel of land, bringing the State to 
court just like any private person who is claimed to be usurping a piece of 
property.&nbsp; A suit for the recovery of property is not an action <em>in rem,</em> 
but an action <em>in personam</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> It 
is an action directed against a specific party or parties, and any judgment 
therein binds only such party or parties.&nbsp; The complaint filed by plaintiff, the 
private respondent herein, is directed against the Republic of the Philippines, 
represented by the Land Authority, a governmental agency created by Republic Act 
No. 3844.<br><br>By its caption and its allegation and prayer, the complaint is 
clearly a suit against the State, which under settled jurisprudence is not 
permitted, except upon a showing that the State has consented to be sued, either 
expressly or by implication through the use of statutory language too plain to 
be misinterpreted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> There is no such 
showing in the instant case.&nbsp; Worse, the complaint itself fails to allege the 
existence of such consent.&nbsp; This is a fatal defect,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and on this basis alone, the complaint 
should have been dismissed.<br><br>The failure of the petitioner to assert the 
defense of immunity from suit when the case was tried before the court <em><em>a 
quo</em></em>, as alleged by private respondent, is not fatal.&nbsp; It is now 
settled that such defense "may be invoked by the courts sua sponte at any stage 
of the proceedings."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Private 
respondent contends that the consent of petitioner may be read from the 
Proclamation itself, when it established the reservation "subject to private 
rights, if any there be." We do not agree.&nbsp; No such consent can be drawn from 
the language of the Proclamation.&nbsp; The exclusion of existing private rights from 
the reservation established by Proclamation No. 90 can not be construed as a 
waiver of the immunity of the State from suit.&nbsp; Waiver of immunity, being a 
derogation of sovereignty, will not be inferred lightly, but must be construed 
in <em>strictissimi juris</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
Moreover, the Proclamation is not a legislative act.&nbsp; The consent of the State 
to be sued must emanate from statutory authority.&nbsp; Waiver of State immunity can 
only be made by an act of the legislative body.<br><br>Neither is there merit in 
respondent's submission, which the respondent appellate court sustained, on the 
basis of our decision in the <em>Begosa</em> case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> that the present action is not a suit 
against the State within the rule of State immunity from suit, because plaintiff 
does not seek to divest the Government of any of its lands or its funds.&nbsp; It is 
contended that the complaint involves land not owned by the State, but private 
land belonging to the plaintiff, hence the Government is not being divested of 
any of its properties.&nbsp; There is some sophistry involved in this argument, since 
the character of the land sought to be recovered still remains to be 
established, and the plaintiff's action is directed against the State precisely 
to compel the latter to litigate the ownership and possession of the property.&nbsp; 
In other words, the plaintiff is out to establish that he is the owner of the 
land in question based, incidentally, on an <em><em>informacion 
posesoria</em></em> of dubious value, and he seeks to establish his claim of 
ownership by suing the Republic of the Philippines in an action <em>in 
personam</em>.<br><br>The inscription in the property registry of an 
<em>informacion posesoria</em> under the Spanish Mortgage Law was a means 
provided by the law then in force in the Philippines prior to the transfer of 
sovereignty from Spain to the United States of America, to record a claimant's 
actual possession of a piece of land, established through an <em>ex parte</em> 
proceeding conducted in accordance with prescribed rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Such inscription merely furnishes, at 
best, <em>prima facie</em> evidence of the fact that at the time the proceeding 
was held, the claimant was in possession of the land under a claim of right as 
set forth in his application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The 
possessory information could ripen into a record of ownership after the lapse of 
20 years (later reduced to 10 years), upon the fulfillment of the requisites 
prescribed in Article 393 of the Spanish Mortgage Law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>There is no showing in the case at 
bar that the <em>informacion posesoria</em> held by the respondent had been 
converted into a record of ownership.&nbsp; Such possessory information, therefore, 
remained at best mere prima facie evidence of possession.&nbsp; Using this possessory 
information, the respondent could have applied for judicial confirmation of 
imperfect title under the Public Land Act, which is an action <em>in rem</em>.&nbsp; 
However, having failed to do so, it is rather late for him to pursue this avenue 
at this time.&nbsp; Respondent must also contend, as the records disclose, with the 
fact admitted by him and stated in the decision of the Court <em><em>a 
quo</em></em>, that settlers have been occupying and cultivating the land in 
question since even before the outbreak of the war, which puts in grave doubt 
his own claim of possession.<br><br>Worthy of note is the fact, as pointed out 
by the Solicitor General, that the <em>informacion posesoria</em> registered in 
the Office of the Register of Deed of Camarines Sur on September 23, 1952 was a 
"reconstituted" possessory information; it was "reconstituted from the duplicate 
presented to this office (Register of Deeds) by Dr. Pablo Feliciano," without 
the submission of proof that the alleged duplicate was authentic or that the 
original thereof was lost.&nbsp; Reconstitution can be validly made only in case of 
loss of the original.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> These 
circumstances raise grave doubts as to the authenticity and validity of the 
"<em>informacion posesoria</em>" relied upon by respondent Feliciano.&nbsp; Adding to 
the dubiousness of said document is the fact that "possessory information calls 
for an area of only 100 hectares,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
whereas the land claimed by respondent Feliciano comprises 1,364.4177 hectares, 
later reduced to 701.9064 hectares.&nbsp; Courts should be wary in accepting 
"possessory information" documents, as well as other purportedly old Spanish 
titles, as proof of alleged ownership of 
lands.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, judgment is hereby rendered reversing 
and setting aside the appealed decision of the Intermediate Appellate Court, 
dated April 30, 1985, and affirming the order of the court <em><em>a 
quo</em></em>, dated August 21, 1980, dismissing the complaint filed by 
respondent Pablo Feliciano against the Republic of the Philippines.&nbsp; No 
costs.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>. </p>
