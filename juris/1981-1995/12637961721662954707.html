Francisca Cardente, for and on behalf of her grandson, petitioner Ignacio
Cardente, who was then a minor, and now married to his co-petitioner, purchased
from Isidro Palanay one hectare of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The property purchased is a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">part
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of a 9.2656-hectare parcel of
land covered by Original Certificate of Title (O.C.T., for short) No. P-1380 in
Palanay's name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately after the
purchase, the Cardentes took possession of the land and planted various crops
and trees thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They have been in
continuous possession ever since, adverse to the whole world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, however, the private document
evidencing the sale of the one-hectare lot to petitioner Ignacio Cardente was
lost and never found despite diligent efforts exerted to locate the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Isidro Palanay sold the entire property covered by O.C.T. No. P-1380, including
the one-hectare portion already sold to Cardente, this time to the private
respondents, Ruperto Rubin and his wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The deed of sale was registered and a new title, Transfer Certificate of
Title (T.C.T., for short) No. 1173, was issued in favor of the Rubin
spouses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the second
sale, or because of it, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Isidro

complaint for arson with the P.C.-Integrated National Police at Malaybalay,
Bukidnon, against Ruperto Rubin, whom they suspected of having committed the
crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, in retaliation, on
March 31, 1977, seventeen long years after their purchase, the private
respondents filed a complaint with the then Court of First Instance of Bukidnon
for quieting of title with damages, against the petitioners, claiming ownership
over the whole property previously covered by O.C.T. No. P-1380, now registered
in their names under T.C.T. No. 1173.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

subsequently registered their title thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By reason of such bad faith, the petitioners' claim that insofar as the
controverted one-hectare parcel of land is concerned the private respondents'
title thereto is null and void.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>We grant the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Admittedly, this case
involves a double sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the
private respondents allegedly bought from Isidro Palanay on August 18, 1960 the
entire property comprising 9.2656 hectares and covered by O.C.T. No. P-1380,
the petitioners, on the other hand, lay claim to one hectare thereof which they
undeniably purchased from the same vendor earlier, in 1956.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The conflict, therefore, falls under, and can
be resolved by, Article 1544 of the Civil </span>Code which sets the rules on
double sales.</p>

<blockquote>ART. 1544.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the same thing
should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership shall be transferred
to the person who may have first taken possession thereof in good faith, if it
should be movable property.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Should it be immovable property, the ownership shall belong to
the person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of
Property</b>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain to
the person who in good faith was first in the possession; and, in the absence
thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good
faith.<o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is undisputed that the
private respondents, the second vendees, registered the sale in their favor
whereas the petitioners, the first buyers, did not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But mere registration of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sale </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">is not enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Good faith must
concur with the registration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bad faith
renders the </span>registration nothing but an exercise in futility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law and jurisprudence are very clear on
this score.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The heart of the problem
is whether or not the private respondents acted in good faith when they
registered the deed of sale dated August 18, 1960 more than </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">six </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the knowledge, or lack of it, of the previous sale of the one-hectare portion
on the part of the second buyers at the time of registration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found that the second vendees
had such knowledge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">It </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is true that good faith is always presumed
