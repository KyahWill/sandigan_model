Shirley <span class="SpellE">Cuyugan-Lizaso</span> filed a sworn Complaint for
disbarment against respondent Atty. Sergio G. <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>
charging the latter with deceitful and grossly immoral conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court required respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> to file an Answer to the complaint, and respondent
did so on <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="5">25 May 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <span style="">Reply
</span>dated <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="9">23 September 1980</st1:date>
was filed by complainant.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="11">10
 November 1980</st1:date>, the Court referred this case to the Office of the
Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 18 June 1981, complainant wrote a letter to this Court
requesting an order restraining respondent from leaving the country and an
order restraining respondent's employer the University of the East; from
disbursing monies that may be due to respondent on account of his retirement
from the University's service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
referred this request to the Office of the Solicitor General in a Resolution
dated <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="7">15 <span style="">July </span>1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor General accordingly held hearings at
which the complainant appeared and testified on her own behalf and submitted
documentary evidence to support her allegations of misconduct on the part of
the respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>
appeared at these hearings, testified on his own behalf and was
cross–examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent also
presented documentary evidence on his behalf, but failed to complete his
presentation of evidence despite repeated notices to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>
failed to offer formally his documentary evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant's case was summarized by the Solicitor General in
his Report and Recommendation dated <st1:date year="1990" day="7" month="2">7
 February 1990</st1:date> <span style="">in </span>the
following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"On August 7, 1978, complainant handed to respondent
Prudential Bank Check No. 655615 dated August 4,1978 in the amount of P5,000.00
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘A’) payable to the latter and which, per
agreement between the two of them, was to be invested in respondent's business
venture in the casino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was
enticed into investing in the business by respondent's proposition that the
business will guarantee her an interest of 10% percent <span style="">p</span>rofit a da<span style="">y</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was further convinced because she
knows of her sister's friend who deals in the same business in the casino and
who even accepts jewelries from gamblers who have lost heavily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The check was <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>
by respondent as shown by his signature appearing at the back of the check.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A written receipt (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B') for the
amount of P5,000.00 was signed by respondent on <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1978</st1:date> and which states:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Mrs. Shirley <span class="SpellE">Cuyugan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lizaso</span>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 0in 0.6in 0.0001pt 7.1in; text-indent: 6.3pt;">(signed)’</p>

<blockquote>The complainant originally prepared the check and the receipt on <st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to seek respondent's signature on
the receipt but it w<span style="">as </span>only on <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="8">August 7,<i><span style="">
 </span></i>1978</st1:date>, when she was able to see respondent and gave to
him the P5,000.00 check for which respondent si<span style="">g</span>ned the receipt/ promissory note.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Three days after <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="8">August <i><span style="">7, </span></i>1978</st1:date>, complainant
tried to see respondent in order to collect the interest on her investment but
respondent failed to give her any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the many weeks that followed, com<span style="">p</span>lainant
even begged respondent to return her money if he could not give the interests
but respondent merely made promises.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Afraid that her investment will not be returned, complainant sought
the help of the UE Legal Department Head, Atty. Pedro <span class="SpellE">Siojo</span>
and presented her written complaint dated <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1978</st1:date> against respondent (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'C').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Siojo</span>
scheduled a confrontation but the respondent failed to come.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second scheduled confrontation likewise
resulted in respondent's failure to appear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of these, Att<span style="">y</span>. <span class="SpellE">Siojo</span> informed her that he<b> </b>cannot do anything if
respondent refuses to appear.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Because of this, complainant sought the help of Mr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ravelo</span>, UE Faculty President, but the latter was not able
to help her because respondent denied that he ever owed complainant anything.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Again, complainant sought the help of the University President, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, by her letter of <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'D').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, however, was of the opinion that this was a
personal agreement best left between the two of them to settle.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> presented a different
version of the facts, which was substantially as follows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in June 1978, complainant allegedly
approached respondent for a loan of P20,000.00 needed <span style="">to forestall </span>foreclosure of a mortgage on complainant's
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>
allegedly lent P5,000.00 to complainant, which loan fell due a month
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was allegedly very
slow in repaying the loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To provide
complainant with an incentive for repaying her loan from the respondent, the
latter dangled the possibility of a second loan of P20,000.00 to complainant,
upon complainant's repayment of her first loan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="8">7 August 1978</st1:date>,
complainant tendered to respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> the
P5,000.00 check referred to in the <span style="">complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Amante</span> <span style="">admitted </span>he <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>
the check, but argued that he did so to realize <span style="">the </span>payment of complainant's prior obligation to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent said he had no real intention of
extending a second loan to complainant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This outraged the complainant and she allegedly then tried to extort
money from respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> by harassing him with
her false and fabricated complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent also denied having signed the receipt for P5,
000.00 with the wording appealing in <span style="">Exhibit
</span>"B" of the Complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, to substantiate his own version of the evidence,
respondent offered in evidence Exhibits "1" and "2" being a
copy of a receipt for <span style="">P5,000.00
allegedly</span> given in payment of complainant’s loan from respondent, and
purportedly signed by complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>After careful examination
of the records of this case, <span style="">we agree
with the Solicitor General that complainant has discharged the burden of
showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that she had delivered P5,000.00 to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> for investment purposes and that
respondent not only failed to deliver the promised return on the investment but
also the principal thereof, despite repeated demands <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasoning and conclusions of fact of the
Solicitor General follow:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>First</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most
persuasive in lending credence to this is the fact that the check, at the time of
encashment by respondent, already contained the words ‘capital investment’ at
the back thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank's microfilm
copy of the reverse side of the check confirms it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This amply and clearly substantiate the
material fact that at the time the check was received by respondent and
presented by him <span style="">to </span>the bank, the
agreement between him and complainant was to invest the amount <span style="">in </span>respondent's business venture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It totally negates respondent's claim that
the check was in payment of a previous loan given by him to complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Second</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receipt/promissory note (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘B’ dated August 7, 1978 clearly expresses the terms
of their oral agreement that the amount of P5,000.00 was entrusted to
respondent to be invested by him in his business venture, that said amount has
a guarantee of 10% profit per day starting August 7, 1978, and that the capital
of <span style="">P5,000.00 </span>shall be returned
to complainant after two months from date thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said receipt unquestionably bears the
signature of respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To all these
terms, respondent affixed his signature.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Third</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
complainant had repeatedly demanded the return of her P5,000.00 capital
investment which respondent failed to do, the latter wrote a note dated <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1978</st1:date> addressed to a
certain Mr. <span class="SpellE">Resty</span> Noriega (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'H') authorizing complainant to collect in his (respondent's) behalf his fee
from Mr. Noriega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant presented
this note to Mr. Noriega who informed her that the note is not clear enough to
entrust complainant with payment of respondent's fee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Noriega then returned the note to her
with the advice that she should secure <span style="">a<i>
</i></span>letter from respondent to specify the amount to be collected by
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's note does show
an admission of his obligation to return or reimburse complainant's money.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Fourth</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tenacity
and resourcefulness <span style="">with which </span>complainant
repeatedly sought help from various school officials such as the UE Head of
Legal Department, the UE Faculty President and the University President
himself, in separate written complaints, prior to finally securing legal
assistance from a private lawyer, all directed to seeking the return or
reimbursement of her P5,000.00 investment, are evincive of the credibility and
faithfulness to the truth of complainant's cause of action against
respondent."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the Solicitor General found <span style="">respondent's version of the facts to be

<span style="">exhibits submitted by respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> a</span>pp<span style="">eared

P5,000.00 was received by respondent as her capital to be invested in
respondent's business venture with a guarantee of 10% net profit a day starting
August 7, 1978 and the same to be returned two months thereafter; and that
complainant allegedly cut off all the wordings of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

affix his signature so far away below from the handwritten words, leaving a big
void or vacant space in between which any ordinary layman knows may be used to
another's advantage and manipulated to the Prejudice of the signatory, even
more <span style="">so </span>that respondent is a<i> </i>lawyer.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Furthermore, a comparison
of the edge of the cut top portion of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B' with
the last handwritten line in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '1' which consisted
of </span>only one word 'loan' would readily show that the handwritten loops
appearing on the edge of the cut portion of the top of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'B' do not, at all, correspond to the last line of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'1', which does not contain any tail loops at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the last line of respondent's
<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '1' containing the handwritten word ‘loan’ does
not have any tail loops that <span style="">would </span>correspond

believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately clear, therefore,
is the conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '1' and 'B' are not the
same and are far different from each other.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lastly, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '1', just like Annex '1'
(stub receipt), had never been presented by respondent in any of the
confrontations set by the university officials between complainant and respondent,
but <span style="">was only presented during the
investigation at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">3. Respondent's claim that he enticed
complainant to pay him the alleged P5,000.00 loan/earlier gave to her, by
promising to give her P20,000.00 if she pays the P5,000.00 loan, is quite hollow
and very unlikely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person, the
complainant </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">less, who knows that she will be given a
P20,000.00 loan would very unlikely pay </span>a previous loan of P5,000.00 but
would merely partially offset said amount and received instead the balance of
P15,000.00</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, <span style="">it must be
remembered that complainant secured from the Prudential Bank a loan of
P5,000.00 on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="8"><span style="">August 4, 1978</span></st1:date><span style=""> in order to invest it on respondent's
business venture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To follow respondent's
twisted reasoning, it evokes wonder why complainant would secure a P5,000.00 </span>loan
from the bank just to pay a P5,000.00 loan to respondent who promised to give
her, anyway, a P20,000.00 loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
complainant really needed the balance of P15,000.00, she could have very well
secured the same from the bank and not from the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there was no necessity for
complainant to obtain a subsequent loan from respondent because she could just
as well, get the same loan from the bank as she was able to.</blockquote>

as the respondent is, it appears strange that he has not required complainant

June, 1978.' If complainant, who is not a lawyer, was able to make him sign a<i>

accounting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also appears that when
finally brought before the Office of the Solicitor General in the disbarment

controvert complainant's charges by using in evidence documents that appear to

<p class="BODY">It is true, of course, that there was no attorney-client

the principle that it can exercise its power to discipline lawyers for causes
which do not involve the relationship of an attorney and client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, a member of the Bar, was appointed guardian of a
minor child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such guardian, he came
into possession of certain property, including some shares of stock in certain
corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>,
<span style="">while </span>still guardian of the
minor, borrowed money from the Philippine National Bank and to guarantee that
personal loan, <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span>, without the knowledge<span style=""> </span>or consent of the guardianship court,
pledged the shares of stock belonging to the minor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In disciplining the respondent, Mr. Justice
Malcolm said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
[A]s a general rule, a court will not assume jurisdiction to discipline one of
its officers for misconduct alleged to have been committed in his private
capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>But this is a<i> </i>general
rule with many exceptions</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
courts sometimes stress the point that <u>the attorney has shown, through
misconduct outside of his professional dealings, a<i> </i>want of such
professional honesty as render him unworthy of public confidence, and an unfit
and unsafe person to manage the legal business of others</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason why such a distinction can be
drawn is because it is the court which admits an attorney<span style=""> </span>to the bar, and the court requires for
such admission the possession of a good moral character.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The nature of the office, the trust relation which exists between
attorney and client, as well as between court and attorney, and the statutory
rule prescribing the qualifications of attorneys, uniformly <u>require that an
attorney shall be a good moral character<i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></i>If that qualification is a condition precedent to a license or
privilege to enter upon the practice of the law, it would seem to be equally
essential during the continuance of the practice and the exercise of the
privilege</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it is held that <u>an
attorney will be removed not only for malpractice and dishonesty in his
profession, but also for gross misconduct not connected with his professional
duties, which shows him to be unfit for the office and unworthy of the
privileges which his license and the law confer upon him</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rationale of the rule that misconduct, indicative of moral
unfitness, whether relating to professional or non-professional matters,
justifies suspension or disbarment, was expressed by Mr. Chief Justice Prentice
in <span class="SpellE"><u>In</u></span><u> Re Disbarment of Peck</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
with eloquence and restraint:</p>

<blockquote>"As important as it is that an attorney be competent to deal
with the oftentimes intricate matters which may be <span class="SpellE">intrusted</span>
to him, <u>it is infinitely more so that he be upright and trust­worthy</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, it is not easy to limit
membership <span style="">in </span>the profession to
those who satisfy the standard test of fitness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But scant progress in that direction can be hoped for if in the
determination of the qualification of professional fitness, non-professional
dishonor and dishonesty in whatsoever path of life is to be ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Professional honesty and honor are not to
be expected as<i> </i>the accompaniment of dishonesty and dishonor in other
relations</u>. <u><span style="">&nbsp;</span>So it is that we</u>,
in common with other courts, <u>hold, as<i> </i>did Lord Mansfield more than a
century ago, that </u><u><span style="">misconduct,
indicative of moral unfitness for the profession, whether it be professional or
non-professional, justifies <span class="SpellE">dismission</span> as well </span>as
exclusion</u><u><span style=""> from the bar</span></u><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (Emphases supplied)</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rule in this jurisdiction was stated by Mr. Justice Malcolm
in <u>Piatt v. <span class="SpellE">Abordo</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
in the following terms:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that an attorney
may be removed or otherwise disciplined "not only for malpractice and dishonesty
in his profession, but also for gross misconduct not connected with <span style="">his </span>professional duties, which showed
him to be unfit for the office and unworthy of the privileges which his license
and the law confer to him." Mr. Justice Malcolm went on to say:</p>

<blockquote>"The courts are not curators of the morals of the bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time the profession is not
compelled to harbor all persons whatever their character, who are fortunate
enough to keep out of prison.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As good
character is an essential <span style="">q</span>ualification
for admission of an attorney to practice, when the attorney's character is bad
in such respects as to show that he is unsafe and unfit to be entrusted with
the powers of an attorney, the courts retain the power to discipline him."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we should refer to Rule <span style="">101 </span>set out in Chapter I entitled "The Lawyer and Societ<span style="">y</span>" of the "Code of
Professional Responsibility" which requires that "a lawyer shall not
engage in unlawful <u>dishonest, immoral or deceitful</u> conduct." We
emphasize here that "conduct," as used in this <span style="">rule, is not limited to conduct exhibited in
connection with the performance of professional duties.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, it is
clear to the Court that the conduct </span>of <span style="">respondent <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> in failing to account for

complainant, constituted dishonest and immoral conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are compelled to conclude that respondent
attorney converted complainant's monies to his personal uses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This dishonest conduct was compounded by the
efforts of respondent attorney to deny and dissimulate the transaction that he
had entered into with complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As </span><span style="">far </span><span style="">as the records of this case show, respondent has not to date returned
