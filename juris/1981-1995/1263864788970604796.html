the first rig was approaching her, but as appellant's vehicle was going so fast
not only because of the steep down-grade of the road, but also because he was
trying to overtake the rig ahead of him, the appellant's rig bumped the old
woman, who as a consequence fell at the middle of the road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant continued to drive on, but a
by-stander, one Vicente <span class="SpellE">Nangyao</span>, who had just closed
his store in the market in order to celebrate the coming of the New Year, and
who saw the incident right before him, shouted at the appellant to stop.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He ran after appellant when the latter
refused to stop.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Overtaking the
appellant, <span class="SpellE">Nangyao</span> asked him why he bumped the old
woman and his answer was, </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">'it </span>was
the old woman that bumped him.’ The appellant went back to the place where the
old woman was struck by his rig.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The old
woman was unconscious, and the food and viands she was carrying were scattered

not to exceed 1/3 of the principal penalty and to pay the costs" (p. 3,
Appellant's Brief, p. 56, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R.
09949-CR) which, on October 10, 1974, affirmed the conviction of the accused
but increased his civil liability to P12,000.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">After his motion for reconsideration of the Court of Appeals'
decision was denied, he filed a petition for review in this Court, alleging
that the Court of Appeals erred:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. <span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>in not finding that the
reckless negligence of the victim was the proximate cause of the accident which
led to her death;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
not acquitting the petitioner on the ground of reasonable doubt; and</p>

<p class="NUM">3. in unjustly increasing the civil liability of the petitioner
from P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P12,000.00, although the
circumstances of the victim and the accused (petitioner) do not warrant such
increase.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite evident that all the issues raised in the petition
for review are factual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well-entrenched
in our jurisprudence is the rule that findings of fact of the trial court and
the Court of Appeals are binding upon us (Bernardo vs. Bernardo, 101 SCRA 351; <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">De <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Roxas</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> vs. </span>IAC, 143 SCRA 77; Republic vs. IAC, 144 SCRA 705).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged contributory negligence of the victim, if any, does
not exonerate the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"The
defense of contributory negligence does not apply in criminal cases committed
through reckless imprudence, since one cannot allege the negligence of another
to evade the effects of his own negligence (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Orbeta</span>,
CA-G.R. No. 321, March 29, 1947)." (People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">vs. <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>, <span class="GramE">44 O.G. 1520</span>).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's contention that the Court of Appeals unjustly
increased his civil liability to P12<span class="GramE">,000</span>, is devoid of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">prevailing </span>jurisprudence in fact provides that indemnity for
death in homicide or murder is P30<span class="GramE">,000</span> (People vs. De
la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span>, [1983] 126 SCRA 518; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span> 130 SCRA 198).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the civil liability of the petitioner is increased to P30<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a</span>ffirmed with modification as to the
civil liability of the petitioner which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is
</span>hereby increased to P30<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against petitioner.</span></p>
