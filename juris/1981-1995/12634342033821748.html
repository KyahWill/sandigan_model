<p class="BODY">The People's version of the facts of the case as summarized by
the Solicitor General is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Arlyn Barredo-Jimenez, her two children, Annabelle and
Samuel, Jr., aged five and three, respectively, and her mother, are residents
of 2008 F. Muñoz St., Paco, Manila.  At
about 9:00 p.m. of March 19, 1989, as she was about to eat supper, she noticed
appellant standing five steps away from the open door of her house and holding
a sumpak, a homemade shotgun.  Seized
with fear, she closed the door.  After a
few moments, she heard a burst of gunfire.  This was followed by cries of pain from her children inside the house.  Seeing her children bloodied, she
immediately went outside and shouted for help.  As she did so, she saw appellant running away, carrying the sumpak.  Two neighbors assisted Jimenez in bringing
the injured children to the Philippine General Hospital (tsn, pp. 2-5, 8, 17,
Aug. 7, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That same evening, Patrolman Renato Marquez, a homicide
investigator, interviewed Jimenez at the hospital about the shooting
incident.  Since she was still
experiencing shock over the incident, Jimenez forgot to mention the name of
appellant as the one who shot her children (tsn, pp. 4, 14, Aug. 21, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Acting on the report of a barangay tanod, Patrolmen Roberto
Cajiles, Romeo de la Peña and Carlos Castañeda, assigned at the Ong Detachment,
Police Station No. 5, conducted an investigation of the shooting incident in
the house of Jimenez.  At the time,
Jimenez and her injured children were already in the hospital.  Nevertheless, Pat. Cajiles was able to
interview the mother of Jimenez, the barangay captain, a certain Josie, and
appellant's brother, Rolando, who all mentioned appellant as the
gunwielder.  Moreover, the policemen
discovered the presence of six pellet holes and one big hole with the size of
the circumference of a shotgun bullet on the door of the house of Jimenez.  Three pellets were also found at the crime
scene (tsn. pp. 3-6; 9, 10, Sept. 4, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Early next morning, the three policemen were led by Rolando
Valencia to the residence of Sonia Castillo, his aunt, where he believed
appellant was sleeping.  The police
apprehended appellant there and took him to the Ong Detachment for initial
investigation (tsn, pp. 7, 11<span style="">-</span>13,
Sept. 4, 1989).  He was indorsed to the
police headquarters for further investigation in the evening of March 22, 1989
(tsn. p. 7, Aug. 21, 1989).  At 12:20
a.m. of the following day, one of the injured children, Annabelle, died as a
result of the gunshot wounds she suffered (Exh. H).  The other child, Samuel Jr., who was shot in the right forearm,
was discharged from the hospital one week after the incident, but needed two
(2) more weeks for healing (tsn. p. 3, Aug. 21, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On March 26, 1989, Arlyn Jimenez executed a sworn statement
(Exh. B) wherein she identified appellant as the culprit.  On March 30, 1989, a certain Ramon Bacnotan
executed a sworn statement (Exh. J) and turned over to the police the sumpak
(Exh. A) allegedly used by appellant in the shooting of the two children.”<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's version of the case is that:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 5:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m. of March 19, 1989,
accused-appellant and his co-workers together with his father were in his house
drinking several bottles of beer since it was a Sunday and they have just
received their wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 9:00 p.m., they separated and he proceeded to his aunt's
house to sleep.  Since his uncle died he
used to keep her aunt and her six children company for want of a male
companion.</p>

<p class="BODY">About midnight of March 19, 1989, his Auntie, SONIA CANARIA
CASTILLO, woke him up as his brother, ROLANDO VALENCIA, knocked at their
door.  As she opened the door, she saw
Rolando accompanied by several policeman who handcuffed the accused and brought
him to the ONG DETACHMENT, Paco, Manila, together with his brother
ROLANDO.  The relatives of the accused
together with his aunt attempted to visit them but they were allegedly refused
admittance to their detention cell.</p>

<p class="BODY">ROLANDO VALENCIA was released on March 22, 1989 while ALEJANDRO
VALENCIA who denied any participation in the shooting, was turned over to the
Investigator of the HOMICIDE SECTION, Pat. Renato Marquez, at about 11:30 p.m.
of the same date.  ROLANDO VALENCIA when
released had a swollen face but was allegedly advised not to tell any one about
the maltreatment that he and his brother, Alejandro had received if he wanted
to see his brother alive.  So he did
nothing for fear that ALEJANDRO VALENCIA might be salvaged.  On one occasion, when he was visited by his
parents, accused-appellant told them of his request to be taken to a doctor for
treatment, but the police refused.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged incredibility and flip-flopping testimonies do not
exist and could be explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it is worthwhile mentioning the reason why at
first no eyewitnesses volunteered to testify in this case and for which, the
court may take judicial notice of.  The
incident occurred in Anak Bayan, Paco, Manila, a place notorious for its high
incidence of criminality even before World War II.  With the increase in its population of urban poor after the war
and the formation of teenage gangs, one resided in Anak Bayan either out of
sheer desperation or because his forefathers lived there and out of necessity
one could not help but lived with them and take his chances with the
environment.  One always lives in
constant fear of being killed or maimed or forced to take drugs from the
pushers that hang around the place.  Ramon
Bacnotan, (the person who found the sumpak and gave it to the police) in his
statement to the police,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

habang ako ay naglalakad duon sa malapit sa pinangyarihan ay narinig ko ang mga

nuong malaman ko na hinahanap ng mga pulis ay pinuntahan ko at nakita ko nga na

<p class="BODY">Arlyn B. Jimenez testified that as she and her son, Samuel were
about to eat, she saw "Ponga" holding a sumpak a few feet away from
her open door.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

Momentarily thereafter, a shot was fired through her door, hitting her
children.  With her two children in
serious condition Arlyn rushed them to the Philippine General Hospital, and in
her state of hysteria and shock, Arlyn was in no position to tell the police
investigator who shot her children,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> nor
recall whether a rumble preceded the shooting or not.  All that she could tell the police at that point in time was that
the sumpak pellets passed through her shanty door, which she had just closed.  Arlyn's testimony should be considered in
the light of the fact that there is no standard of behavior when one is
confronted with a shocking incident,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

shocking incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to accused-appellant's assertions, the photograph
presented in evidence indeed shows that the bullet holes were on the door and
not on the wall of the shanty.  This was
corroborated by Pat. Cajiles who testified that the shanty door "happen to
have gunshot damages."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses cited by accused-appellant have not been shown to be deliberately
made to distort the truth and cannot, therefore, be regarded as dissolving and
destroying the probative value of the witnesses' testimonies on the identity of

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(1)  While she, her mother and her son, Samuel
Jimenez, Jr., were taking supper in their shanty at around 8:30-9:00 o'clock in
the evening of March 19, 1989, she saw Ponga, who is accused Alejandro
Valencia, standing <span style="">a </span>few meters
outside holding a homemade shotgun, locally known as 'sumpak'.  Afraid of any untoward incident or of their
involvement thereof, she immediately closed the door of their house.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(2)  Not long after she closed the door of their
house, there was a gun blast  coming
from in front of their hovel, from the direction where she saw Ponga
standing.  That shot injured her two
children, Annabelle and Samuel, Jr., causing the death of the former four days
later and injuring the latter's forearm causing his hospitalization for one
week and another 2 weeks for complete recovery.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(3)  Upon seeing her two children wounded, she
opened the door of their dwelling to ask for help.  At that precise moment, she saw accused Alejandro Valencia
running away and carrying the same homemade shotgun (<u>sumpak</u>).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(4)  The several holes (6 of them) of the door
(made of plywood) to their house unmistakably show that they were produced by
pellets of a shotgun bullet and one bigger hole shows that it was made by a
shotgun <span style="">bullet because of the size of
its circumference.  In fact, Pat.
Roberto Cajiles recovered 3 pellets at the door.</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(5)  A homemade shotgun (<u>sumpak</u>) - now
Exhibit "A") was retrieved from a canal/ditch very near the hut of
Arlyn Barredo-Jimenez by Ramon Bacnotan and surrendered to Pat. Edgardo Paterno
on March 30, 1989.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(6)  That there was a rumble involving 2 rival
gangs immediately preceding the shooting incident that night of March 19, 1989
participated in by accused Alejandro Valencia is <span style="">admitted b</span>y <span style="">the defense
in its offer of People's Tonight issue of March 20, 1989 (Exhibit
"1").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Are these circumstances sufficient to support the conviction of the
accused, affording as it does the basis for a reasonable inference of the
existence of the fact thereby sought to be proved?"</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x </span>x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In answer thereto, the Court finds the above-enumerated
circumstances to be sufficient to prove the guilt of the accused beyond
reasonable doubt.  For there is no
showing whatsoever by the defense that Arlyn Barredo-Jimenez, victim's mother,
was motivated by ill-will or evil design to testify against the accused.  In the absence, therefore, of any such
showing tending to question her motive and integrity, her testimony should be
given full credit in the light of the time-honored pronouncement that the
absence of improper or evil motive for a State witness to make false
imputations against the accused strengthens his credibility (People vs. Rose,
Sr., et al., L?80457, September 29, 1988, 166 SCRA 110; People vs.
Cabatit, L-62030-31, October 4, 1985, 139 SCRA 94; People vs. Beltran, et <span style="">al., </span>L-37168-69, September 13, 1985,
138 SCRA 521; People vs. Sogales, L-31938, February 20, 1984, 127 SCRA 520;
People vs. Vengco, et al., L-31657 &amp; 32264, January 31, 1984, 127 SCRA 242;
People vs. Aposago, et al., L­-32477, October 30, 1981, 108 SCRA 574, and other
numerous cases).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, Arlyn Barredo-Jimenez testified that while they were taking
their supper that night of March 19, 1989, she happened to glance through the
open door of their hut and she saw the accused, outside, standing a few meters
away, holding a homemade shotgun (<u>sumpak</u>).  Lest she may get embroiled in any untoward incident, she
hurriedly went to close the door.  She
recognized that person standing outside due to the light in front of their house
and the fluorescent lamp at the back of their neighbor's house, thus
illuminating the place where the person was standing.  Soon after she closed the door, there was a gun blast and then
she heard the moanings and cries of pain of her two children, Annabelle and
Samuel, Jr.  When she looked at them,
she saw them bloodied and writhing in pain.  Immediately, she opened the door of their hovel to ask for help.  Once she opened the door, she saw the
accused, Alejandro Valencia, running away and carrying with his right hand the
homemade shotgun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition, the telltale bullet marks of the door proved without
doubt that they were produced by a shotgun bullet and pellets thereof.  Pat. Renato Marquez testified that he saw
those bullet and pellet holes at the door when he went to investigate the place
after he received a report of the incident from Pat. Ramon Cajiles of the Ong
Detachment.  From his investigation,
only one suspect has been consistently mentioned and that is accused Alejandro
Valencia who is identified by those he investigated as Ponga.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All these circumstances are found by the Court to be consistent
with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused, Alejandro
Valencia, is guilty thereof, and at the same time inconsistent with any other
hypothesis except that of his guilt.  They constitute an unbroken chain which leads to a fair and reasonable
conclusion pointing to the defendant, Alejandro Valencia, to the exclusion of
all others, as the author of the two crimes; a chain of natural and rational
circumstances corroborating each other and they certainly can not be overcome
by the very inconcrete and doubtful evidence submitted by him (Erlanger and
Galinger, Inc. vs. Exconde, L­-4792 and L-4795, September 20, 1953) as will be
pointed out later.  Then, too, the facts
that no less than the accused's brother, Ramon Valencia, brought the policeman
to their aunt's house to arrest the herein accused is another<span style=""> </span>circumstance to show that, indeed,
herein accused is guilty thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the case of illegal possession of the sumpak,
Criminal Case No. 89-72657 was dismissed upon motion of the prosecution is
irrelevant and immaterial as what is material is that Arlyn Jimenez saw Ponga
holding the sumpak shotgun before the shooting<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a> and
saw him again holding the said weapon while running away after the shooting.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Said criminal case was dismissed because the trial court applied Section 1,
P.D. No. 1866 to accused-appellant's case.  Thus, the trial court correctly ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"Finally, the accused did not adduce any evidence of whatever
nature to show that he has the authorization or permit to possess the homemade
shotgun (Exhibit "A").  As a
matter of fact, there is no need to discuss further this matter because such
kind of firearm can not be licensed/registered with the Firearms and Explosives
Unit, PC, as it is a homemade shotgun.  The Court can take judicial notice that said firearm can fire and cause
injury even death, to a person.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1866, as amended, provides
that if homicide or murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearms,
the penalty of death shall be imposed.  Since death occurred as a consequence of the use of an unlicensed
firearm (homemade shotgun) in Criminal Case No. 89-72061, the penalty so
provided therein should be imposed.”<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that maltreatment or torture was employed by the police
in the course of their investigation of the case at bar, which of course We
condemn, the person allegedly tortured or maltreated was the appellant's
brother, Rolando, not the appellant himself, who, incidentally was
released.  Rolando Valencia, if he was
indeed tortured, has remedies under the law for the vindication of his rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the appellant's contention in his Brief<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
that he was likewise tortured into confessing that he fired the
"sumpak", a careful review of the records and exhibits does not
reveal that the prosecution presented his confession, if any, during the
trial.  His conviction was not based on
his alleged confession but on the strength of the testimony of the victim's
mother.  Furthermore,
accused-appellant's claim of police brutality cannot be given weight as he
never formally complained to the police or to the fiscal nor presented any
medical certificate to prove the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>
