<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court, at about 12:00 noon on October 3,
1988, Arlene was playing with two other young girls named Irene and Marilou in
front of a house which was being constructed near her home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, who resides in a house about eight
(8) meters away, called Arlene and requested her to buy P2.00 worth of Hope
cigarettes for him from the store of one Aling Belen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arlene bought the Hope cigarettes and then
went <span style="">to </span>the house of appellant
to deliver the cigarettes as instructed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After receiving the cigarettes, appellant suddenly closed the door of
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nobody else inside
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant threatened Arlene <span style="">and </span><span style="">then brought her to his room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once inside the room, he forcibly stripped Arlene naked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also took off all his clothes and,
thereafter, forcibly laid Arlene </span>down on the floor and placed himself on
top of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant placed his penis
inside the private organ of Arlene.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Arlene felt pain as the penis of appellant entered her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant touched Arlene's breasts while he
was on top of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His penis was
inside Arlene's private part for about five (5) minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arlene was unable to shout because of fear.</p>

<p class="BODY">After this, appellant put on his clothes while Arlene also put on
her clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before leaving the house,
appellant gave Arlene P20.00 which the latter accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was threatened not to report the matter
to her mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arlene went home and,
later, she spent the P20.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At about 10:00 o'clock<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>morning
of November 4, 1988, Arlene was playing with other children </span>in front of
her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant called her and
requested her to buy Hope cigarettes worth P3.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After buying the cigarettes, Arlene proceeded
to an old abandoned house to give the cigarettes to appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the place where appellant had told
Arlene to go in order to deliver the cigarettes to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This vacant house was about sixty (60) meters
away from the house of Arlene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
happened thereafter was a repetition of the first sordid incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the vacant house, Arlene gave the cigarettes to
appellant who, after receiving the cigarettes, closed the door of the vacant
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He quickly undressed himself and
also forcibly undressed Arlene.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant forcibly laid Arlene on the floor and then placed himself atop
Arlene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He inserted his private organ
inside the sexual organ of Arlene, at the same time touching her breasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arlene again felt pain as appellant inserted
his penis inside her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His penis
remained inside the sexual organ of Arlene for about five (5) minutes while
Arlene was lying down on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
put on his clothes after this, while Arlene dressed up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before leaving the vacant house, appellant
gave Arlene P20.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before she went
home, she was again threatened not to tell her mother or anybody else about the
sexual encounter.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At about 6:00 o'clock on
the evening of December 6, 1988, Evelyn Labarlado, a 23-year old neighbor of
Leticia Cabe, the mother of Arlene Cabe, went to the latter's house at Bagong
Silang, Caloocan City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evelyn asked
Leticia if she had learned about the sexual molestations suffered by the
latter's child, Arlene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Leticia
confronted her daughter Arlene right then and there in the presence of Evelyn
Labarlado.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arlene admitted that she was
really sexually molested by appellant "Mang Terio," whose full name

Arlene Cabe was subjected to medical examination for alleged rape at the
Philippine Constabulary Crime Laboratory at Camp Crame, Quezon City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Desiderio Moraleda, chief of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On a sole assignment of
error that the trial court allegedly convicted appellant despite the existence
of reasonable doubt, counsel for appellant predictably attacks the credibility
of the minor victim's testimony for want of any other possible defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also banks on the possibility that </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">disclaimer of any participation in the crime and the imputation and
shifting of culpability therefor on a gambling friend of his, one Rostum, would
prosper as a credible defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Solicitor General
convincingly met the contentions of appellant, and we quote his arguments with
approval:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Appellant contends that victim Arlene Cabe's testimony is not
credible because --</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -17.7pt;">'1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she did not struggle or make any outcry at
the time of the alleged rape; 2) she accepted P20.00 from the accused on two
occasions of the rape; 3) she never told her mother or any other relative(s)
about the sexual molestation.'</p>

<p class="2Q">(Appellant's Brief, p. 5).</p>

<blockquote>"Such contention is untenable because the above cited
circumstances can be easily explained by the fact of the victim's tender age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that Arlene Cabe, at the
time of the rape, was only 11 years old.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering her young age, she could easily have been intimidated by the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, appellant threatened
her with a knife at the time of the first rape on October 3, 1988 (Tsn., p. 17,
March 14, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Anent appellant's claim that the victim did not tell anyone
about the rape, this is belied by the record, particularly by the victim's own
testimony, to wit:</blockquote>

contention, as natural as those expected of an 11-year old and grade-four
student, which she was.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant insists that ‘what makes Arlene's testimony
incredible is the identical manner by which she was allegedly raped by the
accused on October 3, 1988 and November 4, 1988.’ (Appellant's Brief, p. 5)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An analysis of the victim's statements on what transpired
immediately prior to and during the rape, reveals that there is nothing
incredible in what Arlene Cabe told the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Firstly, with respect to the manner she was led by the
appellant to go inside the latter's house (requesting her first to buy
cigarettes and deliver them to his house), this <u><span style="">modus</span></u><span style=""> <u>operandi</u>
</span>of the appellant indeed happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the witness’ repetition of the appellant's <u>modus</u> <u>operandi</u>
resorted to by him on the two occasions she was raped shows her tenacity to
tell the truth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Secondly, anent the appellant's insertion of his penis inside
the victim's vagina, there is no other way rape can be committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the repetition of this circumstance in
the victim's account of the two rape incidents is logical and credible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lastly, the fact that appellant's penis was inside the
victim's sex organ for five minutes in both instances is not an indicator of
the falsity of the victim's testimony, but rather, reflects more of the
appellant's sexual prowess, or his lack of it.</blockquote>

giving similar accounts of the two rape incidents.</blockquote>

obscene language ('kinakantot n'ya ako') when she testified in Court to attack
the witness' credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, this
contention is untenable for the simple reason that calling a spade a spade is
not an alteration or distortion of the truth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, this can be attributed to the victim's tender age and innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the limited vocabulary and lack of
malice in uttering such words.</blockquote>

was credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She described the force

medico-legal findings made when Arlene was examined on December 7, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given the naivete and age of the complainant,
it is difficult to conceive that her rape charges were fabricated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that after the first rape, the
complainant did not stay away from the accused who was able to gain carnal
knowledge of her again is explicable from her young age and fear (People vs.
Bano, 142 SCRA 476).’</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The gravamen of the
offense of statutory rape, as provided in Article 335, paragraph 3 of the
Revised Penal Code, is the carnal knowledge of </span><span style="">a woman </span><span style="">below twelve (12)
years of age at the time she was raped; proof of intimidation or force used on
her, or lack of it, is immaterial.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Furthermore, in this case, after each act
the appellant threatened to kill complainant if she would tell anyone about his
</span>lascivious acts, each threat installing fear in the mind of the minor,
which made her an "easy prey in his subsequent sallies."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further claims that it was incredible for Arlene, after
the rape, to nonchalantly go out clutching the twenty-peso bill <span style="">and </span>to continue playing with her
friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To him, it was unlikely that a
young girl traumatized by a rape would act thereafter in a natural
fashion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, even among adults,
different people react differently to a given situation or type of situation,
and there is no standard form of human behavioral response when one is
confronted with a strange or startling or frightful experience.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">More important, appellant fails to consider that the victim is
still of tender age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A child who is only
eleven (11) years old may not yet know or fully realize the detestable nature
and gravity of he acts committed upon her person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A child can easily be made to believe
otherwise, as could have been the case of Arlene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it is not uncommon for
young girls to conceal for some time the assaults on their virtue because of
the rapist's threat on their lives.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It should be borne <span style="">in </span>mind that
this case involves a victim of tender years and limited schooling whose actions
under such difficult a<span style="">nd trying
circumstances are dominated more by fear than by reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She cannot be expected to have such exceptional
courage as to disregard a threat on her life.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But even assuming that
Arlene may have innocently or otherwise dispensed of her sexual favors as
alleged by appellant, particularly if she were paid for it, such fact cannot
change the revolting truth that appellant molested an 11-year old child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rape is committed even if the girl under
twelve (12) years old consented to the sexual act or, for that matter, even if
she were a prostitute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The court below found the
testimony of Arlene Cabe credible and convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a firmly settled doctrine that the
findings of the trial court, which had the inestimable advantage of observing
the detailed demeanor of the witnesses are entitled to great respect.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Nor has appellant invoked any justification
for a departure from this rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Regarding the competency
of a child to testify, the decision of this question rests primarily with the
trial judge, who sees the proposed witness, notices his manner, his apparent
possession or lack of intelligence, as well as his understanding of the
obligations of an oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As many of these
matters cannot be photographed </span>into the record, the decision of the
trial judge will not be disturbed on review, unless from what is preserved it
is clear that it was erroneous.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is the theory of
appellant that the rape case against him was fabricated by mother and daughter
since they have </span>a <span style="">pique against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court considers this final
argument as nothing but a wild and desperate concoction by appellant in order
to evade punishment for his ignominious acts of perversion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, it is inconceivable that a mother
would draw her young daughter into a rape scam, with all its attendant scandal
and humiliation, just to rid herself of an unwanted stranger.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
