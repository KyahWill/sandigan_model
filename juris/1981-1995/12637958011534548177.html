<p class="BODY">Upon petitioner's refusal to vacate the premises upon written
demand made by private respondent on February 1, 1979, private respondent filed
the case for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> based on the expiration of the

defendant, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Syquia</span> (herein petitioner) to
vacate the premises and to pay plaintiff Litton, P31,781.16 a month as the
reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises from February 1,

less any amount that defendant may have deposited with the court and withdrawn
by the plaintiff and that defendant's counterclaim was dismissed for lack of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was elevated to the Court of Appeals by way of Petition
for Review under Republic Act 6031, with <span class="SpellE">Syquia</span>
assailing the aforementioned decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellate court upon a split vote of four Justices con­curring to
one dissenting, affirmed the decision of the lower court and dismissed the
petition for review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal,
petitioner relying on the following arguments:</p>

this case not in accord with law as well as applicable decisions of the Supreme
Court.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">B</p>

erred in its interpretation and applica­tion of Art. 1403 of the Civil Code of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

Rules of Court.</blockquote>

in the amount of P28,000.00 a month.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To have a better grasp of the facts and issues of the case, We
find it necessary to quote the pertinent portion of the judgment of the
Regional Trial Court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful perusal of the evidence of both parties,
their arguments and their memoranda, the court finds that the principal issue
is whether or not the defendant is entitled to a renewal of the contract of
lease, Exhibit "G", which on its face, expired on January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">31, 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>In other words, can the alleged verbal assurances of George
Litton Sr. and Gloria Litton del <st1:place>Rio</st1:place> be sufficient basis
to vary the written contract and allow the defendant an extension of the lease
contract, which, on its surface, already expired on <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="1">January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">31, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>There
is no dispute that the contract of lease, Exhibit "G", entered into
by and between the defendant and plain­tiff's predecessors-in-interest, has
been terminated by its express provision appearing in paragraph 1, which states
that the lease shall be for a period of nine (9) years com­mencing on <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="1">January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1,
 1970</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>and
ending on <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="1">January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">31, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant claims that this case was filed prematurely
considering that he is entitled to a renewal of the contract, that one of the
inducements which made him enter into a lease agreement with plaintiff's
predecessor-in-interest was the oral assurance of said plaintiff's
predecessor-in-interest that the defendant is entitled to a renewal or a
priority to lease the premises upon the expiration of the contract of lease;
that in view of the close relationship then existing between the defendant and
George Litton Sr. and Gloria Litton del Rio and the trust and confidence relied
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">by </span>defendant on both part­ies,
defendant did not insist on the insert­ion of the provision regarding his
priority to lease the premises in Exhibit "G"; that Exhibit
"G" is merely a copy of a previous contract <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">of </span>lease, Exhibit "12"; that when defendant pointed to
George Litton Sr. and Gloria Litton del Rio of his priority to lease <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>premises, the latter assured him
that he should not worry regarding the absence of the option <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>renew the lease contract, Exhibit
"G" because he would be given priority <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">to </span>lease the premises upon the expira­tion of the lease contract;
that because of this verbal assurance of George Litton Sr. and Gloria Litton
del Rio, and that plaintiff, having assumed or acquired the rights and
obligations of the former when he became the owner of the property subject of
this case, the plaintiff is now duty-bound to respect the verbal assurance
given by the plaintiff's predecessor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>give
him a renewal or priority <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>a
new lease over the property and that defendant should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">now </span>be made to exercise his option to renew the lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, plaintiff should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">be </span>compelled to abide by the commitment
made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">by his </span>predecessor-in-interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant further claims that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">is </span>entitled to exercise his option to extend or renew the lease
considering the huge invest­ment he has made on the <st1:place><st1:placename>Dutch</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Inn</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff, however, insists that by the
expira­tion of the contract of lease, he has the right to demand <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>take action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> and that defendant should vacate the premises and
to pay the amount of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">P58,685.00 </span>as
monthly rental, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">is </span>the
reasonable compensation for the use of the premises after <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1979</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From his testimony in the lower court, defendant stated that
he was assured or promised by George Litton Sr. and Gloria Litton del <st1:place>Rio</st1:place>,
representatives of the Litton Finance &amp; Investment Corp.; that he,
defendant, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Syquia</span>, would be given priority to
lease the same property after the expiration of the lease contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to the plaintiff, there is infringement of the
Statute of Frauds as well as the <span class="SpellE">Parol</span> Evidence
Rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the defendant
invokes the exception contained in Section 7, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court (<span class="SpellE">Parol</span> Evidence Rule).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant contends that antecedent factors were involved which induced
him to enter into the contract of lease with Litton Finance &amp; Investment
Corp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This brings us to the provision of
Statute of Frauds under Article 1403, No. 2(e), which provides as follows:</blockquote>

hour defense of the defend­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ant </span>when
the plaintiff refused to renew the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The inference of said letter is very clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the defendant had no right or preference
to renew the contract and that was the reason why he was request­ing to
negotiate for the renewal of the contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>sake
of argument that there really was a verbal agreement or promise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">on </span>the part of George Litton Sr. and
Gloria del <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rio </span>to allow
defendant to renew the contract of lease at its expiration, the court believes
that such assurance or promise would not have any binding effect on the
original <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, the Litton Finance &amp; Investment
Corporation, considering that defendant did not adduce any evidence to show in
what capacity George Litton Sr. and Gloria Litton del Rio gave that assurance
and considering further that it was James Litton who signed the contract of
lease, Exhibit "G" in representation of Litton Finance &amp;
Investment Corporation as its director-vice-president.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the Corporation Law, 'corporation's
acts are only valid if a board resolution authorizes said acts, otherwise, said
unauthorized acts are not binding to it.' The evidence does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">no show </span>that the act of George Litton
Sr. and Gloria Litton del <st1:place>Rio</st1:place> had been ratified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The last issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">is </span>the
reasonable compensation for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">use </span>and
occupation by the defendant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of </span>the
premises in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lower court
fixed the reasonable compensation in the amount of P31,781.16 a month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This court cannot understand how the lower
court reached at that alleged reasonable monthly compensation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Antonio <span class="SpellE">Doria</span>, the expert witness, presented by the defendant
appears to be a neutral and unbiased witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under cross-examination <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">by the </span>plaintiff,
he testified as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is crystal clear that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
did not whimsically decide the case, nor decide <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">it </span>without substantial basis in support thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing the petition of appellant <span class="SpellE">Syquia</span>,
respondent Court of Appeals relied heavily on the find­ings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of </span>fact of the Regional Trial Court and
concluded t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">hat </span>there is "a
lot more than substantial evidence supporting the court <u>a</u> <u>quo's</u>
finding of fact and that the conclusions arrived at by his honor are clearly
not against the law and jurisprudence." The case in­volves unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> and respondent Court of Appeals correctly applied
the "substantial evidence" rule as<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

of 1948.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said Act which was applied in

<p class="BODY">It is noted that petitioner is among other things a successful
and experienced businessman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering
his huge investment made on the building, he should have taken steps to protect
his investment within the protective mantle of the law by insisting that the
alleged verbal assurance be reduced into writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>failure
to do so has considerably weakened his claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proof of the alleged verbal assurance of a lease <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">re­</span>newal cannot be allowed both under
the <span class="SpellE">Parol</span> Evidence Rule and the Statute of Frauds for
failure to put in writing said alleged stipulation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand We are inclined to consider
<span class="SpellE">Syquia</span> as having constructed in good faith the
improvements he introduced in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Dutch</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Inn</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His rights to said improvements are governed
by Art. 1678 of the Civil Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1678.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
lessee makes, in good faith, useful improvements which are suitable to the use
for which the lease is intended, without altering the form or substance of the
property leased, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> upon the termination of
the lease shall pay the lessee one-half of the value of the improvements at
that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Should the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> refuse to reimburse said amount, the lessee may
remove the improvements, even though the principal thing may suffer damage
thereby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall not, however, cause
any more impairment upon the property leased than is necessary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“With regard to ornamental ex­penses, the lessee shall not be
entitled to any reimbursement, but he may remove the ornamental objects,
provided no damage is caused to the principal thing, and the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> does not choose to retain them by paying their value
at the time the lease is extinguished."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner admits the fact of ownership of the pri­vate
respondent over the building in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the owner, it is only logical that he should have the freedom to
choose the tenant of the premises under such terms and conditions as may enable
him to realize reasonable and fair returns <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioner stubbornly refused to vacate
the premises despite repeated demands of respondent, he should be obliged to
compensate the latter such amount as may be deemed fair and reasonable under
the circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What then is
reasonable?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An expert witness in the
person of Mr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Doria</span> testified in the court
below and thus established that P28,000.00 is fair and reasonable rental under
the pre­mises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, judicial notice
is requested by private respondent of the runaway inflation which supervened
since January 31, 1979, contending that had the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span>premises been vacated at the expiration of the contract on
January 31, 1979, the latter (private respondent) could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">have </span>leased it immediately to other interested parties under such
terms that could have taken into consideration the inflation rate at the time
and provided for periodic rate escalation corresponding to subsequent
inflation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends likewise that
petitioner is a possessor in bad faith with his continued enjoyment of the
premises after the expiration of the lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot grant the foregoing prayer of private respondent
without denying due process of law to petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While We can take judicial cognizance of the
fact of inflation, there is no sufficient evidence pre­sented to <span class="SpellE">subtantiate</span> respondent's claim of his actual loss in
petitioner's failure to surrender the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the next assignment of error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The instant case is not within the scope of
Art. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">1687 </span>of the Civil Code which
covers lease contracts with no fixed period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The contract of lease in question is with a definite period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus to extend the lease of petition­er would
be completely devoid of legal basis, inasmuch as the stipulated period of the
contract between the parties had already expired and private respondent is
unwilling to extend the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
no way therefore that herein petitioner can hold on to the property after <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="1">January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">31,
 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>without
