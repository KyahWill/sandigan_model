<p class="BODY">In the above-mentioned case, we affirmed the decisions of the

<blockquote>"II. THE
DISMISSAL OF THE INSTANT CASE ON THE GROUND OF PRESCRIPTION IS A CORRUPTION OF
JUDICIAL <span class="GramE">PROCESS<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AS</span>
IT IS AS BASELESS AS IT WAS UNLAWFUL.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 151)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1987</st1:date>,
petitioner then filed a Supplement to the Motion for Reconsideration "to
elucidate on the following vital legal issues, to wit:"</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The issue of prescription, which was never
raised in the pleadings of the private respondent much less proved in the
trial, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unceremoniously, became the sole
ground for dismissal of this case;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The issue that petitioner worked in Sydney,
Australia, under the same employment contract he had with the Philippine branch
of Grolier International was sidetracked conveniently, despite the fact that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the evidence of the petitioner regarding this
matter stood unchallenged in the records of the proceedings;</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The ruling that under the circumstances of the
case, the merits of the petitioner's claims against private respondent was <span class="GramE">unnecessary,</span> is absurd and devoid of basis in law;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The citation of Article 281 of the Labor Code
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
has absolutely no relevance to the case at bar."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 161-162)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner alleges that the failure of private respondent to
specifically plead prescription in its position paper constitutes a waiver of
the defense of prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u>Director</u> <u>of</u> <u>Lands</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Dano</u></span><u>,</u> (96 SCRA 161,165), this Court held that
"inasmuch as petitioner had never pleaded the statute of limitations, he
is deemed to have waived the same."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that there are exceptions to the rule that an action
will not be declared to have prescribed if prescription is not expressly
invoked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Garcia v. Mathis, 100 SCRA
250).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, where considerations of
substantial justice come in, it is better to resolve the issues on the basic
merits of the case instead of applying the rule on prescription which the
private respondent waived when it was not pleaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the finding of prescription of the Labor Arbiter is not
indubitable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said that the
petitioner was "dismissed" from employment on <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1975</st1:date> when he flew back to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
from <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both petitioner and private respondent
treated the return to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> as a
condition precedent to the approval of Fernandez' immigration papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He remained a Grolier's employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As late as September, 1975 the respondent's
Mr. William Murphy was still following up the petitioner's immigration papers
with the Australian Embassy in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only in May, 1976, three months before
the instant case was filed with the Ministry of Labor and Employment, that
Fernandez was dismissed by the private respondent after a final decision by
Australian authorities that he could not enter <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as an immigrant.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful review of the records in relation to the motion for
reconsideration constrains us to grant the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Fernandez stresses that the private respondent chose
to base its case solely on jurisdiction and lately on prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent's version of the facts is
based on an affidavit of Ronald <span class="SpellE">Besaw</span> but the affiant
was never presented as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The petitioner cited the
pertinent portion of the proceedings to support its contention that the proof
upon which we earlier based our assessment of the facts is not evidence but
consists of unsubstantiated allegations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The record states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ATTORNEY ALCANTARA</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Due to illness,
I was not able to prepare a written motion to dismiss as I undertook some weeks
ago, your Honor.</blockquote>

may be allowed to file now or make an oral motion to dismiss in order not to
prolong the proceedings, I would like to ask for the dismissal of the case on
the ground that this Honorable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Commission
does not have any jurisdiction over the instant case.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the
testimony of the complainant, it appears that he accepted work for the Grolier
Society of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which is a corporation or an entity which is separate and distinct from the
respondent in this case, the Grolier International, Inc., your Honor.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

and from his testimony it appears that he received his pay from the Grolier
Society of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

we reiterate should therefore be filed against the instant respondent, your Honor.</blockquote>

register our opposition to the motion to dismiss this case on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction on the part of this Honorable Office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must be
understood that Grolier International, Inc. is an international corporation by
the very name it suggests, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By its very
name, it transacts business in different parts of the world, your Honor, and
many cases have been decided already like the case of <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>
versus Cathay Pacific, the case of <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> versus Air
<st1:country-region><st1:place>France</st1:place></st1:country-region>, which
are all international corporations, your Honor.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;

<blockquote>"The complaint
did not happen here but charges were filed here, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this
particular case, in the absence of any definite evidence to be presented here
and challenged in the records of the defense is the fact that while the
plaintiff performed functions in Australia and received pay there, all these
were done under his employment contract with the Philippine Branch, unless
defendant can present or show that there was an employment contract in Sydney
whereby it would prove termination of relationship employment, rather,
employment relationship with the Philippine Branch, the ground of lack of
jurisdiction is without basis and entirely absurd, your Honor."</blockquote>

p. 152)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may be recalled that Mr. Fernandez started working with
Grolier International, Inc., <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1964</st1:date> working his
way to Comptroller and Executive Administrator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1974</st1:date> he
left for <st1:place><st1:city>Sydney</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Australia</st1:country-region></st1:place>
where he worked with Grolier Society, Ltd. of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
from <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1974</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1975</st1:date> with an annual salary
of 8,000 Australian <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">dollars.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had to return to the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> to follow up his immigration papers but on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">February
 19, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, his bid
for immigration status was not approved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In May, 1976, the denial became final.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The basic factual issue may be stated thus - Did Mr. Fernandez <span class="GramE">resign</span> from his employment when he left for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
or may his employment abroad be considered a continuation of his Philippine
employment to entitle him to reinstatement and/or separation benefits?</p>

<p class="BODY">A second and hard look at the case shows that even if we accept
the private respondent's statement of facts in his pleadings and memorandum
before us, when this statement is weighed against the petitioner's evidence
submitted during the proceedings below, the balance would tilt in favor of the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that Grolier International is a company based in
<st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine and Australian offices are
both managed by the same person - Managing Director Ronald <span class="SpellE">Besaw</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was Mr. <span class="SpellE">Besaw</span>
who transferred Fernandez to <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>
to take the place of Janette Williams, accountant of the Australian office, who
had resigned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To facilitate the travel
and exit permit, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Besaw</span> made it appear that
Fernandez would attend a series of conferences in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
when there were no such conferences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
just so happened that the services of Fernandez were needed in <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>
at the time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent contends that the petitioner voluntarily
resigned so he could migrate to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is highly unlikely that the petitioner who
was already Comptroller and Executive Administrator of Grolier's Philippine
operations would voluntarily resign and take his chances, at his age, in a
foreign country if he had not been assured of continued employment at a higher
income in Grolier's Australian operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No resignation papers were signed and absolutely no reason <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for termination of </span>employment is
apparent from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fernandez held the highest position open to a
</span>Filipino in his company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner did not go to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as immigrant or prospective immigrant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His employer sent him abroad ostensibly for a series of seminars but
actually to secure his services as an accountant or financial officer in <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the brighter prospects of
employment with the <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city> office,
the petitioner may have been very interested in being transferred there,
applying for immigration papers, and working permanently in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To interpret that desire and the acceptance
of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Besaw's</span> order to go to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as tantamount to resignation would, however, be stretching the facts too thinly.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> office and the <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>
office are different juridical entities separately incorporated in each of the
two countries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the separate
incorporation is dictated by requirements of law and convenience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As far as the mother multinational
corporation is concerned, the <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city> offices are merely
marketing arms of the same employer, distributing the same line of goods, and
obeying unified management and operating rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is significant that there was never a contract of employment between
the petitioner and Grolier's of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The employment contract in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
sufficed to cover Fernandez' seven months work in the <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>
office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Fernandez traveled to <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>
on a visitor's visa clearly stamped by Australian authorities with
"Employment Prohibited".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There are other factual
considerations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1974</st1:date>
letter of Mr. Ronald <span class="SpellE">Besaw</span> asked petitioner Fernandez
to attend "a series of conferences of finance executives of the company to
be held in our Sydney Office starting <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="6">June
 27, 1974</st1:date>." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.9) He,
therefore, went abroad on company business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His expenses were shared by the <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city> offices.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, while Fernandez' fare to
Sydney was shouldered by Grolier's International, the expenses for his return
flight were deducted from his last salaries after the company decided not to
give him back his position in the Philippine office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even when the petitioner had already returned to Manila on
February <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">3, </span>1975, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Besaw</span> was still urging the Department of Immigration to
facilitate Fernandez' immigration to Sydney with his family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 22).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same letter refers to
Mr. Manuel L. Fernandez as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"one of
our executives </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">in</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt"> <u>the</u> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Philippines</span></u></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">", </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">not as a former or resigned executive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, rule that the petitioner did not resign from his
employment with the private respondent when he left for <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>
or when he returned to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His services were terminated when it became
final that the Australian authorities would not approve his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">transfer to the respondent's </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sydney</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> office as an immigrant worker.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
