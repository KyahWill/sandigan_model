<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sibagat</span></st1:placename></st1:place>."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioners are residents and taxpayers of 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span>Butuan</span></span></st1:placename><span> 
</span><st1:placetype><span>City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span>, with 
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Clementino</span> <span class="SpellE">Torralba</span>, being a member of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglunsod</span> of the same 
City.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent municipal officers are the local public officials 
of the new Municipality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Section 3, Article XI</span><span> </span><span>of the 1973 
Constitution, said to have been infringed, is reproduced 
hereunder:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 3.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>No province, city, 
municipality, or barrio may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its 
boundary substantially altered, except in accordance with the criteria 
established in the Local Government Code, and subject to the approval by a 
majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite in the unit or units 
affected."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The thrust of petitioners' argument is that under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision, the Local Government Code must first 
be enacted to determine the criteria for the creation, division, merger, 
abolition, or substantial alteration of the boundary of any province, city, 
municipality, or barrio; and that since no Local Government Code had as yet been 
enacted as of the date BP 56 was </span>passed, <span>that statute could not 
have possibly complied with </span><span>any </span><span>criteria when 
respondent Municipality was created, hence, it is null and 
void.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It is a fact that the Local Government Code came into being only 
on <st1:date month="2" day="10" year="1983">10 February 1983</st1:date> so that 
when BP 56 was enacted, the Code was not yet in existence.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
evidence likewise discloses that a plebiscite had been conducted among the 
people of the unit/units affected by the creation of the new Municipality, who 
expressed approval thereof; and that officials of the newly created Municipality 
had been appointed and had assumed their respective positions as such.</p>
<p class="BODY">We find no trace of invalidity of BP 56.<span>&nbsp; </span>The absence 
of the Local Government Code at the time of its enactment did not curtail nor 
was it intended to cripple legislative competence to create municipal 
corporations. <span>&nbsp;</span>Section 3, Article XI of the 1973 Constitution does 
not proscribe nor prohibit the modification of territorial and political 
subdivisions before the enactment of the Local Government Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>It 
contains no requirement that the Local Government Code is a condition <em>sine 
qua non</em> for the creation of a municipality, in much the same way that the 
creation of a new municipality does not preclude the enactment of a Local 
Government Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>What the Constitutional provision means <span>is 
that once said Code is enacted, the creation, modification or dissolution of 
local government units should conform <span class="GramE">with</span> the criteria 
thus laid down.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">intarregnum</span>, 
before the enactment of such Code, the legislative power remains plenary except 
that the creation of the new local government unit should be approved by the 
people concerned in a plebiscite called for the purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The creation of the new 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sibagat</span></st1:placename></st1:place> conformed to said 
requisite.<span>&nbsp; </span>A plebiscite was conducted and the people of the 
unit/units affected endorsed and approved the creation of the new local 
government unit<span> </span><span>(<span class="SpellE">parag</span>. 5, 
Petition; p. 7,</span><span> </span><span>Memorandum).<span>&nbsp; </span></span>In 
fact, the <span>conduct </span>of said plebiscite <span>is </span>not questioned 
herein.<span>&nbsp; </span>The officials of the new Municipality have effectively 
taken their oaths of office and are performing their functions.<span>&nbsp; A 
</span><em>de jure</em> entity has thus been created.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is a long-recognized principle that the power to create a 
municipal corporation is essentially <span class="GramE">legislative</span> in 
nature.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any constitutional limitations, a 
legislative body may create any corporation it deems essential for the more 
efficient administration of government (I <span class="SpellE">McQuillin</span>, 
Municipal Corporations, 3rd ed., 509).<span>&nbsp; </span>The creation of the new 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sibagat</span></st1:placename></st1:place> was <span>a </span>valid 
exercise of legislative power then vested by the 1973 Constitution in the 
Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span><span> </span><span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">We are not unmindful of the case of <em>Tan vs. COMELEC</em> (142 
SCRA 727 [1986]), striking down as unconstitutional BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 885 creating a new province in the Island of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> known as the Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> del Norte, and declaring the plebiscite held in 
connection therewith as illegal.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are significant 
differences, however, in the two cases among which may be mentioned the 
following:<span>&nbsp; </span>in the <em>Tan</em> case, the Local Government Code 
already existed at the time that the challenged statute was enacted on 3 
December 1985; not so in the case at bar.<span>&nbsp; </span>Secondly, BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 885 in the <em>Tan</em> case confined the plebiscite to 
the "proposed new province" to the exclusion of the voters in the remaining 
areas, in contravention of the Constitutional mandate and of the Local 
Government Code that the plebiscite should be held "in the unit or units 
affected".<span>&nbsp; </span>In contrast, BP 56 specifically provides for <span>a 
</span>plebiscite "in the area or areas affected".<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, as 
previously stated, no question is raised herein as to the legality of the 
plebiscite conducted.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, in the <em>Tan</em> case, even the 
requisite area for the creation of a new province was not complied with in BP 
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 885.<span>&nbsp; </span>No such issue in the creation 
of the new municipality has been raised here.<span>&nbsp; </span>And lastly, 
"indecent haste" attended the enactment of BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 885 
and the holding of the plebiscite thereafter <span>in </span>the <em>Tan</em> 
case; on the other hand, BP 56 creating the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sibagat</span>, was enacted in the normal course of legislation, 
and the plebiscite was held within the period specified in that law.</p>

<p>I concur on the assumption that the required plebicite although not

Constitution, and was duly held "in the unot or units affected," <em>i.e.</em>, 
not only in the proposed municipality but also in the mother municipality, in 
line with Tan v. Commission on Elections (142 SCRA 727), revisiong <em>Paredes 
v. Executive Secretary </em>(128 SCRA 6) and <em>Lopez v. Metro Manila 
Commission</em> (136 SCRA 633) insofar as these cases held that the plebescite 
couled be confined only of the political unit proposed to be created.</p></div>
