This is a Petition to Review on <em>Certiorari </em>the decision of the then Court of Appeals in its CA-G.R. No. 64688-R, which affirmed <em>in toto</em>
 on appeal the decision of the defunct Court of First Instance of Cebu 
in Civil Case No. R-15972, en­titled "Priscilo Sy vs. Justiniano Quirino
 - For:  Specific Performance and Damages".
<p>
Petitioner Priscilo Sy (then plaintiff) was the registered owner of a 
parcel of land together with the improvements thereon, situated in the 
municipality of Minglanilla, Province of Cebu, and which is more 
particularly described as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A parcel of land (Lot 4740 of the Talisay-Minglanilla Estate, 
GLRC Record No. 3732) situated in the Municipality of Minglanilla.  
Province of Cebu, Island of Cebu.  Bounded on the N. by Lot 4735, on the
 E. by Lot 4739, on the S. by road, and on the W. by road; containing an
 area of Eight Thousand Three Hundred Seventy One (8,371) square meters 
more or less per technical descrip­tion appearing on covering Transfer 
Certificate of Title No. 21283, Registry of Deeds for the Province of 
Cebu."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On June 25, 1973, petitioner obtained a loan from the Development Bank 
of the Philippines (which will hereafter be referred to as DBP) in the 
amount of P113,200.00, and to secure the payment thereof, petitioner and
 his wife executed a Real Estate Mortgage in favor of the DBP on the 
aforementioned property.
</p><p>
On January 31, 1976, petitioner and respondent Justiniano Quirino 
entered into a lease agree­ment over the said property for a period of 
two (2) years, renewable by mutual consent for another period of two (2)
 years.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, petitioner defaulted in the payment of the stipulated 
amortizations on his loan with the DBP and the latter as mortgagee, sent
 to petitioner on June 29, 1976, a notice of foreclosure.  Petitioner 
sought a re-structuring of said loan and an extension of payment, both 
of which were denied by DBP.  Petitioner then turned to respondent 
Quirino, the lessee of the mortgaged property, and later negotiated with
 him for the sale thereof with assumption of mortgage.
</p><p>
On August 27, 1976, respondent Quirino with the conformity of petitioner
 sent a letter to the DBP proposing to assume the mortgage obligations 
of petitioner.
</p><p>
On September 10, 1976, petitioner and respondent, with the consent of 
their respective spouses, executed a Deed of Sale with Assumption of 
Mortgage of the property in question for and in consideration of One 
Peso (P1.00).  Respondent further agreed to fully assume petitioner's 
obligation with the DBP in the total sum of P153,000.00 subject to the 
condition that the sale will be with the prior approval of the DBP and 
shall automatically take effect upon approval by said bank.  (Exh. 
"1-C")
</p><p>
On November 26, 1976, and by way of approving the Sale with Assumption 
of Mortgage, DBP required respondent and his wife to execute a 
Supplemental Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage (Exh. "1").  On 
December 15, 1976, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 39578 of the land 
records of Cebu covering the mortgaged property was issued in the name 
of respondent Quirino and his wife.
</p><p>
It further appears that on September 10, 1976, petitioner and respondent
 executed a separate docu­ment (not notarized) denominated as Deed of 
Option to Re-purchase (Exh. "13"), the pertinent portion of which reads -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That I, JUSTINIANO QUIRINO, as transferee of the said property, 
for and in consideration of the sum of ONE (P1.00) PESO, Philippine 
Currency, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged hereby GIVE and GRANT 
to Priscilo Sy, of legal age, Filipino; married to Corazon Jimenez, and 
with residence and post-office address at the barrio of Lipata, 
Municipality of Minglanilla, Province of Cebu, the option to repurchase 
the above-described real estate property together with all existing 
improvements found therein upon full payment by said Priscilo Sy to me 
of a total cash consideration that shall equal the total sum of all the 
amounts I shall have paid the Development Bank of the Philippines on  
the mortgage obligation I assumed from transferer Priscilo Sy plus 
interests on the said amounts at the rate of Twelve (12%) Percent per 
annum; it being understood that upon the exercise by him of his option 
to repurchase the aforementioned property; Priscilo Sy shall, aside from
 fully paying the aforementioned amounts, reimbursed me whatever 
expenses I might have incurred in the introduction or construction of 
additional permanent improvements on the above-described real estate 
property. </p>
  <p> "That it is hereby stipulated that in the event Priscilo Sy shall 
unconditionally allow me or my heirs, successors and assigns adequate 
and reasonable time within which to remove and transfer from the 
premises all livestocks; equipments, feeds, and personal properties 
belonging to me; </p>
  <p> "That this option to repurchase granted shall be in force for a 
term of THREE (3) YEARS from the date of execution of this document and 
failure for whatever reason by Priscilo Sy to exercise his option to 
reacquire the property within the stipulated period shall automatically 
render this Deed of Option to Repurchase without force and effect and 
henceforth said Priscilo Sy shall forever be barred from repurchasing 
the said property;"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Another document entitled Deed of Occupancy was also executed on the 
same date, September 10, 1976, granting petitioner Sy the right to 
occupy and use for free for a term of three (3) years the - (a) 
residential house of strong materials which plaintiff shall use as 
family residence; and (b) one-half of the bodega building of strong 
materials which plaintiff may use for storage purposes.
</p><p>
On February 8, 1979 or barely five (5) months from the execution of the 
Deed of Option to Repurchase, petitioner, thru counsel, advised the 
respondent that he (petitioner) has opted to repurchase the property, 
pursuant to the right granted him under the Deed of Option to Repurchase
 further advising him that the amount of P14,941.76 that respondent had 
paid to the DBP was already deposited with his counsel's office.
</p><p>
On February 22, 1977, petitioner informed respondent that because of his
 unjustified refusal to collect the sum of P14,941.76 from his counsel, 
he had decided to consign the said amount with the Clerk of Court of the
 local CFI.
</p><p>
On February 13, 1977, the Clerk of Court wrote respondent advising him of the consigned amount with her office.
</p><p>
On February 26, 1977, respondent thru counsel wrote to the Clerk of 
Court informing her that he and his wife are not willing to accept the 
sum of P14,941.76 as repurchase price on the ground that -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    a)   the exercise of the option is premature because the same must 
be exercised only after the expiration of three (3) years from September
 10, 1976; and
  </p>
  <p>
    b)   the repurchase price of P14,941.76 is grossly inadequate.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, on March 9, 1977, petitioner filed an action for Specific 
Performance and Damages against respondent Justiniano Quirino, which 
case was docke­ted as Civil Case No. R-15972 of the Court of First 
Instance of Cebu, Branch III.
</p><p>
Answering the complaint, respondent, then defendant, claims that the 
Deed of Option to Repurchase is invalid because it was not notarized and
 even if it was valid, the right to repurchase can be exercised only 
after the three (3) year-period specified in the agreement.  Respondent 
further claims that the amount of P14,941.76 consigned with the Clerk of
 Court as the redemption money was inadequate.
</p><p>
After trial, the trial court rendered judgment, the dispositive portion of which reads -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, based on all the foregoing considerations, judgment is
 hereby rendered in favor of the defendant and against the plaintiff 
ORDERING: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "1. The dismissal of the complaint for lack of merit. </p>
    <p> "2. Plaintiff to pay defendant: - </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
          a)      P15,000.00 as loss of income from an agency of Hub Floral Company of Boston;
      </p>
      <p> b)      P20,000.00 as reimburse­ment for salaries of security 
Guards from March to December, 1977; and thereafter at P2,000.00 per 
month; </p>
      <p>
          c)      P10,000.00 as reasonable attorney's fees;
      </p>
      <p>
          d)      P100,000.00 in concept of moral and exemplary damages; and
      </p>
      <p> e)      P5,000.00 as reasonable expenses of litigation; and to pay the costs."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
From the aforesaid decision, petitioner appealed to the then Court of 
Appeals which docketed the appeal as CA-G.R. No. 64688-R.  In a decision
 promulgated on February 2, 1981, the said court affirmed <em>in toto</em> the decision of the trial court.
</p><p>
Petitioner now comes to US through the instant petition praying for the 
reversal of the assailed decision contending that the Court of Appeals 
erred in:
</p><p align="center">
I
</p><p align="center">
Holding that the petitioner can repurchase the property only after three (3) years;
</p><p align="center">
II
</p><p align="center">
Holding that petitioner cannot compel respondent to have the deed of option to repurchase reduced to a public document;
</p><p align="center">
III
</p><p align="center">
Holding that the deed of sale with assumption of mortgage is not 
supplemented by the deed of option to repurchase and that the former is 
not a necessary part and parcel of the latter;
</p><p align="center">
IV
</p><p align="center">
Holding that the consignation made by petitioner on February 22, 1977 in the sum of P14,941.76 is grossly ina­dequate;
</p><p align="center">
V
</p><p align="center">
Holding that even if the deed of option to repurchase is valid, the case
 would have to be dismissed as being premature as to time and inadequate
 as to consideration; and
</p><p align="center">
VI
</p><p align="center">
Denying petitioner's claim for damages and awarding instead excessive damages to respondent.
</p><p>
all of which assigned errors may be synthesized into the important issues of -
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    a)     When can petitioner exercise his option to repurchase the 
property in dispute, is it within three (3) years from the date of the 
execution of the deed as contended by petitioner or after three (3) 
years as decreed by the lower court; and
  </p>
  <p>
    b)     Are the damages awarded in favor of respondent justified.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The particular provision in the Deed of Option to Repurchase states - 
"that the option to repurchase shall be in force for a term of three (3)
 years from the date of the execution of said deed and failure for 
whatever reason, by the vendor to exercise his option to reacquire the 
property <em>within the stipulated period </em>shall automatically render the Deed of Option to Repurchase, without force and effect."
</p><p>
Interpreting the aforesaid provision, both the trial court and the Court
 of Appeals ruled that petitioner can exercise the option to repur­chase
 only after a period of three (3) years.  This is how the lower court 
and the Court of Appeals rationalized the said ruling -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x x plaintiff is a college drop-out, having completed second 
year commerce not just a simple farmer as he claims.  The Court takes 
note that the property in litigation is a hog farm and that plaintiff 
had previously obtained a Special Piggery Project Loan of P113,200.00 
which was ordered foreclosed by the Development Bank of the Philippines 
on June 29, 1976 for non-payment.  To avoid foreclosure, as he was being
 "pressed by the bank" plaintiff sold the property to defendant on 
September 10, 1976, under a "Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage" 
(Exh. B) which was to be effective upon the approval by the bank which 
came through in a 'Supplemental Deed of Sale’ (Exh. 1) signed by 
defendant on November 26, 1976 wherein the Bank imposed new terms and 
con­ditions which defendant was able to comply with only on December 10,
 1976, for which the title was issued to him, on December 15, 1976 (Exh.
 15).  Previous to this sale, plaintiff had leased the premises to 
defendant on January 30, 1976, for a term of two (2) years renewable for
 another two (2) years.  Defendant testified that under the lease, he 
brought into the piggery, 280 heads of imported hogs and expected to 
dispose of them in a period of two (2) to three (3) years but due to 
quarantine regulations brought on by the hoof and mouth disease he 
needed more time to dispose of his stock. </p>
  <p> "It would have been against reason for defendant to enter into an 
agreement with plaintiff that could terminate his occu­pancy in December
 1976, when his lease would not have expired until January 31, 1978, and
 after a renewable (sic) thereof, to January 21, 1980.  The reasons 
plaintiff gave to defendant that he needed that time (4 years) to find a
 place for his family and that if enriched by a 'sweepstakes prize' he 
would be able to redeem the property, indicated to defendant that 
plaintiff could not redeem the property at all. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Court is satisfied, therefore, that the intention of the parties was
 to give plaintiff, a gratuitous right to repurchase the property if he 
happened to be so fortunate at the end of three (3) years.  Neither 
party anticipated or expected or even imagined that this would be done 
suddenly two (2) weeks after approval of the Deed of Sale with 
Assumption of Mortgage or that the right could be exercised at anytime 
thereafter at the will of the plaintiff within the stipulated period of 
three (3) years.
</p><p>
If that were so, then plaintiff's plea for time to find another place 
for his family was a lie and defendant was grievously misled by 
plaintiff who concealed his intentions.  The word 'term’ employed by 
Atty. Mario Delgado to express the desires of the parties is underscored
 by the desperate situation of plaintiff and the sympathetic response of
 the defendant.  The latter's acceptance and understanding of the 
document as described above and in recognition of plaintiff's right is 
not inconsistent with its terms because redemption at the end of three 
(3) years still is, 'within the stipulated period'.  Plaintiffs alleged 
attempts every week in December 1976 even if credible, before demand, is
 outside the contractual intention and agreement of the parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
We agree with the aforequoted findings and conclusions of the lower 
court which was affirmed on appeal in the now assailed decision of the 
then Court of Appeals.
</p><p>
It is a basic and fundamental rule in the interpretation of contract 
that if the terms thereof are clear and leave no doubt as to the 
intention of the contracting parties, then the literal meaning of the 
stipulations shall control but when the words appear contrary to the 
evident intention of the parties, the latter shall pre­vail over the 
former.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  In order to judge the intention of the parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered.
</p><p>
Testifying on the facts and circumstances that support the real and true
 intent of the parties with respect to the three-year period of 
redemption, respondent Quirino stated substan­tially, as follows -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We had no agreement; we had no discussion about any repurchase at
 the time we submitted the proposal to the Bank on August 27; We did not
 have discussion; we did not have any agreement about any repurchase on 
10 September when we signed the Deed of Sale.  Several days after the 
10th plaintiff went to the house of Atty. Delgado and asked him to 
prepare a Deed of Repurchase.  So when Atty. Delgado came to the farm he
 said, "Why don't we give him the right to repurchase.  He wants a 
period of four (4) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> "I had no prior knowledge of plaintiff going to Atty. Delgado with
 the purpose of asking him to prepare a repuchase agree­ment; but 
sometime on December 1976 Atty. Delgado was at the farm and he asked me:
  "Did you not give the plaintiff a copy of the Deed of Sale?" So I 
said:  "Why?" And he said:  "The plaintiff went to his house to ask for a
 copy." So I said:  "Why should he want a copy when I just gave him a 
copy?" Then he related to me and only on that day did he re­late to me 
that the plaintiff was the one who went to his house to ask him to 
prepare the Deed of Option.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> "In reply to the statement of Atty. Delgado re plaintiff's desire 
to repurchase, I was agreeable.  I had no intention of remaining in Cebu
 forever.  So I said:  "I cannot agree to four (4) years.  I said:  I am
 agreeable to give him time up to three (3) years.  So the plaintiff was
 then explaining to me that he needed four (4) years in order to find a 
place to live with his family, that he even said that if fortune should 
smile at him and he wins sweepstakes prize he might be able to redeem 
the property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> "Concerning the repurchase agreement, plaintiff and I had a talk 
with Atty. Delgado, when Atty. Delgado said:  "Let us give him the right
 to repurchase." He (plaintiff) was present and that is why he said, to 
justify the period of four (4) years, that he wanted that much time to 
find a place for his family to live on.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> "Together with the preparation of the repurchase agreement, Atty. 
Delgado said:  "How about the house?" So I said:  "Let him stay in the 
house." So you prepare two docu­ments, one a Deed of Option to 
Repurchase and another, a Deed of Occupancy to remain in the premises 
for a period of three (3) years and the option was for a period of three
 (3) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> "It is not correct what plaintiff said that he had anytime within 
three (3) years to repurchase, he wanted the term longer than three 
years, and I was not agreeable to a repurchase in two weeks time or one 
(1) month's time because that involves me remaining in the premises, 
building the house in the premises, improving the area.  So to my mind, 
the period was at least three (3) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> "Sometime on 30 January 76, plaintiff and I talked again on this 
subject in our farm in the presence of my wife.  I told him then that 
under our agreement you wait for three (3) years.  That period is good 
for you as well as for me.  So after three (3) years or at the end of 
the three (3) years, let us talk about it.  I don't remember his reply 
anymore.  He left off and a few days after that I went to Manila.  When I
 got back on 22 Feb. 77, plaintiff's letter, Exh. "D", written thru his 
counsel, was already in my house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Clearly then, from the said respondent's testimony which stand 
unrebutted, what petitioner wanted was to exercise the option at the 
expiration of four (4) years and what the respondent agreed to was for 
petitioner to exercise the op­tion at the end of three (3) years.
</p><p>
This must be so because at that time, respondent was occupying the 
property in question as a lessee of the petitioner for a period of two 
(2) years from January 31, 1976, renewable for another period of two (2)
 years or up to January 31, 1980.  And, as such lessee, respondent had 
invested a substantial amount of money in connection with his business 
therein, which was the importation of livestock.  The evidence on record
 shows that in 1976, when the deed of sale and the option to repurchase 
were executed respondent had 280 heads of imported hogs which he figured
 out he will be able to dispose of only in a period of about three (3) 
years.  Therefore, respondent could not have agreed to a repurchase 
which may be done anytime within three (3) years from the execution of 
the deed.
</p><p>
Considering however that three (3) years had already elapsed since 
September 10, 1976 (execution of the Deed of Repurchase) the foregoing 
discussion is now rendered academic and there is no more any legal 
impediment to the exercise of the said right by the herein petitioner.
</p><p>
We now come to the question of damages.  The award of P15,000.00 for 
loss of income and P20,000.00 as reimbursement for salaries of security 
guards should be eliminated.  The alleged loss of income is not 
recoverable for being speculative.  No receipts or any kind of evidence 
on the matter was presented to prove the same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</p><p>
As to the award of moral damages, while We find them to be justly due under the factual milieu,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  however, We consider the sum of P100,000.00 excessive.  The same must therefore be reduced to P10,000.00.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the judgment of the 
then Court of Appeals (now Intermediate Appellate Court) is MODIFIED by 
(1) eliminating the award of P15,000.00 for loss of income; and 
P20,000.00 as reimbursement for salaries; and (2) reducing the adjudged 
moral damages from P100,000.00 to P10,000.00.  Except as thus modified 
the appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED in all respect.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos,</em> and <em>Escolin, JJ., </em>concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, J., (Chairman,)</em> concurred with the dissent of <em>J. Aquino.
</em>
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, J.,</em> dissents. The petitioner should be allowed to 
repurchase the disputed piggery farm.  He exercised his option to 
repurchase on February 8, 1977 or within three years from September 10, 
1976, the stipulated term.  The view that the option could be exercised 
after three years is manifestly absurd.
</p><p>
Votes to reverse the decision of the trial court and the Appellate Court
 and to grant petitioner’s prayer in his complaint of March 4, 1977.
