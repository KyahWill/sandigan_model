<p class="BODY">After answer was filed by NAESS denying liability on the ground
that Pablo Dublin had taken his own life and that suicide was not compensable
under the Agreement invoked, the parties agreed to submit the case for decision
on the basis of position papers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, the POEA rendered judgment for the complainant, holding <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city>'s
death compensable under said Special Agreement and ordering NAESS to pay
complainant and her child compensation benefits <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
US$31,962.00 and her attorneys of record fees amounting to US$3,196.00, or the
equivalents of said sums in Philippine pesos at prevailing rates of exchange.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">NAESS filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was referred to the National
Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and was treated by the latter as an appeal
which it dismissed for lack of merit, with an express <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the POEA decision.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
NAESS thereupon came to this Court on a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>,
charging grave abuse of discretion and/or lack or excess of jurisdiction in
both the rendition and the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of judgment of
the POEA and raising <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>sole
issue of "*** whether death caused by suicide (jumping overboard) is
compensable</u>.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">NAESS argues the thesis <u>that suicide is not compensable under
the employment contract of Pablo Dublin because said agreement did not
constitute it the insurer of Dublin's life; that to allow the payment of death
benefits in the particular circumstances of this case would amount to paying a
price or reward for murder; and that the NLRC incurred in serious error in
finding that there was no conclusive proof </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dublin had intentionally
killed </span>himself</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At first blush these arguments would seem to possess some
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They fail, however, to stand
closer scrutiny.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no question
that NAESS freely bound itself to a contract which on its face makes it
unqualifiedly liable to pay compensation benefits for <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city>'s
death while in its service, regardless of whether or not it intended to make
itself the insurer, in the legal sense, of <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city>'s
life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No law or rule has been cited
which would make it illegal for an employer to assume such obligation in favor
of his or its employee in their contract of employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attention of the Court has been invited to the fact that the
agreement in question also provides for payment of disability benefits,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
but that in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contrast to compensation
for death the right to such benefits is conditioned on lack of fault on the
part of the employee concerned for the accident causing disability, thus
evincing an intent to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">treat </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the two classes of benefits differently.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, it is likewise suggested, militates
against reading into the provision for death benefits <span class="SpellE">conditionalities</span>
not explicitly stated therein; and, indeed, it does, because it is only logical
to assume that if it had been intended to subject NAESS' liability for death
benefits to any condition, such as one barring compensation for death by the
employee's own hand, whether intentional or otherwise, the contract would have
specifically so provided, just as it did in incorporating the lack-of-fault <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">proviso</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> </span>in the disability benefits clause referred to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">"***.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, contracts, *** which are the
private laws of the contracting parties, should be fulfilled according to the
literal sense of their stipulations, if their terms are clear and leave no room
for doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties, for<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> contracts are obligatory, no matter what
their form may be, whenever the essential requisites for their validity are

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">"To </span>start with,
a few basic principles on the interpretation of contracts should be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reiterated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

its </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">literal meaning </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">shall control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1372 of the New Civil Code further

understood to comprehend things that are distinct and cases that are different
from those upon which the parties intended to agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

expressed or an interpretation which would alter its strict and literal
significance should not be given </span>to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the entirety of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contract
must be taken into consideration to ascertain the meaning of its provisions.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">n view </span>of what has
already been stated, it makes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">no </span>difference
whether Dublin intentionally took his own life, or<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>he killed himself in a moment of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">temporary aberration </span>triggered by remorse over the killing of the

may be noted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">parenthetically </span>that
these conjectures sound equally plausible because the events surrounding the death
of <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">have </span>not been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">established
</span>with any degree of certitude.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
already observed, this case was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">submitted
</span>to the POEA for decision on the basis of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">position </span>papers only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Testimony as to the circumstances of the two deaths on board the MV DYVI<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>PACIFIC, though presumably available,
was never presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, NAESS
in its position paper adverted to certain declarations of crewmen on the matter
supposedly "*** culled from the Official Report of the Master of the
vessel ***" but the POEA was furnished only a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copy of that document.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Proof of this kind, if it may be called such, which at best is at least twice
removed from its primary source, cannot be accepted as indubitably establishing
the context within which <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city>'s
death should be viewed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The POEA and the
NLRC had every reason to declare that there was lack of conclusive or credible
proof that <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city> intentionally
took his own life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any case, this
Court is not prepared to rule that a contract contravenes public policy and is
therefore void which, by not specifically excepting suicide in a clause
obligating one of the parties to pay compensation for the death of the other,
may in theory enable the latter's estate, or his heirs, to profit from his
self-immolation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also argued that to compel payment of death benefits in
this case would amount not only to rewarding the act of murder or homicide, but
also inequitably to placing on NAESS the twin burdens of compensating both the
killer and his victim, who allegedly had also been employed under a contract
with a similar death benefits clause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This argument, in confusing the legal implications and effects of two
distinct and independent agreements, carries within itself the seeds of its own
refutation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city>'s
part, entitlement to death benefits resulted from his death while serving out
his contract of employment; it was not a consequence of his killing of the
second cook, Rodolfo Fernandez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
latter's death is also compensable, that is due to the solitary fact of his
death while covered by a similar contract, not precisely to the fact that he
met death at the hands of <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That both deaths may be related by cause and
effect and NAESS is the single obligor liable for compensation in both cases
must, insofar as the factual and legal bases of such liability is concerned, be
regarded as purely accidental circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>NAESS would have had no reason whatsoever to introduce into the present
dispute the matter of compensation benefits for Fernandez had Dublin, after
killing Fernandez, succumbed to a stroke or a heart attack instead of allegedly
taking his own life, because the contract of Fernandez, if the same as that of
Dublin as regards death benefits, would unquestionably cover death by murder or
misadventure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There would still be no
reason to do so, that is, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">relate the
killing of Fernandez to the present </span>compensation claim, merely on the
assertion, even if <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">true, </span>that <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city>
had committed suicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The further claim that payment of death benefits would be
premature because, Dublin's body <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">never
having been </span>actually recovered, he can only be considered missing, must
be rejected, and not only because it so openly conflicts with NAESS’ insistence
that he committed suicide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court has
no doubt, from such of the circumstances of the night of <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1983</st1:date> as to which the parties offer no
dispute, that <st1:city><st1:place>Dublin</st1:place></st1:city> in fact met
his death at that time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The award of attorney's fees, however, merits reconsideration and
must be set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has not been made
to appear that the contract of employment sued upon incorporates any
stipulation for payment of attorney's fees in case of breach thereof and the
injured party is compelled to litigate for relief <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither does the record clearly show any
circumstance that would justify an award of such fees in the absence of
stipulation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>
