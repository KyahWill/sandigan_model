complied with their obligation to remove the 'encargado,' the plaintiffs, as
injured parties, may choose between the fulfillment of the contract of sale and
its rescission, in accordance and (sic) Article 1191 of the Civil Code.  They chose enforcement of the contract
which, however is legally impossible.  The lands sold to the plaintiff are agricultural, planted to coffee,
among other plants, not only by the 'encargado' but also by his deceased
parents.  The law prohibits, under pain
of damages, fine and imprisonment, a landlord from dispossessing his
agricultural tenant without the court's approval and on grounds fixed by the
law, not one of which is shown to exist in respect defendants' 'encargado.'

<blockquote>Impossible conditions, those contrary to good customs or public
policy and those prohibited by law shall annul the obligation which depends
upon them.  (Article 1183, Civil
Code).  Since the consummation of the
sale between the parties is dependent upon the ouster of an agricultural
lessee, which cannot be done because it is against good custom, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">public </span>policy and the law, the sale is

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In their petition,
Marcelino and Guadalupe Galang argued </span>that respondent Court erred in
ordering the rescission instead of specific performance of the contract of sale
on the ground that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the ejectment of the
"encargado"-tenant was a legally impossible </span>condition that
prevented the fulfillment of the contract.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Contrary to the reason advanced
by the Court of Appeals and the trial court, petitioners averred that the
removal of the </span>"encargado" was not a condition precedent to
the fulfillment of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">contract as
paragraph two (2) thereof provides for an alternative period within which
petitioners would have to pay the second 25% </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

and concomitantly, private respondents would deliver the owner's duplicate

private respondents would still have to deliver the duplicate title.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We are now confronted
with the question:  Was the removal </span>of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We answer in the
negative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

conditions, those contrary to good customs or public policy and those
prohibited by law shall annul the obligation which depends upon them.  x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Both courts declared the
"encargado" a tenant.  This
being the case, it follows that he may not be removed from the subject land
without just cause, as provided by Presidential Decree No. </span>1038.  Since the Galangs, then plaintiffs demanded
the removal of the "encargado" which, being legally impossible, could
not be me<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">t</span>, the contract of sale
was rescinded by the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We disagree with the
conclusion arrived at by the respondent court.  Reviewing the terms of the Deed of Sale quoted earlier, it is clear that
the parties had reached the stage of perfection of the contract of sale, there
being already "a meeting of the minds upon the thing which is the object
of the contract and upon the price,"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> and on the basis of which both </span>parties
had the personal right to reciprocally demand from the other the fulfillment of
their respective obligations.  But
contracts of sale may either be absolute or conditional.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> One
form of conditional sales, is what is now popularly termed as a "Contract
to Sell," where ownership or title is retained until the fulfillment of a
positive condition, normally the payment of the purchase price in the manner
agreed upon.  The breach of that
condition can prevent the obligation to convey title from acquiring a binding
force.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the condition is imposed, instead, upon the perfection of the contract,
the failure of such condition would prevent such perfection.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
What we have here is a contract to sell for it is the transfer of ownership,
not the perfection of the contract that was subjected to a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">condition.  Ownership was not to vest in the buyers until full payment of the
purchase price and the transfer of the title to the buyers.  Apart from full payment of the purchase
price, we find no other condition which would affect the obligations of the </span>parties,
i.e., to pay, on the part of the buyer and to convey ownership, on the part of
the seller.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The alleged condition
precedent, the removal of the "encargado," was simply an alternative
period for payment of the </span>second 25% of the purchase price given by the
seller to the buyer.  Assuming that the
removal of the "encargado" could not be brought about, the buyers,
petitioners herein, could have nonetheless demanded the delivery of the owner's
duplicate certificate of title by paying the second 25% of the sale price
within three months.  In this case, the
filing of the complaint for specific performance of the seller's obligation was
the root of the errors committed first, by the trial court and later, by the
Court of Appeals.  Both courts
overlooked the obvious fact that only the time for paying the second 25% of the
purchase price was qualified and that the entire paragraph reads:  "25% within three months <u>or</u> upon
removal of the "encargado" from the premises x x x" and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not simply </span>25% upon removal of the
"encargado."</p>

<p class="BODY">The case before us could have been resolved by the lower courts
without ruling on whether the "encargado" was a tenant or not.  Granting that it was necessary to rule on
the legal status of the "encargado," we find that the courts had been
quite precipitate in holding that the "encargado" was a tenant.  There was no sufficient evidence to support
that conclusion apart from the affidavits of the "encargado" and his
neighbor.  The conclusion of the Court
of Appeals regarding this matter rested <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on
</span>surmises.  It held:</p>

<blockquote>"We discern no reversible error in the finding and conclusion
of the trial court that the unnamed 'encargado' on the lands in question is
actually a tenant or agricultural lessee.  The bases of this ineluctable conclusion are not hard to see.  As succinctly pointed out by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, the 'encargado' is staying in his own existing house thereon, and
subject agricultural land is planted to coffee and other plants not only by the
‘encargado’ but also his deceased parents.  Indeed, if the 'encargado's’ parents were not tenants or agricultural
lessees, the present 'encargado' could not have continued occupying and working
thereon, without facing ejectment proceedings; considering that one of the
landowners, defendant-appellees here, is a lawyer himself.  In fact, as can be gleaned from the decision
under scrutiny, defendants-appellees filed a third-party complaint against the
'encargado' but they did not pursue such a course of action because they did
not have a clearance from the then Ministry, now the Department of Agrarian
Reform, to proceed against such 'encargado.' Then, too, if the said 'encargado'
did not have the status of a tenant or agricultural lessee entitled to
protection under the agrarian reform laws, he would not have been given the
attention and importance as to be brought before the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>twice, just for a possible amicable settlement, and he would not
have had the firmness to reject an offer for him to continue working half the
area under controversy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Equally supportive of the foregoing<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>opinion
are the following ratiocinations in Cruz v. Court of Appeals, L-50350, May 15,
1984, 129 SCRA 222:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x it is also undisputed that respondent lives on a hut
erected on the landholding.  This fully supports
the appellate court's conclusion, since only tenants are entitled to a homelot
where he can build his house thereon as an incident to this right as a
tenant."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:

x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Also, the Court is aware of the practice of landowners, by
way of evading the provisions of tenancy laws, to have their tenants sign
contracts or agreements intended to camouflage the real import of their
relationship."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">All </span>things <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">duly </span>considered, let alone the better
rule that all doubts vis-a-vis the status of a tiller of the soil should be
resolved in favor of tenancy, relationship.  We cannot help but conclude here that the 'encargado' on the landholding
deeded out in the deed of sale (Exhibit "A") is a tenant or agricultural
lessees within the purview and under the mantle protection of the Code of
Agrarian Reforms."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">To summarize, we hold
that there was no basis for rescinding the contract because the removal of the
"encargado" was not a condition precedent to the contract of
sale.  Rather, it was one of the
alternative periods for the payment of the second installment given by the
seller himself to the buyers.  Secondly,
</span>even granting that it was indeed a condition precedent rendering
necessary the determination of the legal status of the "encargado,"
the lower courts were rash in holding that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">"encargado" was a tenant of the land in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In view of the foregoing
circumstances, we are convinced </span>that specific performance by the parties
of their respective <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">obligations is
proper.  Accordingly, petitioners
Marcelino and Guadalupe Galang are ordered to pay private respondents the
second 25% of the purchase price.  Considering, however, the time that has lapsed since </span>the parties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">entered into the contract, payment of the
full balance, that is, 75% of the purchase price, P192,795.00 is in order.  However, the 12% interest per annum that was
stipulated in paragraph 3 of the contract of sale should not be assessed
against petitioners.  On the other hand,
private respondents Ramon Buenaventura, Angeles Buenaventura, Corazon Buenaventura,
and Maria Luisa Buenaventura are obliged to deliver the owner's duplicate
certificate of title and to transfer the </span>title to the land in question
upon payment of the purchase price by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Civil Code, private respondents are liable for damages
to the injured party, the petitioners in this case.  However, in lieu of actual payment of damages, and considering
the fact that private respondents were in possession of the land during the
entire period that this case was pending, private respondents are no longer
entitled to the interest payments which would have been due from petitioners.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
