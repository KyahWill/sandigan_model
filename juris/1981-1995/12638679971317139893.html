on <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1986</st1:date>, Lorenzo
Lara was sleeping in his residence at Zone 5 Signal Village, <span class="SpellE">Taguig</span>, Metro Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A knock at the door, awakened him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He stood up and opened the door, but he saw nobody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, to his surprise, someone entered the
house through the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> <span class="SpellE">Jambunganan</span> y <span class="SpellE">Hundana</span>, the owner of the house which Lara was occupying
for free, as a caretaker.</p>

<p class="BODY">Seeing Lara, <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> embraced him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Lara held <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span>,
he felt blood in the latter's clothes and sensed that he had wounds in his
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he asked <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span>
what happened, the latter replied, "<span class="SpellE">Tol</span>, <span class="SpellE">sinaksak</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>
<span class="SpellE">labas</span>." "Who stabbed you?" Lara
asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Tony, <span class="SpellE">Suay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ric</span> and Junior," he answered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> also
"shouted" twice, "Help me!" Frantically, Lara called out to
his neighbors for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neighbors came
running.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span>
was about to be placed on board a jeep, he collapsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was declared "DOA", dead on
arrival, at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Nichols</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Airbase</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> sustained three stab wounds at
the back and died of hemorrhage, severe, secondary to stab wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Prospero A. <span class="SpellE">Cabanayan</span>, a medical
specialist, and the medico-legal officer and in-charge of the clinical
application of medicine, of the National Bureau of Investigation, opined that
of these three wounds, all at the back, only one was fatal which alone could
have caused the death of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also testified that "(O)<span class="SpellE">ne</span> kind of single bladed
sharp pointed instrument produced the wounds," albeit he admitted that it
is possible that there could have been more than one instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next morning, on <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="10">October
 9, 1986</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight o'clock</st1:time>,
Lara reported the incident to the <span class="SpellE">Taguig</span> Police
Station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent investigation,
sloppily and <span class="SpellE">hapzardly</span> conducted by the police
authorities, resulted in the finding that <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> was
stabbed two meters away from a sari-sari store owned by Priscilla Flores,
married to a policeman of <span class="SpellE">Taguig</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Libis</span> St., Zone 5, Signal Village, <span class="SpellE">Taguig</span>,
Metro Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The store was about ten
meters away from <span class="SpellE">Nonito's</span> residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Drinking hard liquor was prevalent in that
store.</p>

<p class="BODY">Solely on the deductions or conclusions of Lara that the four
nicknames or aliases allegedly "whispered" by <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span>
to him correspond to Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span> for the nickname
or alias "Tony," "Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Mundido</span>"
for "Su-ay" or "<span class="SpellE">Suway</span>" (in his
direct testimony he said "<span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cahiwat</span>"), while on cross-examination he mentioned
"<span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mundido</span>,"
and Ricardo Ignacio for "<span class="SpellE">Ric</span>," and "<span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Henares</span>" or "<span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cahiwat</span>" for
"Junior," an information for murder was filed against the four <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> on October 14, 1986.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Only Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span> y <span class="SpellE">Mogallon</span> and Ricardo Ignacio were apprehended, as the other
two, "Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Mundido</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Henares</span>," were never
arrested, and remain at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ricardo Ignacio was only apprehended during a "saturation
drive‚Äù conducted by the military and police authorities on <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1987</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> He was acquitted on a demurrer to
evidence pursuant to the Resolution of the trial court dated <st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span>, the
appellant in the case at bar, consists of denial and alibi, and points to two
other persons--Mio <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> and a certain Miguel--as
the assailants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense before the trial court, Antonio, 31, married with
eight children, testified that he was at the time of the incident a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">tanod</span> of his <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>, and an upholsterer in the <span class="SpellE">Emaden</span>
furniture shop in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied that he knew the deceased and
averred that he had never met him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
narrated that he was inside his family residence at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Libis</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Purok</span>
15, Zone 5, <st1:place><st1:placename>Signal</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Taguig</span>, M.M. at <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="10">October
 8, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had not gone out
the whole day as he was taking care of his sick child in the absence of his
wife, Amelia, a Food Terminal, Inc. employee who was assigned to the night
shift.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, Lorenzo Lara and <span class="SpellE">Melly</span>
Castillo arrived at Antonio's house, demanding that Antonio reveal the
identities of the assailants (allegedly Antonio's <span class="SpellE">townmates</span>)
who had stabbed <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> to death the night
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio professed no knowledge
of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later that afternoon, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3
 o'clock</st1:time>, Lorenzo and <span class="SpellE">Melly</span> returned to
Antonio's house with Patrolwoman de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and Patrolman Amigo of the <span class="SpellE">Taguig</span> Police
Station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police officers, without
any warrant of arrest, took Antonio forcibly to the police precinct where he
was investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lara and <span class="SpellE">Melly</span> promised to release him from police custody if he
divulged the whereabouts of Mio <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> and Miguel,
and threatened to get back at him, if he would not, but since Antonio knew
nothing of the case, he made no disclosures.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three days later, while he was already in the municipal jail, Lara and <span class="SpellE">Melly</span> again went, for the third time to him and for the
third time tried to prevail upon him to reveal the whereabouts of the
assailants they suspected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Antonio's account on his whereabouts on the night of the stabbing
incident was corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> <span class="SpellE">Damanhog</span>, a faith healer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said that on <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="10">October 8,
 1986</st1:date>, she was summoned to treat Antonio's child who had a
fever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She arrived at Antonio's house in
the evening, and gave the child a "<span class="SpellE">pangtapal</span>"
and a lukewarm bath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To make sure that
the child's fever went down, she remained in Antonio's house until <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> after <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified with certainty that from <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1986</st1:date> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1986</st1:date>, Antonio stayed in
his house and never went out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
assured that she was there with him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another witness for the defense, <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>
Abe, 61, testified that on <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="10">October 8,
 1986</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="11">11:45</st1:time> in
the evening, she and her daughter, Evelyn, and their neighbors, <span class="SpellE">Caridad</span> and Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Irong</span>, were
returning to their respective houses after attending a prayer meeting for a
deceased person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Libis</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, they passed in
front of the store of Priscilla Flores, where they witnessed a person being
stabbed several times by Miguel, a person known to her, and another person whom
<span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> did not recognize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim fell down and was unable to
move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Frightened, the four women rushed
to their homes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Reynaldo de Paz, buyer of rejected meat from the
slaughter house in <span class="SpellE">Taguig</span>, dovetailed with the
recount of <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> Abe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo recalled that on October 8, 1986,
between 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock midnight, while passing by the sari-sari
store of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Floriza</span>
(referring to Priscilla Flores), he saw, from a distance of about ten meters, a
person being stabbed three times at the back by a certain Miguel, while Mio <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> stood looking on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span>
(referring to <span class="SpellE">Fortunata</span> Abe) and three other
companions were passing by.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another witness, Norberto <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span>, 32,
brother of the appellant, swore that on October 8, 1986, between 11 and 12
o'clock at night, while he was inside the house of his sister, <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Libis</span> St., Zone 5,
Signal Village, <span class="SpellE">Taguig</span>, M.M., Miguel knocked at the
door and sought permission to sleep in the house that night because, he said,
"<span class="SpellE">Nakadisgrasya</span> <span class="SpellE">siya</span>."
Norberto assented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miguel warned him not
to breathe a word about his sleeping in Norberto's sister's house to
anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Early the next morning, Miguel
left without saying where he was going.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next witness, Amelia <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span>, 33,
wife of the appellant, recalled that she was at work on the night of <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1986</st1:date>, leaving her sick
child in the care of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next morning, Lara and <span class="SpellE">Melly</span> went to her house to ask
her husband, Antonio, for Miguel's and Mio <span class="SpellE">Veloso's</span>
addresses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When her husband could not
tell them the desired information, Lara remarked, "<span class="SpellE">Sige</span>,
<span class="SpellE">ikaw</span> <span class="SpellE">rin</span> <span class="SpellE">pag</span> <span class="SpellE">hindi</span> mo <span class="SpellE">itinuro</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the witnesses for the defense did not convince
the trial court of the innocence of the accused-appellant, and, in a decision
dated June 28, 1989 rendered a verdict of conviction, sentencing Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span> to suffer the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> with all its accessory penalties, to indemnify the
heirs of victim <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> <span class="SpellE">Jambunganan</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Hundana</span> in the amount of P30,000.00 without
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span> y
<span class="SpellE">Magallon</span> submits the following assignment of errors.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">ASSIGNMENT</span></u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> <u>OF</u> <u>ERRORS</u> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in admitting the dying declaration of the
victim.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in convicting the accused-appellant of the
crime of murder based solely on the dying declaration of the victim without any
eyewitness presented in <span style="">court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in finding that in the case at bar,
conspiracy was sufficiently <span style="font-size: 12pt;">established by
evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in not giving weight and credence to the
accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lazarte's</span> claim or defense of alibi
and in disregarding the testimonies of defense <span style="">witnesses <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> <span class="SpellE">Dumanhug</span>
and Amelia <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">V</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in concluding that the prosecution has proven
the guilt of the accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Lazarte</span> beyond
reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the records of the case, it is clear that the conviction of
the appellant had been based largely on the alleged dying declaration of the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It behooves us therefore to
determine not only the admissibility, but also appreciate the weight of the
oral dying declaration of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> <span class="SpellE">Jambunganan</span> testified on by the principal witness for the
prosecution, Lorenzo Lara.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule a dying declaration is hearsay, and inadmissible in
evidence pursuant to the mandate of the Rules of Court, Rule 130, Section 30,
which states:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Testimony generally confined to personal
knowledge; hearsay excluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‚Äì A witness
can testify only to those facts which he knows of his own knowledge; that is,
which are derived from his own perception, except as otherwise provided in
these rules.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The above-quoted section of the Revised
Rules of Court expresses the hearsay rule in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there are several exceptions to this
rule on inadmissibility of hearsay evidence, the first one being a dying
declaration given under the circumstances specified in Section 31, likewise of
Rule 130, Revised Rules of Court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 31.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dying declaration. - The declaration of a
dying person, made under a consciousness of an impending death, may be received
in a criminal <span style="">case wherein his death is
the subject of inquiry, as evidence of the cause and surrounding circumstances
of such death.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in order that a dying declaration may be admissible as
evidence, four requisites must concur:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the declaration must concern the cause
and surrounding circumstances of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">declarant's</span></span><span style="">
death;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That at the time the declaration was made, the
<span class="SpellE">declarant</span> was under a consciousness of an impending
death;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
is competent as a witness; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the declaration is offered in a criminal
case for homicide, murder, or parricide, in which the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
is a victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Lara recalled that on the fateful night of <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1986</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span>,
who had multiple (5 according to him, 3 according to the NBI medico-legal
officer who also testified for the People), stab wounds, entered the house
through the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing Lara, <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span> embraced him and uttered the nicknames or aliases of
the persons who inflicted the injuries, thus:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Prosecution witness Lara under direct examination by Alberto S.
Lim)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What happened when he
entered thru the window?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time when he
entered thru the window he suddenly embraced me <span style="">and when I embraced him he said, "<span class="SpellE">Sinaksak</span>
<span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">labas</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
that, what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I asked him who stabbed
him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was his answer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I asked him the
question he <span style="">answered, "Tony,
Su-ay, <span class="SpellE">Ric</span> and </span>Junior".<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The quoted portion of the testimony of Lara may be accepted as
sufficient compliance with the first requisite<br>
above specified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it may be apt to
state that although a dying declaration may be made orally, that does not
militate against its admissibility.</p>

<blockquote>Dying declarations are not necessarily either written or
spoken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any method of communication
between mind and mind may be <span style="">adopted
that will develop the thought, as the pressure of the hand, a nod of the head
or a glance of the eye.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, a close scrutiny of Lara's testimony can not support, to
our mind, the finding of the trial court that the "victim was conscious of
his imminent death when he relayed the statement to Lorenzo Lara.‚Äù<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a>
This finding is gratuitous and has no clear basis in the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the words of the transcript are
already cold, they are nonetheless eloquent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let us examine them in full, even if we repeat portions already
hereinabove reproduced:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor did anyone attest to

the supposed dying declaration there is no evidence whatsoever in the records
of the case on the stabbing of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span>,
much less is there any testimony that the four accused ganged up on the
deceased victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, no
evidence has been adduced by the prosecution to establishing the participation
of Antonio in the alleged conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is there evidence on the involvement of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Mundido</span>

co-accused, Ricardo Ignacio, the one identified as the "<span class="SpellE">Ric</span>" in the ante mortem statements of <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span>, was discharged and acquitted by a mere demurrer to
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This grant in favor of the
appellant's co-accused, Ricardo, exposes the weakness of the evidentiary weight
of the ante mortem statements of <span class="SpellE">Nonito</span>.</p>

the victim or acted in conspiracy with the one(s) who killed him.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a></p>
