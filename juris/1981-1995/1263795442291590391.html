<p class="BODY"><span>The petitioners contend that the attorney's compensation 
provided for in the contract was neither fixed nor absolute but was contingent 
on the outcome of the final judgment.<span>&nbsp; </span>They maintain that "total 
claim" in paragraphs "a" and "b" of the contract should be construed in the 
context of the qualifying sentence "which shall be payable to you and may be 
collected from us anytime after </span><span>its </span><span>complete payment 
by the said defendants, either </span><span class="SpellE"><span>solidarily</span></span><span> or collectively".<span>&nbsp; 
</span>They also maintain that Atty. Gil de Guzman was dismissed for a 
justifiable cause and that the amount of attorney's compensation granted by the 
lower court was unconscionable and unreasonable.<span>&nbsp; </span>The petitioners 
submit that the compensation of Atty. de Guzman should be determined and fixed 
on the basis of <em>quantum meruit.</em><u></u></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Both Sections 24 and 26 of Rule 138 of the Revised Rules of 
Court cited by the parties apply to the case at bar.<span>&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 2, 
Section 26, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"A client may at any time dismiss his attorney or substitute another 
in his place, but if the contract between client and attorney has been reduced 
to writing and the dismissal of the attorney was without justifiable cause, he 
shall be entitled to recover from the client the full compensation stipulated in 
the contract.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the attorney may, in the discretion of the 
court, intervene in the case to protect his rights.<span>&nbsp; </span>For the 
payment of his compensation the attorney shall have a lien upon all judgments 
for the payment of money, and executions issued in pursuance of such judgment, 
rendered in the case wherein his services had been retained by the 
client."</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span>while</span></span><span> Section 24 
states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"An attorney shall be entitled to have and recover from his client 
no more than a reasonable compensation for his services, with a view to the 
importance of the subject matter of the controversy, the extent of the services 
rendered, and the professional standing of the attorney.<span>&nbsp; </span>No court 
shall be bound by the opinion of attorneys as expert witnesses as to the proper 
compensation, but may disregard such testimony and base its conclusion on its 
own professional knowledge.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>A written contract for services 
shall control the amount to be paid therefor unless found by the court to be 
unconscionable or unreasonable</em>." (Italics supplied)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The stipulation of attorney's compensation in a contract for 
professional services can be reduced by the courts if found unconscionable and 
unreasonable.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have explained this well-entrenched 
principle:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"'Contracts for attorney's services in this jurisdiction stand upon 
an entirely different footing from contracts for the payment of compensation for 
any other services.<span>&nbsp; </span>By express provision of section 29 of the Code 
of Civil Procedure, an attorney is not entitled in the absence of express 
contract to recover more than <span>a </span>reasonable compensation for his 
services; and even when an express contract is made the court can ignore it and 
limit the recovery to reasonable compensation if the amount of the stipulated 
fee is found by the court to be unreasonable.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a very 
different rule from that announced in section 1091 of the Civil Code with 
reference to the obligation of contracts in general, where it is said that such 
obligation has the force of law between the contracting parties.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE"><span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Since then this Court has invariably fixed counsel fees on a 
<em>quantum meruit</em> basis whenever the fees stipulated appear excessive, 
<span class="SpellE">unconsionable</span>, or unreasonable, because a lawyer is 
primarily a court officer charged with the duty of assisting the court in 
administering impartial justice between the parties, and hence, the fees should 
be subject to judicial control.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nor should it be ignored that 
sound public policy demands that courts disregard stipulations for counsel fees, 
whenever they appear to be a source of speculative profit at the expense of the 
debtor or mortgagor.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See, <span class="SpellE"><em>Gorospe</em></span><em>, et al. v. Gochangco,</em> L-12735,

Guzman as follows:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) P177<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> 
payable immediately and (2) 20% of whatever attorney's fees the petitioners may 
be awarded in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">SM-1208 as attorney's 
lien.</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Granting that the dismissal of Atty. Gil de Guzman was 
unjustified, it is obvious that, in the light of </span>the services rendered, 
the stipulation of attorney's fees in the contract for legal services becomes 
unconscionable and unreasonable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, we tend to agree with 
the petitioners that Atty. de Guzman was dismissed for a justifiable 
cause.<span>&nbsp; </span>The petitioners contend that Rolando <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> delivered to Atty. de Guzman the PNB checks in the 
amount of P852,000.00 issued by the MWSS as a result of <span>the writ of 
attachment </span><span>and ordered </span><span>them to </span><span>be 
deposited </span><span>with </span>the municipal treasurer of Sta. Maria, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; that after three months, Atty. de Guzman had not 
delivered said checks so that <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> decided to take 
the checks and deposit them himself but Atty. de Guzman denied halving the 
checks and refused to return them forcing the petitioners to dismiss him.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This assertion is given credence considering the explanation of the 
petitioners which is borne out <span>by </span>the records, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [T]hat 
after claiming that he 'never and did not receive said checks nor (had them) in 
<span>his </span>possession', he finally admitted having possession thereof with 
a ludicrous explanation of such possession in his motion dated April 18, 1983 
above quoted wherein he alleged that:<span>&nbsp; </span>'On April 11, 1983, about 
4:00 p.m., plaintiff Rolando <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> came to the office 
of the undersigned counsel and admitted his fault and turned over PNB Checks 
Nos. 070925 and 070928 both dated December 20, 1982 in the total sum of 
P852,000.00 in the name of Rolando <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> as plaintiff 
and attorney-in-fact which are now in counsel's possession and custody', after 
Atty. Alonzo had filed on April 14, 1983 a motion to declare him in contempt of 
court for denying and refusing to hand over said checks for deposit pursuant to 
the court's order of December 15, 1983.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent Atty. de 
Guzman's concocted claim that Rolando <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> turned 
over the said checks to him on <st1:date year="1983" day="11" month="4">April 
11, 1983</st1:date> is patently incredible because it is preposterous and 
utterly untrue, but typically characteristic of his dealings with petitioners as 
clients.<span>&nbsp; </span>If petitioner Rolando <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span> 
had the checks and he and his new counsel had been demanding that respondent 
Atty. de Guzman hand over said checks in his possession to them so the same can 
be deposited in compliance with the court's order and had dismissed him for 
refusing to do so, why will he (Rolando <span class="SpellE">Gimeno</span>) 
suddenly turn over the checks to respondent Atty. de Guzman who is no longer his 
lawyer?<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

the services rendered; the responsibility imposed; the amount of money or the 
value of the property affected by the controversy, or involved in the 
employment; the skill and experience called for in the performance of the 
service; the professional standing of the attorney; the results secured; and 
whether or not the fee is contingent or absolute, it being a recognized rule

Atty. de Guzman filed the complaint, had the defendants Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Socea</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonna</span> declared in default and finally, on his motion, the 
lower court issued the writ of attachment against MWSS.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the

pre-trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Nothing in the case so far appears complicated and no extra 
ordinary skill was needed for Atty. de Guzman to accomplish what he had done in

at that point how much the petitioners would recover or whether they would even 
recover anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
