				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Charged with violation of Section 15, Article III, Republic Act
No. 6425, The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended, in an Information
reading :</p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 26th day of August, 1992, in Quezon City,
Metro Manila, Philippines, the said accused, without any authority of law, did,
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously give, sell and deliver
0.18 gram of methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu), a regulated drug, worth
P700.00, Philippine Currency, to P02 RODELIO RECTO PNP, who acted as poseur
buyer, in violation of the aforesaid law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 5, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">accused, upon arraignment, pleaded not
guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <u>a quo</u> found him guilty as charged
in a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered finding Alejandro Mendiola
y de la Cruz GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as a principal for the crime of
Violation of Section 15, R.A. 6425, also known as the Dangerous Drugs Act, and
he is hereby sentenced to a jail term of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of
P25,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 17, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant appealed, contending that the trial court
erred:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In giving credence to the testimony of the
prosecution that there was a real buy-bust operation instead of a frame-up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In convicting accused-appellant despite
failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 32, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's version was synthesized by the trial judge, the
Honorable Jaime N. Salazar, Jr., in the following manner, which was adopted and
quoted by the Solicitor General in his brief:</p>

<blockquote>In the testimony of PO2 Rodelio Recto he identified the accused as
the person from whom he got a small packet containing crystalline granules for
P700.00 at the corner of Abbey Road and Sanyo Road, Bagbag, Novaliches, Quezon
City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PO2 Recto was assigned to act as the poseur-buyer by his subÂ­station
commander (Sub-station 2, Sangandaan, Novaliches, Quezon City) in a police
entrapment job.  He used the underworld
of drugs code words 'Pa-score ng bato' in offering to buy from the accused.  When the latter received the seven (7) one
hundred peso marked bills and put out his hand over to PO2 Recto, he
immediately grabbed the hand of the accused who offered some resistance.  When the palm of Alejandro was forced open
it showed a small plastic packet with white crystals inside.  (Exh. 'G')</blockquote>

<blockquote>The said packet was submitted to the crime laboratory of PNP for
examination.  Forensic Chemist Tita
Advincula testified that the granules found inside the said packet (Exh. 'G')
is positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or 'shabu'").</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 3-4, Appellee's Brief;
p. 82, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, accused-appellant's version of the case is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>. . . According to the accused-appellant, in the morning of August
26, 1992, he was at his house at G-60 Abbey Road, Novaliches, Quezon City
taking care of his pigs (p. 7, TSN, Dec. 1,1992).  At around 2 in the afternoon, Danding Coronel arrived at his
house and invited the accused to act as "Kristo" in a cockfight at
Sta. Quiteria, Sangandaan.  Since he had
known Danding Coronel since 1982, he acceded to his invitation and immediately
proceeded to the cockpit arena.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the two were nearing the cockpit arena, Danding Coronel told
the accused that they will first pass by a police station in Sangandaan <span style="">(pp. 14-15, TSN, </span>Dec. 1, 1992).  When they arrived at the police station,
Danding Coronel went inside the room and accused was left in front of the desk
officer (p. 16, TSN, Dec. 1, 1992).  After twenty minutes, Danding Coronel went out and told the accused that
he will just buy cigarettes downstairs.  Since then, Danding never returned and accused-appellant never saw him
anymore.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since Danding Coronel never returned, he tried to leave the police
station.  But he was prevented from
leaving the said station by a policeman named Isorena (p. 20, TSN, Dec. 1,
1992).  Accused-appellant inquired why
he was not allowed to leave and according to Isorena he was "palit
ulo" for Danding Coronel who had left him behind.  From that time on, he was detained and was
accused of selling shabu.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 34-35, <span style="">Rollo.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A thorough examination of the record leads to the unavoidable
conclusion that the evidence fails to sustain the conviction of
accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the severity of the penalty imposable for drug
offenses, courts must exercise extra vigilance in trying drug cases lest an
innocent person may be unduly convicted and made to suffer a long prison term
or even sentenced to death <span style="">(<u>People
vs. Alen</u>, </span><span style="">145 SCRA </span>50
[1986]; <u><span style="">People vs. William</span></u><span style="">, </span>209 SCRA 808 [1992]).  Of course, with the passage of Republic Act
No. 7659, the penalty for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act now depends on
the quantity of the prohibited drug involved.  Still and all, courts must exert utmost scrupulousness in evaluating the
evidence of the prosecution for it is elementary that the conviction of an
accused must rest on the strength of the prosecution and not on the weakness of
the defense (<u>People vs. Cruz</u>, 215 SCRA 339 [1992]).  The prosecution must overcome the
constitutional presumption of innocence by proof beyond reasonable doubt; otherwise,
the acquittal of the accused is ineluctably demanded.  It is upon the premise that the accused-appellant's guilt has not
been shown beyond reasonable doubt that we now decide this case instead of
referring it to the Court of Appeals for disposition which referral may just
result in the delay of the release of accused-appellant who has been detained
since August, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">In all prosecutions for violation of The Dangerous Drugs Act, the
existence of the dangerous drug (the shabu in this case) is a <u>sine qua non</u>
for conviction.  The dangerous drug is
the very <u>corpus delicti</u> of the crime of violation of The Dangerous Drugs
Act (<u>People vs. Macato</u>, 176 SCRA 762 [1989]; <u>People vs. Vocente</u>,
188 SCRA 100 [1990]; <u>People vs. Mariano</u>, 191 SCRA 136 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Examining the evidence for the prosecution, we find that the
prosecution's evidence on the identification of the shabu allegedly seized <span style="">from </span>accused-appellant is demonstrably
weak, unreliable, and unconvincing.  Prosecution witnesses clearly failed to identify the shabu (Exhibit G)
presented in court as the very shabu allegedly seized from
accused-appellant.  Per testimony of P02
Rodelio Recto, the alleged poseur-buyer, he did not place any identifying mark
or his initials on the packet of shabu he allegedly bought or seized from
accused-appellant and that it was the investigator, Sotero G. Basilio, who
affixed <span style="">his signature on the </span>packet.  Recto testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now
you mentioned the word initial, did you affix your initial there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
sir, our investigator has initial there, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
investigator is the <span style="">one who affix the
initial?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.  Yes sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY.
CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was you were the one turn over to him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
about you, you did not affix your initial here?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
the duty of the investigator is to give it to the laboratory, to <span style="">bring that to the laboratory and to sign </span>that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
actually, from whom or who actually recovered this one, this specimen, from the
accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am the one sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
that is what you said, it cost P700.00 am I correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
you said it was the investigator who indicated this initial whose initial is
this do you know?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.G.B.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
is that SGB stands for?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sotero
G. Basilio.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.  Was that SGB found there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Is that SGB (Counsel
referring to the initial in Exh. G for the prosecution)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Manifestation your
Honor, there is no such thing as SGB initial found in this plastic transparent
bag contain of this specimen, that will be all, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 3-16, tsn, Oct. 6,
1992.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, when Sotero G. Basilio, the investigator, was called to
the witness stand, he testified that he could not find his initials on the
plastic bag of shabu (Exhibit G) submitted in court.  He thus testified:</p>

<blockquote>FIS. PONFERRADA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
am showing to <span style="">you </span>this plastic
transparent bag, please examine this and tell us what relation is that to the
evidence presented to you during the investigation, that was already marked as
Exh. G?</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Witness is trying to
examine the specimen try to find out if there is <span style="">marking there.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am not sure if this was the one presented to <span style="">me </span>because I remember I wrote my signature on a plastic bag, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FIS. PONFERRADA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you find your signature there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have no signature,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 24-25, tsn, Oct. 6, 1992.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above declarations, ungrammatical as they may be, amply
demonstrate the inability of the investigator to positively and categorically
identify the shabu presented in court as the very shabu sold by or seized from
accused-appellant.  Withal, the
prosecution has failed to prove the indispensable element of <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u>
of the crime, which deficiency engenders in the mind of the Court serious
doubts as to the guilt of accused-appellant.  The constitutional presumption of innocence has thus not been overcome
by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still in fractured fashion, the prosecution attempted through
Investigator Sotero G. Basilio to establish that the plastic bag of shabu
(Exhibit G) is similar to the shabu seized from accused-appellant.</p>

<blockquote>FISCAL PONFERRADA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please
examine this and tell us how to compare, what is the relation of that and tell
the court the description of that thing given to you during the investigation
and that Exh. G now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. CEDILLO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Well your Honor, with
the sub-answer, he is not sure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FIS. PONFERRADA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please
examine the same?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
is similar thing to the evidence which presented to me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FIS. PONFERRADA:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you said similar, what do you mean by that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarity
of the plastic bag and the contents like the suspected shabu which <span style="">was recovered.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>( pp. 26-27, tsn, Oct. 6, 1992.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering that in criminal cases, proof beyond reasonable doubt
is required to establish the guilt of an accused, similarity in identifying the
<u><span style="">corpus</span></u><span style=""> <u>delicti</u></span> is insufficient;
unwavering exactitude in identification is necessary.  Every fact necessary to constitute the crime must be established
by proof beyond reasonable doubt <span style="">(<u>People
vs. Garcia</u>, </span>215 SCRA 349 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing findings, there is no need to discuss
the other assigned errors raised by accused-appellant.  However, we wish to state that, on account
of the weakness of the prosecution evidence, the alibi of accused-appellant
that on the morning of August 26, 1992 up to 1 p.m. of that day he was in his
house (the buy-bust operation allegedly took place at around 11 p.m. of August
26, 1992), assumes weight and significance (<u>People vs. Jalon</u>, 215 SCRA
680 [1992]).  His alibi is corroborated
not only by his wife and brother but also by Eusebio Agapito (p. 9, t.s.n.,
November 9, 1992) and Sofia Fernando (p. 27, November 9, 1992), who are totally
unrelated to him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">,<b> </b></span>the decision of the trial court
is hereby REVERSED and accused-appellant is hereby ACQUITTED.<b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
