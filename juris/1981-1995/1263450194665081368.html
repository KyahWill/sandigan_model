				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Claudio <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> appealed from the decision dated September 28, 1973
of the Court of First Instance of South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
General Santos City Branch I, convicting him of eight complex crimes of
forcible abduction with rape, sentencing him to eight penalties of </span><u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> <span style="">and
ordering him to pay the victim, <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> <span class="SpellE">Segapo</span>, a total indemnity (including attorney's fees) of
P130<span class="GramE">,000</span> (Criminal Case No. 559).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In that same decision,
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span> was convicted as an accomplice and
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of four years, two months and one day of </span><span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
<span style="">as minimum to ten years and one day of </span><span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> <span style="">as maximum and to pay the same indemnity to <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this Court's
resolution of </span><st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="2"><span style="">February 1, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Laurecio's</span>
petition to withdraw his appeal was granted (p. 183, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="12">December
 5, 1972</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> <span class="SpellE">Segapo</span>,
14, and her sister, <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>, 8 (both <span class="SpellE">Bilaans</span>),
left their house at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Landan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, <st1:place>South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place>,
to perform an errand for their father.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After walking for about forty minutes, they boarded a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and arrived in <span style="">the public market of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">General</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Santos</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> at around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six <span style="">o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the evening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Their destination was Barrio <span class="SpellE">Kiblat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malungon</span>, <st1:place><span class="GramE">South</span> <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place> where they were going to collect an
account from a person named <span class="SpellE">Tamigo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as there was no more <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
going to <span class="SpellE">Malungon</span> at that hour, the sisters decided
to take a tricycle to convey them to the house of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Mula</span>,
their relative residing at Laurel Street in that city.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the two girls could ride in a tricycle, Claudio <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>, a 35-year-old married man with five children, appeared
at the market place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was well-known
to the two sisters because, as an only son, he administered his family lands in
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Landan</span> where many <span class="SpellE">Bilaans</span>
resided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
alighted from his jeep, pointed his gun at the two sisters, held <span class="SpellE">Delena's</span> neck and forced her and her sister to board his
jeep.</p>

<p class="BODY">He conducted them to the New Bay View Hotel in the city where <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> forced them to enter Room 304.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was still holding his gun with one hand
and with his other hand, he held <span class="SpellE">Delena's</span> arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He threatened to kill the two sisters if they
would escape and refuse to enter the hotel room.</p>

<p class="BODY">After they had entered the room, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
locked the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He removed <span class="SpellE">Delena's</span> jeans and panties and pushed her to one of the
beds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He undressed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>, was on
the bed, he stripped her of her blouse and bra and placed himself on top of
her.</p>

<p class="BODY">She resisted, spitting at him and kicking and scratching
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her sister, <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>,
was also in tears, a helpless spectator of the ravishment being committed
against <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> spread <span class="SpellE">Delena's</span>
legs, inserted his penis into her vagina and made push-and-pull movements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He succeeded in having sexual congress with
her.</p>

<p class="BODY">After satisfying his <span style="">lust,
</span><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> went out of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took the precaution of locking it to
prevent the two sisters from escaping.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He obtained food from the restaurant on the ground floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reentered the room with the food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delena</span> refused to
eat.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> had sexual intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> eight times in the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She suffered pain in her genital organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <span style="">bleeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six
 <span style="">o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> </span>in <span style="">the </span>afternoon of <span style="">the
following </span>day, December 6, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> and the two
sisters left the hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He brought them
in his jeep to his parents' bungalow in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Landan</span>
which was then <span style="">unoccupied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They were locked in a room, <span class="SpellE">Fonso</span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span>, a houseboy </span>armed with a gun, guarded
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
had sexual intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> in that place.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 31, 1972,
while <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> </span><span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> were taking </span><span style="">lunch, the eight-year-old <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
(who had already been detained for twenty-six days) was able to escape by
passing through the ceiling and holding on to the pipe which led to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not take the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She traversed the savanna with cogon grass
and followed the creek leading to her house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nena</span> recounted the outrage to her
mother, Maria <span class="SpellE">Malid</span>, and later to her father, <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span> <span class="SpellE">Segapo</span>, when he arrived on
<st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1973</st1:date> from <span class="SpellE">Malungon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dalama</span> reported the incident to Lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Torcuator</span> of the city police department who, instead of
taking direct action, advised <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span> to complain to
the barrio captain who in turn told <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span> to ask
Rudy Ante, a barrio councilor, to accompany him to <span class="SpellE">Bulaong's</span>
house.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1973</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Dalama</span> and Ante repaired to <span class="SpellE">Bulaong's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dalama</span>
asked <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> to deliver to him his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span>, armed with a gun, brought <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>
to her father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dalama</span>
took her home.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two days later, or on January 8, the city health officer examined
<span class="SpellE">Delena</span> and found that there were recent multiple
lacerations in her hymen which admitted two fingers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He concluded that she was no longer a virgin
and that she was the victim of "recent sexual intercourse" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A Constabulary
investigator took the statements of <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span> and his
two daughters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="1"><span style="">January
 9, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, a complaint
for forcible abduction with rape, signed by <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span>, was filed in the city court against <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> as principal and <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span>
as an accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At past </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="16"><span style="">four o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> in the afternoon of that day, the city judge
interrogated <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The examination was reduced to writing in the form of searching
questions and answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day the
city judge conducted a similar examination of <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A warrant was issued for
the arrest of <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No bail was recommended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span> surrendered voluntarily on January 10 and </span>12,
<span style="">respectively (pp. 31 and 46,
Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They waived the preliminary
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="1"><span style="">January
 23, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, the city
fiscal filed in the Court of First Instance against <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span> <span class="GramE">an information</span>
for forcible abduction with rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
two accused entered a plea of not guilty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered the judgment of conviction
already stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this appeal, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> contends through his counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>that the lower court did not acquire
jurisdiction over the case because the information filed by the city fiscal is
fatally defective for not containing the verification required in Form 24 of
the Appendix to the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The forms prescribed in the Rules of Court "serve as mere
illustrations".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction over
the crime charged in this case is conferred by law, not by the complaint or
information which is merely the means by which jurisdiction is invoked or which
gives the court the occasion for exercising its jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Valdepeñas</span> vs.
People, 123 Phil. 734.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this case, the
complaint for abduction with rape against <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> was
filed in the city court by the offended girl and her father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That complaint was sworn to before the city
judge (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It</span> was the basis of the preliminary
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge examined the
witnesses under oath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examination
was reduced to writing in the form of searching questions and answers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of that examination, a warrant
of arrest was issued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The accused waived in
writing the second stage of the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the fiscal is not called upon
to conduct another preliminary investigation (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pervez</span>,
</span>110 <span style="">Phil. 214).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He could file <span class="GramE">an information</span> on the basis of the preliminary investigation
conducted by the inferior court because the prosecution of the offense is under
his direction and control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not
have certified that he held a preliminary investigation because the preliminary
examination was actually conducted by the city court and the second stage of
the preliminary investigation was waived by the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a case, like the
instant case, involving crimes against chastity, the prosecution may be
conducted by the fiscal on the basis of the complaint filed in the inferior
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no need to file <span class="GramE">an information</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Imas</span>, 64 Phil. 419; People vs.
Varela, 64 Phil. 1066; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, </span>60 <span style="">Phil. 1013; U. S. vs. Garcia, 27 Phil. 254;
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Zurbano</span>, L-32673, February </span>22, <span style="">1971, 37 SCRA 565.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the other
contention of the accused that the information should have been signed by the
offended girl is wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 344 of
the Revised Penal Code, reproduced in section 4, Rule110 of the Rules of Court,
does not require that the offended girl in a crime against chastity should sign
the information filed by the fiscal (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cerena</span>,
106 Phil. 570).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The accused contends that
the information dated </span><st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1"><span style="">January 22, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, which was filed on the following day,
January 23, is void because it was "received and filed on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="1"><span style="">January
 9, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">" and,
consequently, the case against the accused was "railroaded".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That contention is
baseless and preposterous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
information was filed on January 23, not on January 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, counsel <u>de</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">is
mistaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not examine the record
carefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another baseless
contention of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, which
shows his failure to peruse the record with due care, is that it is not alleged
in the information that the forcible abduction with rape was committed with
lewd design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incontestable fact is
that in both complaint and information "lewd </span>design" <span style="">is<b> </b>explicitly averred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio's</u></span> fifth
assignment of error is that the trial court erred in not finding that the
victim's father and accused <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> entered into a
compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel then argues that,
because of such a compromise, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> is not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is feeble and flimsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies quoted by counsel show that
the victim's father pretended to agree to a dowry of one <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
and two thousand pesos just to be able to secure the release of his daughter
who was held in captivity by <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
<span style="">was pardoned by the victim and her
father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the appropriate pardon
that extinguishes criminal liability for a crime against chastity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The other assignments of error of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> involve the issue of whether the crime of
forcible abduction with rape was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of that issue requires an
examination of <span class="SpellE">Bulaong's</span> evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>, who finished the third year
high school, set up the defense that <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> was his
mistress, who with her parents' consent, lived with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not deny that he cohabited with <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> in his father's house at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Landan</span>
from <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1972</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1973</st1:date> (896 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">He was infatuated with <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told her that he wanted her to be his
second wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He planned to ask his wife
to consent that <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> would be his mistress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that it was customary among the <span class="SpellE">Bilaans</span> to have a second wife.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
allegedly told <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> that he loved her, she replied
that she had liked him for a long time already (782).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(However, on cross- examination, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> said that he never told <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>
that he loved her, 8</span>55.)</p>

<p class="BODY">About the end of October, 1972, he informed <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span>
that he wanted <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> to be his second wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dalama</span> said that he
should talk with <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> allegedly became sweethearts on <st1:date year="1972" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1972</st1:date> while they were in the house
of <span class="SpellE">Palaguyan</span> <span class="SpellE">Lakim</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dalama's</span> neighbor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On that occasion <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> kissed <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> several times while they were seated on the floor
and he touched her private parts (883).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maria <span class="SpellE">Segapo</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
kissing <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> (857).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="11"><u>November 21, 1972</u></st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Segapo</span> told <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> that <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> wanted to
talk with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to <span class="SpellE">Delena's</span> house and stayed there from ten in the morning up
to <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one o'clock</st1:time> <span style="">in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allegedly agreed to have an assignation

buying a dress for her sister <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> (783-4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(On cross-examination, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
testified that it was <span class="SpellE">Dalama</span> who borrowed one hundred
pesos from him, 856).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nena</span> was to participate as a second
princess in the barrio fiesta to be held on November 24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Bulaong's</span> daughter

by <span class="SpellE">Bulaong's</span> wife who was operating a dress shop in
the city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nena</span>

November 21.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>

<p class="BODY">When the sisters arrived, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> brought them to <span class="SpellE">Satea's</span>
restaurant located on the ground floor of the New Bay View Hotel where they
took a <span class="SpellE"><u>merienda</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they had finished eating, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> directed <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> to take
the girls to Room 304 of the hotel.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> allegedly stayed with the two
girls in Room 304.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
slept in one bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> had sexual intercourse twice in the other

</span>She allegedly confessed that she had sexual relations with four men,
namely, Roberto Daniel, her cousins <span class="SpellE">Kamad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nonoy</span> and her uncle (911-913).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"One need not stretch his imagination to conclude that this
strange story of a love affair, followed by a demand of a dowry by the parents
accompanying their daughter, dismissed outright by the man, with the woman
choosing to remain in the house of her lover, a married man, still smiling and
professing to be in love with him, stayed willingly with him as a wife for
about a month and thereafter filing a case of forcible abduction with rape
against him, is very unusual and improbable, contrary as it is to human
experience, to deserve any modicum of credence (People vs. Alto, 26 SCRA 342,
357).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasons are:</blockquote>

testimonies and directly opposed to their story narrated in the direct evidence

their tender age (with respect to <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Segapo</span>) and his illiteracy

they stuck to their versions notwithstanding the long and searching

fulfilled it in that grand wedding of May 1, 1960 with Flora <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that

an eight-year old sister of <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Experience has taught us that sweethearts

pay the dowry in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>, she was
still happy and smiling, telling her parents that she would not leave his house

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ABAD <st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city>,
<i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mind cannot
rest easy that the appellant committed the crime of abduction with rape and I
base my doubts on the following:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The alleged abduction is said to have taken place
at the public market of <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="12">December
 5, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I take notice of
the fact that at that time of the day many persons are still in public markets
and yet neither <span class="SpellE">Delena</span> nor <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
shouted for help.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly the two sisters did not cry for
help when the appellant allegedly brought them to the New Bay View Hotel and
forced them to enter Room 304 while holding his gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant could not have pre-registered at the hotel for his
meeting with the girls was casual if we are to believe the evidence for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence he must have
registered when he arrived with the two girls.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that time the two girls had the opportunity to cry for help but they
remained silent.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the group left the hotel in <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for Barrio <span class="SpellE">Landan</span> the following day on board the
appellant's jeep, it is inconceivable that the girls had no opportunity to cry
for help during the long ride.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they
did not.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two girls were allegedly detained by the
appellant from <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="12">December 5 to 31, 1972</st1:date>,
until <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Segapo</span> was able
to escape on the latter date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I find it
equally inconceivable that neither of the two could have escaped during that
long period if there was a will to do so.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delena</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> left the family home on <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1972</st1:date>, and it was only on <st1:date year="1972" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1972</st1:date>, after <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
was supposed to have escaped from the appellant's bungalow when she returned
home to tell her mother what happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yet the parents did nothing to locate the two girls of tender age
who failed to return home over a long period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to <span class="SpellE">Delena</span>, it was only on <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1973</st1:date>, when her father was
said to have gone to the appellant's house to ask for her return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relaxed and nonchalant attitude of the
parents is incre­dible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a parent I
would have gotten excited and moved heaven and earth so to speak in order to
locate a missing child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the loss
of only a dog is sufficient to cause me concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the <span class="SpellE">Segapo</span>
parents appeared unconcerned and unaffected.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is supposed to have used a gun
when he committed the crime imputed to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where is the gun?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was never
presented during the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, Exhibit 11 shows that the appellant had transferred his Smith and
Wesson .22 caliber revolver to Charlie B. <span class="SpellE">Dimalanta</span> on
<st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit 11 was executed <u>ante</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>litis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>motam</u></span> and
deserves credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, on <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1972</st1:date>, the Martial Law
regime was relatively new and <span style="">it is </span>a
fact that during the early days of martial law the people were very obedient to
its strictures one of which was the prohibition against the carrying of
firearms even if licensed outside one's residence.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judge Pedro Samson C. Animas who convicted
the appellant describes him thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="">a </span>rich man's son whose parents
acquired and owned valuable properties not only in General Santos City, but
also in <span class="SpellE">Landan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>,
South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, where the family has a vast
agricultural land, a corn <span class="SpellE">sheller</span> and two residential
houses (one for his parents and another for him).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant as the only son, before his
incarceration, had been administering these properties in <span class="SpellE">Landan</span>,
populated mostly by <span class="SpellE">Bila-ans</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Awed and revered by the constituents, if not
feared, no public function moved in this remote place without the nod of this
oligarch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Schools were opened, roads
were constructed and all public improvements were materialized upon their <span class="SpellE">proddings</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For such
status of wealth amounted to control during the aegis of the old Society, determinative
of the result of any election, national and local, nay, even for barrio
officials."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I wonder if the good judge did not get carried away by his
rhetoric.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before us the appellant is
represented by a counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, not
<u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, and the tragedy of it is that
the appellant's counsel does not appear to possess the requisite competence to
handle the serious charge if we judge him on the basis of statements made in
the main opinion, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused contends that the information dated <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1973</st1:date>, which was filed on
the following day, January 23, is void because it was 'received and filed on <st1:date year="1973" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1973</st1:date>' and, consequently,
the case against the accused was 'railroaded'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That contention is baseless and preposterous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information was filed on January 23, not
on January 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> is mistaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not examine the record carefully.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another baseless contention of counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, which shows his failure to peruse the record
with due care, is that it is not alleged in the information that the forcible
abduction with rape was committed with lewd design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incontestable fact is that in both
complaint and information 'lewd design' is explicitly averred.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio's</u></span>
fifth assignment of error is that the trial court erred in not finding that the
victim's father and accused <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> entered into a
compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel then argues that,
because of such a compromise, <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span> is not guilty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The argument is feeble and flimsy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies quoted by counsel show that
the victim's father pretended to agree to a dowry of one <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>
and two thousand pesos just to be able to secure the release of his daughter
who was held in captivity by <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that <span class="SpellE">Bulaong</span>
<span style="">was </span>pardoned
by the victim and her father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
appropriate pardon that extinguishes criminal liability for a crime against
chastity."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I am not bothered by the
fact that in the decision dated September 28, 1973, the trial court found
Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span> guilty as an accomplice and
sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of 4 years, 2 months and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
as minimum and 10 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>
as maximum, and that on February 1, 1979, he was allowed to withdraw his
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span>
admit guilt thereby and by inference should we consider the appellant guilty
also because there can be no accomplice without a principal?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not necessarily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For if <span class="SpellE">Laurecio</span> had
not <span class="SpellE">witdrawn</span> his appeal, its resolution would have to
be linked to the resolution or the principal's appeal which is time
consuming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But by withdrawing his appeal
as he did, he immediately became eligible for parole and having served as a
member of the Board of Pardons and Parole for over eight years (not to mention
being its <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> chairman for a like
period), I will hazard the statement that he has long been released on parole.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the foregoing,
I vote to acquit on reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
