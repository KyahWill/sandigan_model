<p class="BODY">The money claims of workers pose a special problem of jurisdiction
when liquidation proceedings are on-going because of the highly preferred
nature given by law to said claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">In these cases, however, the problem poses no particular
difficulty because the workers themselves have voluntarily opted to participate
in the liquidation proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
representatives in the MOA Liquidation Committee participated in the
discussions and proceedings which led to the orders to distribute payments to
the various claimants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The workers
themselves oppose the orders of the NLRC which have denied them the speedy
receipt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>funds they urgently
need.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a grave abuse of discretion
on the part of NLRC to raise a technical question of its own jurisdiction when
the workers over whom it is raised reject the assertion of that
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC has allowed only
25 out of 7,124 employees and a former counsel trying to claim alleged unpaid
fees to delay the immediate payment of the workers’ claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the Solicitor General's submission that the money
claims of Stanford's former employees pending with respondent Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> M. Cruz should be allowed to continue and that
the money awards <span class="GramE">be</span> later presented to the Stanford
Liquidation Committee is not the correct solution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would only spawn needless controversy,
delays, and confusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
the money claims were presented after Stanford filed a petition for suspension
of payments and appointment of a rehabilitation receiver with the SEC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the money claims were filed
when Stanford was already experiencing financial difficulties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, the employees filed the cases to
enforce money claims which they might not collect in view of Stanford's
financial crisis and impending closure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under these circumstances, and bearing in mind the welfare of the
workers and their voluntary choices as to how their claims may be equitably
settled to their satisfaction, we rule that such money claims were correctly
submitted in the course of the liquidation proceedings at the SEC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners themselves (the former employees who were
complainants in the money claims cases pending with the different labor
arbiters including those with respondent Labor Arbiter Cruz except for the
twenty-five private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">respondents </span>represented

jurisdiction of the SEC." (Petition, p. 77)</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the petitioners point out that all the other labor
arbiters except for the respondent Labor Arbiter granted the motion to stay
proceedings in the money claims pending before them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Labor Arbiter Cruz was assigned to
handle five (5) consolidated money claims affecting 3,244 former Stanford
employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With this group, were former
employees represented by <span class="SpellE">Ludivina</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Sabalza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Adeliza</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Cantillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Remigio</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Pestaño</span> who initially hired the services of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,

action were tolerated, ‘no<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>employer

<blockquote>"The record of the case clearly discloses that the private
respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lerum</span> was primarily responsible for
negotiating for the PALEA the retroactive wage increases mentioned earlier, to
the exclusion of petitioner Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PAL could validly deal with the <span class="SpellE">Biangco</span> Faction represented by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lerum</span>
because no court order had been issued restraining PAL from doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record of the case also reveals that
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> tried his best to enjoin the
negotiations initiated by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lerum</span> by questioning
the same before the Court of Industrial Relations and even this Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the basis of the foregoing observations, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot see how Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> could be entitled to any
part of the said attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
attorney's fees emanated from the retroactive wage increases negotiated by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lerum</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, and under the circumstances obtaining in this case, the
said attorney's fees should belong to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lerum</span> to
the exclusion of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, <span class="GramE">We,</span>
therefore, find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the public respondents
in reaching this conclusion." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 502)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Considering that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> took no part in the negotiations leading to the
execution of the Memorandum of Agreement, a compromise agreement among the
creditors and former employees of Stanford to liquidate Stanford which we rule
as valid, we find no plausible reason for Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
to interfere with its implementation by filing complaints and/or pleadings with
the SEC, the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC in his effort to collect attorney's
fees not due him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the foregoing
findings, we find no need to discuss the other arguments posed by the
petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
