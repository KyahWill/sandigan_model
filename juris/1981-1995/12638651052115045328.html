Series of 1976 was passed by the Board disposing of the lot in favor of
petitioner by way of a negotiated sale in conformity with the decision in Civil
Case No. 950.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent
protested against the application of petitioner and on <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1978</st1:date>, the Board adopted Resolution No.
611, Series of 1978 denying private respondent's protest for the same
reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A request for reconsideration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of private </span>respondent was referred by

because the case had already <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">been </span>decided
by the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, a motion for reconsideration filed by private respondent
was favorably considered by the Board in Resolution No. 233, Series of 1981
dated <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Board directed the chief of LASEDECO
to investigate the occupancy and area of the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this investigation, it was found that only
private respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>the

between petitioner and private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1981</st1:date>,

decision dated <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1984</st1:date>,
both appeals were dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion
for reconsideration filed by petitioner was denied on <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent paid for the value of 1/2 of the lot and
applied for the issuance of a patent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
Resolution No. 185, Series of 1985 adopted on <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1985</st1:date>, the Board gave due course to the
application of private respondent and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for
the issuance of a patent to 1/2 portion of the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was also advised <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to file </span>his application and pay for </span>his

Petitioner's counsel was also served a copy of the resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1987</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

respondent court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Under the second and third assigned errors, petitioner contends
that the appellate court erred in giving due course to the petition that
assailed the two orders of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> which are
interlocutory in character and in holding that the trial court has no
jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 3270.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is precisely to correct the lower court when in the course of
proceedings it acts without jurisdiction or in excess thereof <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or if </span>the trial court judge otherwise
acted with grave abuse of discretion that the extraordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i>
or prohibition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>afforded to
parties as a relief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such writ is
available even in respect to interlocutory orders.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The appellate court correctly ruled that courts of justice will
not interfere with purely administrative matters rendered by administrative
bodies or officials acting within the scope of their power and authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The discretionary power vested in the proper
executive official, in the absence of arbitrariness or grave abuse so as to go
beyond the statutory authority, is not subject to the contrary judgment or
control of the courts and is treated with finality.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">When Board Resolution No. 272 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was </span>passed in 1981, petitioner appealed to the Office of the
President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After his appeal was denied
on <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1984</st1:date>, he did
not file a petition for review in this court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the said decision became final and it was duly implemented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree that when petitioner filed Civil
Case No. 3270, the trial court should have refrained from interfering with said
administrative disposition of the chief executive absent any showing of lack or
excess of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner had no capacity to file the questioned suit
in the lower court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The real
party-in-interest who can seek the nullification of the land grant is the
government or the state.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the fourth and last, assigned error, petitioner argues that
it was erroneous for the appellate court to hold that the case should be
dismissed by the lower court for failure to comply with a provision of
Presidential Decree No. 1508 before filing the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleges that this rule is not applicable
in said case for one of the parties therein is the government <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>any subdivision or instrumentality
thereof which is excepted from this requirement under Section 2 of said law.</p>

<p class="BODY">True it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>that the
Board is a government instrumentality but the petitioner and private respondent
who are also contending parties in the case are residents of the same <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section
</span>6 of Presidential Decree No. 1508 should apply to them as it provides -</p>
