scampered away in panic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two more shots
followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Within minutes, a man was dead
with two bullet wounds in his back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
name was Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assailant, according to the prosecution, was Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
charged with murder in an information dated <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1983</st1:date>, and underwent trial after he waived

is now on appeal before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented two witnesses who claimed they saw the
actual shooting of the victim by <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tomas <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span> testified that in the
evening in question he had gone to the public dance with his cousin Nathaniel,
who at the time of the incident was standing to his right while they were
watching the people dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
hearing a shot, he saw Nathaniel slumped on the ground with his face down and <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> standing over him with a drawn gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> fired two
more shots at Nathaniel and then fled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The witness added that he then went to the fallen Nathaniel, who said to
him, "Tommy, it was <span class="SpellE">Ette</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">Ette</span>,"
referring to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nathaniel died
soon thereafter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other eyewitness was Edgar <span class="SpellE">Pulga</span>,
who corroborated Tomas <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span> and said he was also
at the public dance that evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
about two meters from Nathaniel when the shooting occurred and he also
identified the killer as <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Testifying for himself, the accused-appellant pleaded the defense
of alibi, claiming he was nowhere at the scene of the crime at the time of its
commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, he stated
under oath, he was at his residence in <span class="SpellE">Jaro</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, supervising the unloading of
construction materials he had earlier brought from <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He declared that the unloading was done from <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11 o'clock</st1:time>
of that night.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For corroboration, the defense presented Pat. <span class="SpellE">Bendolo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Artoza</span>, who said he went to <span class="SpellE">Marmita's</span>
residence at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10 o'clock</st1:time> that night to
buy gasoline and saw <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> there;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Pat. Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Katangkatang</span>, who said he saw <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> unloading the construction materials at his
residence that night;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and Sgt. Jose <span class="SpellE">Catan</span>, who testified to the same
effect.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another policeman, Lt. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Morados</span>,
declared that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span> had informed him that
Nathaniel's killer was "a man of <span class="SpellE">Ite</span>,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
while Capt. <span class="SpellE">Mameliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiberio</span>
said that Tomas had pointed to <span class="SpellE">Ansoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
For his part, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>,
who was present when the crime was committed, swore that when he talked to the
victim the latter had lost his power of speech and could not answer when asked
who had shot him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is curious that all these witnesses of the accused-appellant
belonged to the police force, which is probably one reason why the trial court
did not place much reliance on their testimonies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To understand this statement, one must first
examine the apparent motive for the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence discloses that there was bad blood between the
victim and <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> because of their business
competition in the operation of the game of "<span class="SpellE">masiao</span>"
in <span class="SpellE">Jaro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nathaniel belonged to an organization opposed to the one reputedly
headed by <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, Nathaniel was at the time of his death facing a charge for the
killing of Cesar <span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, allegedly one of <span class="SpellE">Marmita's</span> men.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
His co-accused, Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Aruta</span>, testified on the
extent of the rival "<span class="SpellE">masiao</span>" operations,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
as so too did Sofia <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>, Nathaniel's mother, who
stressed the enmity between her son and <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>
because of their business differences.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> himself was under investigation for alleged illegal
possession of firearms after a search of his premises presumably instigated by
Nathaniel's group.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
And it is also worth mentioning that shortly after Nathaniel's killing, on that
very same night, Tomas Quinones himself, claiming self-defense, stabbed Oscar <span class="SpellE">Lauron</span>, an employee of <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Against this background, the motive for the killing of Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span> becomes readily apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the "<span class="SpellE">masiao</span>"
operations is not hearsay, as contended by the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were described of their own personal
knowledge by <span class="SpellE">Aruta</span> and the victim's mother, not to mention
Tomas <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This witness also declared that his cousin Nathaniel was a coordinator
of another organization in competition with <span class="SpellE">Marmita's</span>
gambling business.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Asked why Nathaniel and his family were hostile to him; <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> said they probably envied him his station in life
and financial success and resented his not mixing with them because of their
activities.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
This is hardly credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere envy of
one who, significantly, has not mixed with them at all is in the view of the
Court not a plausible explanation for their accusing him of such a serious
crime as murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi is far from convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As suggested by the Solicitor General,
"it would not be surprising if a policeman would testify in (<span class="SpellE">Marmita's</span>) favor," considering that he "is a
local gambling lord,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
with all its implications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
there is no satisfactory explanation for the unloading of the construction
materials from <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1983" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1983</st1:date>, when they were landed
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1983</st1:date>, and could have been claimed on an
earlier date and unloaded more conveniently in the daytime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the distance from <span class="SpellE">Jaro</span> to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> San Vicente is
about three kilometers only<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
and could have been negotiated within minutes to enable <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>
to commit the crime and return to <span class="SpellE">Jaro</span> without much
difficulty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense points to certain flaws in the evidence of the
prosecution, but it is our view that they do not impair its essential
credibility or justify the conclusion that the accused-appellant was
erroneously convicted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span> was
not a reliable witness because he said Nathaniel was shot in the breast and
stomach when the medical report showed that he was shot in the back; that
Nathaniel could not have identified <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> as the
killer because the victim was already dead or unable to speak at that time, as
testified by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Mesina</span>; and that Tomas did not
immediately point to <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> as the killer and in
fact named "a man of <span class="SpellE">Ite</span>" and later <span class="SpellE">Ansoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> as the person who
shot Nathaniel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also questions the belated presentation of Edgar <span class="SpellE">Pulga</span>, who was not even listed as a prosecution witness and
by his own admission informed his mother-in-law that <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>
was the killer only after four days following the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Nathaniel's dying statement that he was shot by <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>, the defense wonders how the victim could have
known his killer inasmuch as the shots came from behind and the victim fell
forward and could not look back at his assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tomas <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span> said the victim was shot
in the breast and stomach not in his testimony at the trial but in the
statement he gave the police on <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="7">July 8,
 1982</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
He did not specifically affirm it at the trial, where he said he was not sure
if the last two shots had hit the victim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
At any rate, it is remembered that he approached the victim after the shooting
and must have gotten the impression that the wounds were in the places
indicated because of the blood in Nathaniel's front from the point of exit of
the first bullet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was explained by
Dr. Angel Cordero, who conducted the autopsy, thus:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, Doctor, you are sure now that this
first wound Exhibit "B-1" the point of entrance of the bullet was at
the back, the lower chest as you mentioned, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
it pass thru the body?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bullet came
out on the posterior part of the man?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The slug went outside the body not on the
posterior or back part of the body but at its front anterior part of the body.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
from the back the bullet came out in the front?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
your honor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As for the victim's alleged inability to reveal his killer
because of his condition shortly before his death, the same witness declared as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Considering these two wounds doctor would you say that the victim would
not be able to speak anymore?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Well, this particular wound specially this fired wound is considered as
mortal wound because it involved the mortal organ of the body, but it does not
mean that he is going to die there and there or will produce instantaneous
death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Would
he be deprived of speech?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
your honor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We may agree with the theory that Nathaniel could not have seen
his killer as he was shot in the back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But even without his statement, there is sufficient evidence pointing to
<span class="SpellE">Marmita</span> as the person who shot him from behind and
continued to shoot him as he lay prostrate on the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the Solicitor General, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>'
delay in identifying the killer must have been due to his fear of reprisal from
the accused, whom he knew to be a powerful and influential person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We accept this explanation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the trial judge
abused his discretion in rejecting the testimony of the defense witnesses that
Tomas had identified other persons as the killer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was for him to assess the credibility of
the witnesses after observing their conduct on the stand and examining their
motives.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pulga's</span> failure to immediately come
forward to denounce his brother-in-law's killer is understandable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that he had eloped with the
victim's sister and later married her in a civil ceremony without her mother's
blessings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, even during the wake for Nathaniel, he and his mother-in-law were
still not on speaking terms and it was to his other brother-in-law, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>, that he reported having seen Nathaniel's
shooting.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
He was later asked to testify because Ruben <span class="SpellE">Tualla</span>,
Nathaniel's companion on the night of the crime, was reportedly
"bought" by the accused-appellant to stay away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his testimony, <span class="SpellE">Pulga</span>
explained that he did not immediately succor his brother-in-law because he did
not know then that the victim was Nathaniel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We note with disapproval the observations of the trial court
regarding the unreliability of the results of the paraffin test conducted on
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Marmita</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact is that the test was conducted not on the accused-appellant but
on Adriano Marmite, who is not involved in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The paraffin test is entirely irrelevant except
as an indication of the carelessness of the judge in the consideration of the
evidence before him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although his error
has not detracted from the correctness of his conclusion finding the
accused-appellant guilty, Judge <span class="SpellE">Dacuycuy</span> is
admonished against similar negligence in the future.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the killing of Nathaniel <span class="SpellE">Quiñones</span>
was attended with treachery as he was shot in the back and even when he was
already helpless on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
crime committed was murder and, there being no modifying circumstance, the
accused-appellant was correctly subjected to the penalties imposed in the
decision of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is strong evidence in this case of the prevalence of "<span class="SpellE">masiao</span>" in the province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
and the involvement of many persons in this vicious type of gambling that is
draining the resources, and even the lives, of many persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Weakening the moral fiber of the people,
including possibly those charged with the enforcement of the laws, it is also
staining the name of the entire province, and blighting its future, with its dark
record of corruption and lawlessness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is hoped that the authorities will take the needed resolute action against this
serious but not insoluble problem and liberate the persons caught in its web
from its virulent addiction.</p>
