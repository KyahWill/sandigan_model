<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On September 10, 1971,
the plaintiff as LESSOR, and defendants as LESSEES, entered into a written
contract entitled "Equipment Lease Agreement" (Record on Appeal, pp.
9-32) involving eight (8) units single sideband (HP) radio-telephone type
communicator-300 2 channels, the term of which lease is for an irrevocable
period of 36 months commencing in September, 1971 at a monthly rental of
P1,900.80 with 1% per month inte­rest on delinquent rentals (Ibid., pp. 35-36).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">December
 27, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, plaintiff
filed a complaint in the trial court alleging that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"the defendants violated the terms of
the contract by defaulting in the payment of the agreed rentals and as of
November 15, 1972, the arrearage in rents amount to P19,583.16 and despite
demands failed to settle the same; that on August 15, 1972, plaintiff received
from defend­ant, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> Distributors Corporation a
formal letter dated August 14, 1972 advising the plain­tiff, among other
things, about said defendant's position to effect a surrender of the units as
its top management has decided to change its posture on its business strategy
and offered to surrender the equipment and to cease in payment of the rentals
upon its surrender; that in another letter dated September 13, 1973, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> Distributors Cor­poration reiterated its desire
to return the leased equipment, in view of which the plaintiff sent its
representative to inspect the leased equipment, to see if damages can be
minimized by both parties but plaintiff found out that the physical condition
of the leased equipment is such that it has deteriorated to such an extent
beyond ordinary wear and tear of a good user that extensive repairs are neces­sary
to put the equipment to serviceable unit; and that there is no one interested
to lease the said equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
further alleged that the equipment leased to <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
Distributors Corporation were purchased by plaintiff specifi­cally to meet the
needs and existing requirements of said defendant and had it not been for such
client, the plaintiff had no reason to acquire the said equipment and that the
defendant <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> Securities Corporation acted as
surety to secure faithful compliance of all the terms and conditions of the
Equipment Lease Agreement and is jointly severally liable with the other
defendant to the plaintiff." (CA Resolution, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 25.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, the defendants countered that the lease
agreement concerning eight (8) units of single sideband (HP) radio-telephone
type communicator, had been extinguished by a subsequent law prohibiting the
use of privately owned radio facilities and all other kinds of media of
communication thereby rendering the performance of defendants' obli­gation
(payment of rental) impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
of this change of condi­tions that supervened during the term of the lease
contract, defendants as lessees of the eight units of radio-telephone
communicators were deprived of their use and are by law excused from payment of
said rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They claim that such change
of conditions in effect extinguished the object of the lease so that they
cannot be held liable for payment of subsequent rentals after September 22,
1972 when the prohibiting law took effect and the alleged irrevocable term of
the lease agreement for three years was rendered nugatory because the very
object of the contract was subse­quently prohibited by law and there can be no
valid contract without a lawful object (Record on Appeal, pp. 43-44).</p>

<p class="BODY">At the pre-trial, the parties agreed to file their respective
memo­randa on the issue of whether or not the Lease Contract object of the case
was deemed terminated with the issuance by the then President of the
Philippines of Letter of Instructions No. 1 whereby the Secretary of National
Defense was ordered to take over the control or cause the taking over and
control of newspapers, magazines, radio and radio facilities and other media of
communication (Ibid., pp. 49-50).</p>

in Chief of all the Armed Forces of the Philip­pines and in order to prevent
the use of privately owned newspapers, magazines, radio and television

(Phil.) v. Reyes, 84 Phil 654 the act of the ruling power (the martial law
administration the instant case) was not an act of mere trespass but a trespass
in law (not a "<span class="SpellE">perturbacion</span> de <span class="SpellE">mero</span> <span class="SpellE">hecho</span>" but a "<span class="SpellE">perturbacion</span> de <span class="SpellE">derecho</span>"),

duty to pay rentals from the date the contract terminated by operation of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that in a letter to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>

already were asking for the end of the lease contract is of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost everybody knew by that time that
martial law would be eventually imposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

object became illegal on <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="9">September 22,
