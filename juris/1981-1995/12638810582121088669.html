<p class="BODY">Following is the chronology of the undisputed material facts
culled from the Appellate Tribunal's judgment of <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1990</st1:date>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

filed a verified complaint for recovery of a sum of money and damages against
Queensland Hotel, etc. and <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Adarna</span> (docketed as Civil Case No. No. 19513-89).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint contained an <i><span style="">ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">appplication</span>
for a writ of preliminary attachment.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> On <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1989</st1:date> Judge <span class="SpellE">Nartatez</span>,

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> On <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1989</st1:date> the attachment bond having been

issued.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> On <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1989</st1:date>, the summons and a copy of the
complaint, as well as the writ of attachment and a copy of the attachment bond,
were served on defendants <st1:state><st1:place>Queensland</st1:place></st1:state>
and <span class="SpellE">Adarna</span>; and pursuant to the writ, the sheriff
seized properties belonging to the latter.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> On September 6, 1989,
defendants Queensland and <span class="SpellE">Adarna</span> filed a motion to
discharge the attachment for lack of jurisdiction to issue the same because at
the time the order of attachment was promulgated (May 3, 1989) and the
attachment writ issued (May 11, 1989), the Trial Court had not yet acquired
jurisdiction over the cause and over the persons of the defendants.</p>

<p class="NUM">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> On <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1989</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>

<p class="NUM">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> On <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1989</st1:date>, the Trial Court issued an
Order denying the motion to discharge.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Order of <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1989</st1:date> was successfully challenged by <st1:state><st1:place>Queensland</st1:place></st1:state>
and <span class="SpellE">Adarna</span> in a special civil action of <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>instituted by them in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order was, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
annulled by the Court of Appeals in its Decision of <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Appellate Court's decision closed with <span style="">the following disposition:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“ * * the Orders dated May 3, 1989 granting the issuance of <span style="">a writ </span>of preliminary attachment, dated
September 19, 1989 denying the motion to discharge attachment; dated November
7, 1989 denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration; as well as all other
orders emanating <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, specially the Writ of
Attachment dated <span style="">May 11, </span>1989 and
Notice of Levy on Preliminary Attachment dated May 11, 1989, are hereby
declared null and void and the attachment hereby ordered <span style="">DISCHARGED.”</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Tribunal declared that -</p>

<blockquote>" * * While it is true that a prayer for the issuance of a
writ of preliminary attachment may be included in the complaint, as is usually
done, it is likewise true that the Court does not acquire jurisdiction over the
person of the defendant until he is duly summoned or voluntarily appears, and
adding the phrase that it be issued <i>'ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>'</i>
does not confer said jurisdiction before actual summons had been made, nor
retroact jurisdiction upon summons being made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>* * ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It went on to say, citing <span class="SpellE"><i>Sievert</i></span><i> v.</i> <i>Court of Appeals,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that "in a proceeding in attachment," the “critical time which must
be identified is * * when the trial court acquires authority under law to act
coercively against the defendant or his property * *; " and that
"that critical time is the time of the vesting of jurisdiction in the
court over the person of the defendant in the main case."</p>

<p class="BODY">Reversal of this Decision of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1990</st1:date> is what <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Light seeks in the present appellate proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question is whether or not a writ of preliminary attachment
may issue <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></i> against a defendant before
acquisition of jurisdiction of the latter's person by service of summons or his
voluntary submission to the Court's authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court rules that the question must be answered in the
affirmative and that consequently, the petition for review will have to be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is incorrect to theorize that after an action or proceeding
has been commenced and jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff has been
vested in the court, <i>but before acquisition of jurisdiction over the person
of the defendant (either by service of summons or his voluntary submission to
the court's authority)</i>, nothing can be validly done by the plaintiff or the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is wrong to assume that the
validity of acts done during this period should be dependent on, or held in
suspension until, the actual <span class="SpellE">obtention</span> of
jurisdiction over the defendant's person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">obtention</span> by the court of jurisdiction
over the person of the defendant is one thing; quite another is the acquisition
of jurisdiction over the person of the plaintiff or over the subject-matter or
nature of the action, or the <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span> or object
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">An action or proceeding is commenced by the filing of the
complaint or other initiatory pleading.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
By that act, the jurisdiction <span style="">of the
court over the subject matter or nature of the action or proceeding is invoked
or called into activity;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and it is thus that the court acquires
jurisdiction over said subject matter or nature of the action</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">And it is by that self-same act of the
plaintiff (or petitioner) of filing the complaint (or other appropriate
pleading) -­- by which he signifies his submission to the court's power and</span>
authority -- that jurisdiction is acquired by the court over his person.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is obtained,
as above stated, by the service of summons or other coercive process upon him
or by his voluntary submission to the authority of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The events that follow the filing of the complaint as a matter of
routine are well known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
complaint is filed, summons issues to the defendant, the summons is then
transmitted to the sheriff, and finally, service of the summons is effected on
the defendant in any of the ways authorized by the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is thus ordinarily some appreciable
interval of time between the day of the filing of the complaint and the day of
service of summons on the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During this period, different acts may be done by the plaintiff or by
the Court which are of unquestionable validity and propriety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among these, for example, are the appointment
of a guardian <i>ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span>,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the grant of authority to the plaintiff to prosecute the suit as a pauper
litigant,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the amendment of the complaint by the plaintiff as a matter of right without
leave of court,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
authorization by the Court of service of summons by publication,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
the dismissal of the action by the plaintiff on mere notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This, too, is true with regard to the provisional remedies of
preliminary attachment, preliminary injunction, receivership or <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
They may be validly and properly applied for and granted even before the
defendant is summoned or is heard from.</p>

<p class="BODY">A preliminary attachment may be defined, paraphrasing the Rules
of Court, as the provisional remedy in virtue of which a plaintiff or other
proper party may, at the commencement of the action or at any time thereafter,
have the property of the adverse party taken into the custody of the court as
security for the satisfaction of any judgment that may be recovered.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a remedy which is purely statutory in respect of which the law requires a
strict construction of the provisions granting it.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Withal no principle, statutory or jurisprudential, prohibits its issuance by
any court before acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 57 in fact speaks of the grant of the remedy "at the
commencement of the action or at any time thereafter."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The phrase, "at the commencement of the action," obviously refers to
the date of the filing of the complaint -- which, as above pointed out, is the
date that marks "the commencement of the action;"<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and the reference plainly is to a time before summons is served on the
defendant, or even before summons issues.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the rule is saying quite clearly is that after an action is
properly commenced -- by the filing of the complaint and the payment of all
requisite docket and other fees -- the plaintiff may apply for and obtain a
writ of preliminary attachment upon fulfillment of the pertinent requisites
laid down by law, and that he may do so at any time, either before or after
service of summons on the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this indeed, has been the immemorial practice sanctioned by the courts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for the plaintiff or other proper party to
incorporate the application for attachment in the complaint or other
appropriate pleading (counterclaim, cross-claim, third-party claim) and for the
Trial Court to issue the writ <i><span style="">ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>at
the commencement of the action if it finds the application otherwise sufficient
in form and substance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Toledo v. Burgos,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled that a hearing on a motion or application for preliminary
attachment is not generally necessary unless otherwise directed by the Trial
Court in its discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
And in <span class="SpellE"><i>Filinvest</i></span><i> Credit Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court declared that "(n)<span class="SpellE">othing</span> in the Rules
of Court makes notice and hearing indispensable and mandatory requisites for
the issuance of a writ of attachment." The only pre-requisite is that the
Court be satisfied, upon consideration of "the affidavit of the applicant
or of some other person who personally knows the facts, that a sufficient cause
of action exists, that the case is one of those mentioned in Section 1 ** (Rule
57), that there is no other sufficient security for the claim sought to be
enforced by the action, and that the amount due to the applicant, or the value
of the property the possession of which he is<span style=""> </span>entitled to recover, is as much as the sum for which the order
(of attachment) is granted above all legal counterclaims."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
If the court be so satisfied, the "order of attachment shall be
granted,"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and the writ shall issue upon the applicant's posting of "a bond executed
to the adverse party in an amount to be fixed by the judge, not exceeding the
plaintiff's claim, conditioned that the latter will pay all the costs which may
be adjudged to the adverse party and all damages which he may sustain by reason
of the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was
not entitled thereto."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Mindanao Savings &amp; Loan Association, Inc. v. Court of
Appeals</i>, decided on April 18, 1989,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court had occasion to emphasize the postulate that no hearing is required
on an application for preliminary attachment, with notice to the defendant, for
the reason that this "would defeat the objective of the remedy ** (since
the) time which such a hearing would take, could be enough to enable the
defendant to abscond or dispose of his property before a writ of attachment
issues." As observed by a former member of this Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
such a procedure would warn absconding debtors-defendants of the commencement
of the suit against them and the probable seizure of their properties, and thus
give them the advantage of time to hide their assets, leaving the
creditor-plaintiff holding the proverbial empty bag; it would place the
creditor-applicant in danger of losing any security for a favorable judgment
and thus give him only an illusory victory.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Withal, ample modes of
recourse against a preliminary attachment are secured by law to the
defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relative ease with which
a preliminary attachment may be obtained is matched and paralleled by the
relative facility with which the attachment may legitimately be prevented or
frustrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These modes of recourse
against preliminary attachments granted by Rule 57 were discussed at some
length by the separate opinion in </span><st1:place><i><span style="">Mindanao</span></i></st1:place><i><span style=""> Savings &amp; Loans <span class="SpellE">Asso</span>. Inc. v. C.A.,
supra</span></i><span style="">.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That separate opinion
stressed that there are two (2) ways of discharging an attachment:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>first</i>, by the posting of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>; and <i>second</i>, by a showing of its
improper or irregular issuance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">1.0.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The submission of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
is an efficacious mode of lifting an attachment already enforced against
property, or even of <i>preventing its enforcement altogether</i>.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">1.1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When property has already been seized under attachment,
the attachment may be discharged upon <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> in
accordance with Section 12 of Rule 57.</p>

<blockquote>‘SEC. 12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i><span style="">Discharge of attachment upon giving <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>. </span></i><span style="">-- At<i> </i></span>any time after an order of attachment has been
granted, the party whose property has been attached or the person appearing in
his behalf, may, upon reasonable notice to the applicant, apply to the judge
who granted the order, or to the judge of the court in which the action is
pending, for an order discharging the attachment wholly or in part on the
security given * * in an amount equal to the value of the property attached as
determined by the judge to secure the payment of any judgment that the
attaching creditor may recover in the action.* *’</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">1.2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even before actual levy on property,
seizure under attachment may be prevented also upon <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant need not wait until his
property is seized before seeking the discharge of the attachment by a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
made possible by Section 5 of Rule 57.</p>

<blockquote>'SEC. 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i><span style="">Manner of attaching property. </span></i><span style="">-- The<i> </i></span>officer executing the
order shall without delay attach, to await judgment and execution in the
action, all the properties of the party against whom the order is issued in the
province, not exempt from execution, or so much thereof as may be sufficient to
satisfy the applicant's demand, <i><u>unless the former makes a deposit </u></i><i><u><span style="">with </span>the clerk or judge of the court
from which the order</u></i><u> <i>issued, </i></u><i><u><span style="">or </span>gives a counter-bond executed to the
applicant, in an amount sufficient to satisfy such demand besides costs, or in
an amount</u></i><u> <i>equal</i> <i>to the value of the property which is
about to be attached, to secure payment to<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>applicant of any judgment
which he may recover in</i> <i>the</i> <i>action</i></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">** .’ </span>(Emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">2.0.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>, a preliminary attachment may also be lifted or
discharged on the ground that it has been irregularly or improperly issued, in
accordance with Section 13 of Rule 57.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Like the first, this second mode of lifting an attachment may be
resorted to even <i>before</i> any property has been levied on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it may be availed of <i>after
property has been </i><i><u><span style="">released</span></u>
from a levy on attachment</i>, as is made clear by said Section 13, <i>viz.</i>:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>'SEC. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Discharge of
attachment for improper or irregular issuance.</i> -- The party whose property
has been attached may also, at any time either <i><u>BEFORE or AFTER the
release of the attached property, or before any attachment shall have been
actually levied</u>,</i> upon reasonable notice to the attaching creditor,
apply to the judge who granted the order, or to the judge of the court in which
the action is pending, for an order to discharge the attachment on the ground
that the same was improperly or irregularly issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the motion be made on affidavits on the
part of the party whose property has been attached, but not otherwise, the
attaching creditor may oppose the same by counter-affidavits or other evidence
in addition to that on which the attachment was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>** .' (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is so because, "(a)s pointed out in <i>Calderon v.
I.A.C.</i>, 155 SCRA 531 (1987), 'The attachment debtor cannot be deemed to
have waived any defect in the issuance of the attachment writ by simply
availing himself of one way of discharging the attachment writ, <span class="SpellE">instread</span> of the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> is a
speedier way of discharging the attachment writ maliciously sought out by the
attaching creditor instead of the other way, which, in most instances * * would

<blockquote>(a) <i>When an attachment may not be
dissolved by a showing of its irregular or improper issuance:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>" **<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(W)hen the
preliminary attachment is issued upon a ground which is at the same time the
applicant's cause of action; e.g., ‘an action for money or property embezzled
or fraudulently misapplied or converted to his own use by a public officer, or
an officer of a corporation, or an attorney, factor, broker, agent, or clerk,
in the course of his employment as such, or by any other person in a fiduciary
capacity, or for a willful violation of duty,’ (Sec. 1 [b], Rule 57), or 'an
action against a party who has been guilty of fraud in contracting the debt or
incurring the obligation upon which the action is brought’ (Sec. 1 [d], Rule
57), the defendant is not allowed to file a motion to dissolve the <span class="SpellE">attrachment</span> under Section 13 of Rule 57 by offering to show
the falsity of the factual averments in the plaintiff's application and <span style="">affidavits on which the writ was based -- and
consequently that the writ based thereon had been improperly or irregularly
issued (SEE Benitez v. I.A.C., 154 SCRA 41) -- the reason being that the
hearing on such a motion for dissolution of the writ would be tantamount to a
trial of the merits of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the merits of the action would be ventilated </span>at <span style="">a mere hearing of a motion, instead of at the
regular trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, when the writ
of attachment is of this nature, the only way it can be dissolved is by a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> (G.B. Inc. v. Sanchez, 98 Phil. 886)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<i> Effect of the dissolution of a
preliminary attachment on the plaintiff's attachment bond:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>" <span style="">* * .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dissolution of the preliminary attachment
upon security given, or a showing of its irregular or improper issuance, does
not of course operate to discharge the sureties on plaintiff's own attachment
bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That bond is 'executed to the adverse party,
** conditioned that the ** (applicant) will pay all the costs which may be
adjudged to the adverse party and all damages which he may sustain by reason of
the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant was not
entitled thereto' (SEC. 4, Rule 57).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, until that determination is made, as to the applicant's
entitlement to the attachment, his bond must stand and cannot be
withdrawn."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the other provisional remedies, i.e., preliminary
injunction (Rule 58), receivership (Rule 59), <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
or delivery of personal property (Rule 60), the rule is the same:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they may also issue <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It goes without saying that whatever be the acts done by the
Court prior to the acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of the
defendant, as above indicated -- issuance of summons, order of attachment and
writ of attachment (and/or appointment of guardian <i>ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span></i>,
or grant of authority to the plaintiff to prosecute the suit as a pauper
litigant, or amendment of the complaint by the plaintiff as it matter of right
without leave of court<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
-- and however valid and proper they might otherwise be, these do not and
cannot bind and affect the defendant until and unless jurisdiction over his
person is eventually obtained by the court, either by service on him of summons
or other coercive process or his voluntary submission to the court's
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, when the sheriff or
other proper officer commences implementation of the writ of attachment, it is essential
that he serve on the defendant not only a copy of the applicant's affidavit and
attachment bond, and of the order of attachment, as explicitly required by
Section 5 of Rule 57, but also the summons addressed to said defendant as well
as a copy of the complaint and order for appointment of guardian <i>ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span></i>, if any, as also explicitly directed by Section
3, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Service of all such documents is indispensable not only for the
acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant, but also upon
considerations of fairness, to apprise the defendant of the complaint against
him, of the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment and the grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and thus accord him the opportunity to prevent
attachment of his property by the posting of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
in an amount equal to the plaintiffs claim in the complaint pursuant to Section
5 (or Section 12), Rule 57, or dissolving it by causing dismissal of the
complaint itself on any of the grounds set forth in Rule 16, or demonstrating
the insufficiency of the applicant's affidavit or bond <span style="">in </span>accordance with Section 13, Rule 57.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was on account of the failure to comply with this fundamental
requirement of service of summons and the other documents above indicated that writs
of attachment issued by the Trial Court <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></i>
were struck down by this Court's Third Division in two (2) cases, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><i>Sievert</i></span><i>
v. Court of Appeals,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
and <i>BAC Manufacturing and Sales Corporation v. Court of Appeals, et al.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
In contrast to the case at bar -- where the summons and a copy of the
complaint, as well as the order and writ of attachment and the attachment bond
were served on the defendant -- in <span class="SpellE"><i>Sievert</i></span>,
levy on attachment was attempted notwithstanding that only the petition for
issuance of the writ of preliminary attachment was served on the defendant,
without any prior or accompanying summons and copy of the complaint; and in <i>BAC
Manufacturing and Sales Corporation</i>, neither the summons nor the order
granting the preliminary attachment or the writ of attachment itself was served
on the defendant "before or at the time the levy was made."</p>

<p class="BODY">For the guidance of all concerned, the Court reiterates and
reaffirms the proposition that writs of attachment may properly issue ex <span class="SpellE"><i>parte</i></span> provided that the Court is satisfied that the
relevant requisites <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> have been fulfilled by
the applicant, although it may, in its discretion, require prior hearing on the
application with notice to the defendant; but that levy on property pursuant to
the writ thus issued may not be validly effected unless preceded, or
contemporaneously accompanied, by service on the defendant of summons, a copy
of the complaint (and of the appointment of guardian <i>ad <span class="SpellE">litem</span></i>,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>if any), the application for attachment
(if not incorporated in but submitted separately from the complaint), the order
of attachment, and the plaintiffs attachment bond.</p>
