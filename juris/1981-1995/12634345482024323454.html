				<h4>
				G.R. No. 82606, December 18, 1992</h4>
				<H3>PRIMA PARTOSA-JO, PETITIONER, VS. THE
HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND HO HANG (WITH ALIASES JOSE JO AND CONSING), RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The herein private respondent, Jose Jo, admits to having
cohabited with three women and fathered fifteen children.  The first of these women, the herein
petitioner, claims to be his legal wife by whom he begot a daughter, Monina
Jo.  The other two women and their
respective offspring are not parties to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1980, the petitioner filed a complaint against Jo for judicial
separation of conjugal property, docketed as Civil Case No. 51, in addition to
an earlier action for support, also against him and docketed as Civil Case No.
36, in the Regional Trial Court of Negros Oriental, Branch 35.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two cases were consolidated and tried jointly.  On November 29, 1983, Judge German G. Lee,
Jr. rendered an extensive decision, the dispositive portion of which read:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing arguments and
considerations, this court hereby holds that the plaintiff Prima Partosa was
legally married to Jose Jo alias Ho Hang, alias Consing, and, therefore, is
entitled to support as the lawfully wedded wife and the defendant is hereby
ordered to give a monthly support of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">P500.00
to the plaintiff Prima Partosa, to be paid on or before the 5th day of every
month, and to give to the plaintiff the amount of P</span>40,000.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">for the construction of the house in Zamboanguita,
Negros Oriental where she may live separately from the defendant being entitled
under the law to separate maintenance being the innocent spouse and to pay the
amount of P19,200.00 to the plaintiff by way of support in-arrears and to pay
the plaintiff the amount of P3,000.00 in the concept of attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As will be noticed, there was a definite disposition of the
complaint for support but none of the complaint for judicial separation of
conjugal property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jo elevated the decision to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed
the ruling of the trial court in the complaint for support.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> The
complaint for judicial separation of conjugal property was dismissed for lack
of a cause of action and on the ground that separation by agreement was not
covered by Article 178 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">When their motions for reconsideration were denied, both parties
came to this Court for relief.  The
private respondent's petition for review o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">n
<i><u>certiorari</u></i> </span>was dismissed for tardiness in our resolution
dated February 17, 1988, where we also affirmed the legality of the marriage
between Jose and Prima and the obligation of the former to support her and her
daughter.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition deals only with the complaint for judicial
separation of conjugal property.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is here submitted that the Court of Appeals erred in holding
that:  a) the judicial separation of
conjugal property sought was not allowed under Articles 175, 178 and 191 of the
Civil Code; and b) no such separation was decreed by the trial court in the
dispositive portion of its decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent contends that the decision of the trial
court can no longer be reviewed at this time because it has long since become
final and executory.  As the decretal
portion clearly made no disposition of Civil Case No. 51, that case should be
considered impliedly dismissed.  The
petitioner should have called the attention of the trial court to the omission
so that the proper rectification could be made on time.  Not having done so, she is now concluded by
the said decision, which can no longer be corrected at this late hour.</p>

<p class="BODY">We deal first with the second ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">While admitting that no mention was made of Civil Case No. 51 in
the dispositive portion of the decision of the trial court, the petitioner
argues that a disposition of that case was nonetheless made in the penultimate
paragraph of the decision reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>It is, therefore, hereby ordered that all properties in question
are considered properties of Jose Jo, the defendant in this case, subject to
separation of property under Article 178, third paragraph of the Civil Code,
which is subject of separate proceedings as enunciated herein.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner says she believed this to be disposition enough
and so did not feel it was necessary for her to appeal, particularly since the
order embodied in that paragraph was in her favor.  It was only when the respondent court observed that there was no
dispositive portion regarding that case and so ordered its dismissal that she
found it necessary to come to this Court for relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has a point.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dispositive portion of the decision in question was
incomplete insofar as it carried no ruling on the complaint for judicial
separation of conjugal property although it was extensively discussed in the
body of the decision.  The drafting of
the decision was indeed not exactly careful.  The petitioner's counsel, noting this, should have taken immediate steps
for the rectification of the omission so that the ruling expressed in the text
of the decision could have been embodied in the decretal portion.  Such alertness could have avoided this
litigation on a purely technical issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the technicality invoked in this case should not be
allowed to prevail over considerations of substantive justice.  After all, the technical defect is not
insuperable.  We have said time and
again that where there is an ambiguity caused by an omission or mistake in the
dispositive portion of the decision, this Court may clarify such ambiguity by
an amendment even after the judgment has become final.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> In
doing so, the Court may resort to the pleadings filed by the parties and the
findings of fact and the conclusions of law expressed in the text or body of
the decision.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court made definite findings on the complaint for
judicial separation of conjugal property, holding that the petitioner and the
private respondent were legally married and that the properties mentioned by
the petitioner were acquired by Jo during their marriage although they were
registered in the name of an apparent dummy.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question therefore that the penultimate paragraph of
the decision of the trial court was a ruling based upon such findings and so
should have been embodied in the dispositive portion.  The respondent court should have made the necessary modification
instead of dismissing Civil Case No. 51 and thus upholding mere form over
substance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the interest of substantive justice, and to expedite these
proceedings, we hereby make such modification.</p>

<p class="BODY">And now to the merits of Civil Case No. 51.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals dismissed the complaint on the ground that
the separation of the parties was due to their agreement and not because of
abandonment.  The respondent court
relied mainly on the testimony of the petitioner, who declared under oath that
she left Dumaguete City, where she and Jo were living together "because
that was our agreement." It held that an agreement to live separately
without just cause was void under Article 221 of the Civil Code and could not
sustain any claim of abandonment by the aggrieved spouse.  Its conclusion was that the only remedy
available to the petitioner was legal separation under Article 175 of the Civil
Code,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
by virtue of which the conjugal partnership of property would be terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the respondent court has
misinterpreted Articles 175, 178 and 191 of the Civil Code.  She submits that the agreement between her
and the private respondent was for her to temporarily live with her parents
during the initial period of her pregnancy and for him to visit and support
her.  They never agreed to separate
permanently.  And even if they did, this
arrangement was repudiated and ended in 1942, when she returned to him at
Dumaguete City and he refused to accept her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner invokes Article 178 (3) of the Civil Code, which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 178.  The separation in
fact between husband and wife without judicial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">approval, shall not affect the conjugal partnership, except tha</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">t</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the husband has
abandoned the wife without just cause for at least one year, she may petition
the court for a receivership, or administration by her of the conjugal
partnership property or separation of property.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted provision has been superseded by Article 128 of
the Family Code, which states:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 128.  If a spouse
without just cause abandons the other or fails to comply with his or her
obligations to the family, the aggrieved spouse may petition the court for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">receivership, for judicial separation of
property, or for authority to be the sole administrator of the conjugal
partnership property, subject to such precautionary conditions as the court may
impose.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The obligations to the family mentioned in the preceding paragraph
refer to marital, parental or property relations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A spouse is deemed to have abandoned the other when he or she has
left the conjugal dwelling without any intention of returning.  The spouse who has left the conjugal
dwelling for a period of three months or has failed within the same period to
give any information as to his or her whereabouts shall be <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
presumed to have no intention of returning to the conjugal dwelling.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under this provision, the aggrieved spouse may petition for
judicial separation on either of these grounds:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Abandonment by a
spouse of the other without just cause; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failure of one spouse
to comply with his or her obligations to the family without just cause, even if
said spouse does not leave the other spouse.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Abandonment implies a departure by one spouse with the avowed
intent never to return, followed by prolonged absence without just cause, and
without in the meantime providing in the least for one's family although able
to do so.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There must be absolute cessation of marital relations, duties and rights, with
the intention of perpetual separation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> This
idea is clearly expressed in the above-quoted provision, which states that
"a spouse is deemed to have abandoned the other when he or she has left
the conjugal dwelling without any intention of returning."</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that as early as 1942, the private respondent
had already rejected the petitioner, whom he denied admission to their conjugal
home in Dumaguete City when she returned from Zamboanguita.  The fact that she was not accepted by Jo demonstrates
all too clearly that he had no intention of resuming their conjugal
relationship.  Moreover, beginning 1968
until the final determination by this Court of the action for support in 1988,
the private respondent refused to give financial support to the
petitioner.  The physical separation of
the parties, coupled with the refusal by the private respondent to give support
to the petitioner, sufficed to constitute abandonment as a ground for the
judicial separation of their conjugal property.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the petitioner may also invoke the second ground
allowed by Article 128, for the fact is that he has failed without just cause
to comply with his obligations to the family as husband or parent.  Apart from refusing to admit his lawful wife
to their conjugal home in Dumaguete City, Jo has freely admitted to cohabiting
with other women and siring many children by them.  It was his refusal to provide for the petitioner and their
daughter that prompted her to file the actions against him for support and later
for separation of the conjugal property, in which actions, significantly, he
even denied being married to her.  The
private respondent has not established any just cause for his refusal to comply
with his obligations to his wife as a dutiful husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their separation thus falls also squarely under Article 135 of
the Family Code, providing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 135.  Any of the
following shall be considered sufficient cause for judicial separation of
property:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That at the time of
the petition, the spouses have been separated in fact for at least one year and
reconciliation is highly improbable.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The amendments introduced in the Family Code are applicable to
the case before us although they became effective only on August 3, 1988.  As we held in Ramirez vs. Court of Appeals:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>The greater weight of authority is inclined to the view that an
appellate court, in reviewing a judgment on appeal, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">will </span>dispose of a question according to the law prevailing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">at the time of such disposition, and not
according to the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">law </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">prevailing at the time of rendition of the
appealed judgment.  The court will
therefore reverse a judgment which was correct at the time it was originally
rendered where, by statute, there has been an intermediate change in the law
which renders such judgment erroneous at the time the case was finally disposed
of on appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order of judicial separation of the properties in question is
based on the finding of both the trial and respondent courts that the private
respondent is indeed their real owner.  It is these properties that should now be divided between him and the
petitioner, on the assumption that they were acquired during coverture and so
belong to the spouses half and half.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">As the private </span>respondent is a Chinese
citizen, the division must include such properties properly belonging to the
conjugal partnership as may have been registered in the name of other persons
in violation of the Anti-Dummy Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The past has caught up with the private respondent.  After his extramarital flings and a
succession of illegitimate children, he must now make an accounting to his
lawful wife of the properties he denied her despite his promise to her of his
eternal love and care.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED and the assailed
decision of the respondent court is MODIFIED.  Civil Case No. 51 is hereby decided in favor of the plaintiff, the
petitioner herein, and the conjugal property of the petitioner and the private
respondent is hereby ordered divided between them, share and share alike.  This division shall be implemented by the
trial court after determination of all the properties pertaining to the said
conjugal partnership, including those that may have been illegally registered
in the name of other persons.</p>
