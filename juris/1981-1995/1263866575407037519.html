				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MELENCIO-HERRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a verified complaint, filed on <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="11">9 November 1979</st1:date>, complainant <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bariñan</span> Tan seeks the disbarment of respondent Atty.
Galileo J. <span class="SpellE">Trocio</span> for immorality and conduct
unbecoming of a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant, owner and directress of <span class="SpellE">Harlyn</span>
Vocational School in <span class="SpellE">Baroy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
del Norte, declares that sometime in April, 1971, at about 8:30 PM, after
classes were dismissed, respondent, who is the legal counsel of the school,
overpowered her inside the office and, against her will, succeeded in having
carnal knowledge of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">a </span>result, she begot a son on <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="2"><span style="">5 </span>February
 1972</st1:date> whom she named and registered as Jewel Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She avers that respondent used to support
Jewel but subsequently lost <span class="GramE">interest</span> in doing so
thereby neglecting to defray <span style="">the needed expenses for </span>Jewel's well-being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Complainant also alleges </span>that the respondent
threatened her with the deportation of her <span style="">alien husband if she complained </span>to <span style="">the </span>authorities
since she was violating the Anti-Dummy <span style="">Law in operating </span>the vocational school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">threat, aside from the fact </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">hat Complainant </span>is
<span style="">a married
woman </span>with eight children and a school directress <span style="">at the time of the
sexual assault, made her desist </span>from <span style="">filing a charge against the respondent.</span>
However, after eight years and thorough <span style="">soul-searching, she decided to file this
administrative complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent,
in his Answer, admits </span>having acted as a lawyer of the vocational
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he contends that he had
<span style="">also </span>served
<span style="">as </span>the
<span style="">lawyer </span>of
the Complainant, <span style="">her family and her parents-in</span>-<span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
in 1971, he helped prosecute <span style="">a case for robbery committed against </span>Complainant's mother and
sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, in March of 1976, when a
fire of unknown origin gutted the school, he assisted the complainant in
collecting P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from FGU <span style="">Insurance </span>Group, and P40,000.00 from
Fortune Insurance Corporation as indemnities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With regard to the same case, <span style="">he also r</span>epresented complainant <span style="">in a </span>suit
involving a <span style="">P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> claim </span>against the Workmen's <span style="">Insurance </span>Corporation
before the then Court of First <span style="">Instance of </span><span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> <span style="">del </span>Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then in 1978, he <span style="">was </span>retained <span style="">as a collaborating attorney by Complainant's </span><span style="">family </span><span style="">in an </span>inheritance case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, her father-in-law had always
consulted him in matters affecting the <span class="SpellE">former’s</span>
store.</p>

<p class="BODY">But respondent vehemently denies that he had sexually assaulted
the Complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that her
motivation <span style="">in </span>filing this charge
was to get even with him after having been humiliated when he declined her
request to commit a "breach of trust." He states that in the
inheritance case he handled for her family. Complainant insisted that he report
to her mother and sisters that he had charged a fee of P15,000.00 instead of
the P2,500.00 he actually received so that she could pocket the
difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He refused and told the
Complainant to look for another lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She tried twice to make peace with him but was unsuccessful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rebuffed, she promised to get even with
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, this
complaint.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Another reason why Complainant filed the present case, respondent
claims, is to escape her indebtedness to him representing his services as legal
counsel of the school which were unpaid since 1974 and the accumulated
honoraria from her fire insurance claims.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These obligations were left unpaid despite demand made when respondent
learned that Complainant had sold a piece of land in <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="6">2 June 1980</st1:date>,
the Court, acting upon the Complaint and the Answer already filed, referred the
case to the Office of the Solicitor General for investigation, report and
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
</span><st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="8"><span style="">19 </span>August 1980</st1:date>, said Office, upon the request of the <span style="">Complaint that the investigation be held in <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte </span>as she and
her <span style="">witnesses </span>could not afford
to <span style="">come </span>to <st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, </span><span style="">referred </span>the case to the <span style="">Provincial </span>Fiscal of <span style="">said </span><span style="">province </span>for the necessary proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Between September and October of 1980, hearings <span style="">were conducted on </span>the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a Report and Recommendation, <span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="1"><span style="">16 </span>January 1981</st1:date>,
the Provincial Fiscal stated that <span style="">respondent
failed to attend the hearing despite the issuance of <span class="SpellE">subpoenae</span>;
that there <span style="">was </span></span><u>prima
facie</u> <span style="">evidence <span style="">showing </span>that respondent had committed
acts <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of his professional decorum; </span><span style="">and, that he was </span><span style="">recommending </span><span style="">disciplinary </span><span style="">action against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">case </span><span style="">were then forwarded to the Office of the
Solicitor General.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="9">1 September 1982</st1:date>,
the Office of the Solicitor General returned the records to the Provincial
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Lanao</span></span><span style=""> del </span>Norte for re-investigation on the
ground that the <span style="">investigation </span>was
conducted in the absence of respondent, who did not <span style="">appear </span>despite subpoenas sent to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span style="">further
proceedings were conducted </span>by the Provincial Fiscal <span style="">wherein </span>Respondent was allowed to
submit a sworn letter, <span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="12"><span style="">13 </span>December 1985</st1:date>,
amplifying on the defenses <span style="">contained in
his Answer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="2"><span style="">13
 February 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Provincial Fiscal </span>of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> <span style="">del </span>Norte issued a Resolution adopting
his previous Report <span style="">and </span>Recommendation
of <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="1">16 January 1981</st1:date>, which
found <u><span style="">prima
</span><span style="">facie</span></u><span style=""> </span>evidence to hold Respondent
administratively <span style="">liable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">On </span><span style="">the same day, the records of the case were referred back to the Office
of the Solicitor General.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="5"><span style="">16 </span>May
 <span style="">1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the Office of the <span style="">Solicitor </span>General
came up with its own Report recommending that Respondent be disbarred for gross
immoral conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="7">17 July 1986</st1:date>, as<span style=""> directed by the Court, the Solicitor General filed </span>a <span style="">formal Complaint for disbarment against
Respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1990" day="29" month="5"><span style="">29 May
 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span>the
case <span style="">was raffled to this Second
Division and was included in the latter's agenda </span>on <st1:date year="1990" day="13" month="6"><span style="">13 June 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent has filed an Answer, Complainant her Reply, while
Respondent's Rejoinder, as required by the Court, was<span style=""> received on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="3" month="10"><span style="">3 October 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
required pleadings being</span> <span style="">complete,
this case is now ripe for resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue for determination is whether or not Respondent should
be disbarred for immoral conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
in turn, hinges on the question of whether he had, in fact, sexually assaulted
the Complainant as a consequence of which the latter begot a child by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find insufficient basis to sustain Complainant's charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The outrage allegedly took place during the last week of April,
1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, no criminal charge was filed,
and it was only about eight years later, on <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="11">5 November 1979</st1:date>, that an administrative complaint was
presented before this <span style="">Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's explanation that Respondent's </span><span style="">threat </span>to cause the deportation of <span style="">her alien </span>husband should she report to
anyone made her desist from filing a charged is not credible as she had
admitted having lost contact with her husband when he learned of respondent's
transgression that very <span style="">same </span>evening
(p. 3, TSN,<span style=""> 16 October 1980, p. 46, </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">fear </span>that she speaks of,<span style=""> therefore, had become </span>inexistent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another factor <span style="">that
engenders doubt in the mind of the Court is </span>the fact that after the
alleged incident, <span style="">she </span>continued
having dealings with <span style="">the </span>Respondent
as if nothing had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, by <span style="">Respondent's own </span>account, which <span style="">was </span>left <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
<span style="">by the Complainant, </span>the former
assisted her <span style="">mother and sisters
prosecute </span>a<span style=""> </span>robbery
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span style="">in</span> March, <span style="">1976, </span>she
secured respondent's services in claiming indemnity from three <span style="">insurance companies </span>when a fire burned
the school down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, respondent was
retained as a collaborating attorney by <span style="">complainant's
</span>family in an inheritance case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These subsequent dealings are far from being the normal reaction of a <span style="">woman who </span>has been wronged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant's contention <span style="">that </span>Respondent continued supporting the child
for several years for which reason she desisted from charging him criminally, <span style="">has </span>not been substantiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truth to tell, the fact that she kept her
peace for so many years can <span style="">even be </span>construed
as a <span class="SpellE">condonation</span> of his alleged "immoral
conduct." It is likewise strange that an unwanted son, as <span style="">the </span>child would normally have been,
should, of <span style="">all names, be called </span>"Jewel."</p>

<p class="BODY">During the investigation before the Provincial Fiscal, <span style="">the </span>complainant, aside from herself,
presented two other witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span> <span style="">Garcia </span>and <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span>
<span class="SpellE">P<span style="">angandaman</span></span><span style="">, </span>both her domestic help, to
testify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the three, it was <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span> who tried to establish the manner <span style="">in </span>which the sexual assault <span style="">took </span>place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You stated
in your affidavit marked Annex A that you heard <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bariñan</span> Tan shouted (sic) for help on the evening of
last week of April, 1971, can <span style="">you tell
me </span>or do you <span class="GramE">know</span> why Mrs. <span style="">Tan shouted for help?</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I responded to the shout for help of Tan
I noticed that Atty. Galileo <span class="SpellE">Trocio</span> hurriedly left
the office leaving behind Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Bariñan</span> Tan.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">Q<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you ask Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bariñan</span> Tan why she was shouting for help?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before I could ask her the reason why she
shouted for help, she told me and <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangandaman</span> that she was sexually abused by Atty. Galileo
J. <span class="SpellE">Trocio</span>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="GramE">Q<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What did you notice of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> <span class="SpellE">Bariñan</span> Tan when you
responded to her shout for help?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="GramE">A<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She was crying and
trying to fix her dress.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> (p.
52-53, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, </span>how near
to the crime scene said witness was, considering that it allegedly happened <span style="">in school</span> <span class="GramE"><span style="">premises,</span></span><span style=""> </span>has not been shown.<span style=""> </span>Her credibility is thus also <span style="">put in issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of <span style="">Complainant
</span>and witness <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mari</span>lou</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pangandaman</span>, <span style="">another
maid, </span><span style="">t</span>o<span style=""> show</span><span style=""> unusual closeness </span>between Respondent and Jewel, like playing <span style="">with him and <span style="">giving </span>him </span>toys, are<span style=""> </span><span style="">not </span>convincing
enough to prove <span style="">paternity, as
Complainant </span><span style="">would want us </span><span style="">to believe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same must be said of Exhibits A, A1, B and B1, which are pictures of
Jewel and the Respondent showing allegedly their physical likeness to each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such evidence is inconclusive to
prove paternity, and much less would it prove violation of Complainant's person
and honor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, Jewel Tan was born in 1972, during wedlock of
Complainant and her husband and the presumption should be <span style="">in </span>favor of legitimacy unless physical
access between the couple was impossible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From the evidence on hand, that presumption has <span style="">not </span>been overcome by adequate and convincing proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span style="">Jewel </span>was registered in his birth certificate as the legitimate
child of the Complainant and her husband, Tan Le <span class="SpellE">Pok</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, this Complaint for disbarment must be, and
is hereby DISMISSED, for lack of convincing substantiation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
