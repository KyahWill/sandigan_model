accused ARNOLD ARGUELLES, alias <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> Sotto; and
that accused BERTITO BACUS, alias <span class="SpellE">Balodoy</span>, had

signified their intention to withdraw their appeal in this case on the grounds
that they had lost interest in pursuing their appeal, that they believed
withdrawal of their appeal would be more advantageous as they could be
qualified for clemency; and, that they could no longer hire a lawyer to pursue
their case, in effect, accepting the judgment of conviction against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This letter prompted the Court to require

<p class="BODY">In his defense, Arnold Arguelles asserted that prosecution
witnesses Police Lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span> Gonzales <span style="">and </span>Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span>
had an "axe to grind" against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Arguelles disclosed that Police Lieutenant <span class="SpellE">Ciriaco</span>
Gonzales <span style="">once </span>caught him dating
his daughter which led to a slapping <span style="">incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As a matter of fact, he alleged that
even after that incident, Police Lieutenant Gonzales used to seek him out, so
that eventually he had <span style="">to </span>leave
school and go back to his hometown of <span class="SpellE">Mauswagon</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
To substantiate this allegation, Arguelles presented a former schoolmate, Jose
Y. <span class="SpellE">Centeno</span>, who testified that he witnessed the
slapping incident and thus corroborated Arguelles' version.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala's</span> testimony
against him, Arguelles presented <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> <span class="SpellE">Delegero</span> to show that <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span>
bore a grudge against him and that <span class="SpellE">Orpiala's</span>
testimony is a mere fabrication, for <span class="SpellE">Delegero</span>
allegedly saw her in <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Mauswagon</span>,
municipality of La <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del Norte on the very day she claimed to have been in Galas-<span class="SpellE">Daku</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> talking to Arguelles.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Arguelles also testified that the reason for Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala's</span>
ill-will towards him stems from an incident sometime in 1966 when they had a
misunderstanding over the payment of alcoholic drinks she was then selling -
which he (Arguelles) refused to pay for - leaving her vowing to take revenge on
him for the same, an incident which <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> <span class="SpellE">Delegero</span> had also witnessed.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court convicted Arguelles and the three (3) other
accused of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
penalty imposed on Arnold Arguelles by the trial court was death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court chose to believe <span class="SpellE">Orpiala's</span> testimony against Arguelles, declaring the
alleged quarrel over the payment of drinks to be hardly possible at the time of
the incident since <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span> was then only sixteen (16)
years of age and too young to dispense and sell alcoholic beverages to adult
drinkers.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court also found impossible that police sergeant Gonzales could have
prodded, coached, persuaded or suggested the inclusion of the name of Arnold
Arguelles in the extrajudicial confessions of accused <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>

for nowhere in their testimonies did they mention anything to that effect, thus
leading the trial court to declare that said three (3) other accused could only
have narrated and defined the direct participation of accused-appellant
Arguelles in the conspiracy and actual commission of the cold-blooded murder of
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Finally, the trial court dismissed appellant Arguelles' alibi as it declared
such alibi to be supported only by his relatives and friends and tailored to
fit unbelievable places, dates and events.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief filed with this Court, Arguelles presents the
following arguments:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court committed reversible error in
considering the extrajudicial confessions of co-accused <span class="SpellE">Bertito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bacus</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Poleran</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abuncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span> as evidence
against accused-appellant Arnold Arguelles for, as against him, said
confessions are hearsay, aside from the fact that said three (3) other accused
retracted said confessions in court, branding them as involuntary for having
been obtained through maltreatment, intimidation and promise of reward or
leniency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arguelles thus submits that the extrajudicial confessions of the <span style="">three </span>(3) other accused should be
deemed inadmissible against him for the settled rule on the matter is that
"extrajudicial statements of an accused implicating a co-accused may not
be utilized against the latter unless repeated in open court."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;"><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant
also faults the trial court's disregard</span> of his alibi notwithstanding the
absence of positive identification of the appellant as one of the perpetrators
of the crime charged by alleged eyewitnesses <span class="SpellE">Agueda</span> <span class="SpellE">Regencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aproniana</span> <span class="SpellE">Legados</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
contends that the evidence for the prosecution merely showed that two (2)
persons went to the house of <span style="">victim </span><span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span> in the early evening of <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="3">17 March 1970</st1:date> <span style="">as </span>narrated by the victim's widow and granddaughter and these
two (2) men had already been positively identified as <span class="SpellE">Bertito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bacus</span> and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Poleran</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arguelles argues that he was never positively <span style="">ident</span>ified as a participant in the
crime, for he was not identified by the victim's granddaughter, <span class="SpellE">Aproniana</span> <span class="SpellE">Legados</span> and that the
identification made by the victim's widow was highly untrustworthy for she
herself had admitted that her eyesight was poor and that she barely recognized
one of the men by his complexion, later identifying the man as <span class="SpellE">Bertito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arguelles suggests that his identification by
the victim's widow could only have been precipitated by the fact that he was
already inside a cell when said identification was done.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Arguelles questions the fact that the granddaughter,
also an eyewitness and more capable of positive identification due to her
unimpaired vision, was never made to identify him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arguelles thus submits that the evidence
presented by the prosecution did not at all prove his identity <span style="">as </span>one of the perpetrators of the
murder in question and therefore his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable
doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief filed by the

extrajudicial confessions (Exhibit 'W') stating that he personally saw appellant

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor General likewise branded as devoid of
merit the contention of appellant Arguelles that he was never properly
identified since Arguelles was positively identified by Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span> as the person she met beside the well of one
Esteban <span class="SpellE">Zamoras</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is, therefore, submitted by the Office of the Solicitor General that
said circumstance taken together with other circumstantial evidence leaves no
room for doubt as to the guilt of appellant Arguelles.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, it would be appropriate to bear in mind the
principle which the 1935, the 1973 as well as the present 1987 Constitution
have enshrined which is, that every person is presumed innocent until the
contrary is proved.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
This constitutional presumption of innocence can be overcome only by proof
beyond reasonable doubt, which is the degree of proof that, after investigation
of the whole record, produces moral certainty in an unprejudiced mind of the
appellant's culpability.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
Such moral certainty is lacking in this case due to the inadmissibility of some
evidence presented by the prosecution and material inconsistencies in the rest
of the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, trial court's findings of fact carry great <span style="">weight </span>for these courts have the
advantage of examining <span style="">the </span>demeanor
of the witnesses while on the witness stand, and therefore, they can discern if
these witnesses are telling the truth or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The exception arises when (1) the conclusions is a finding based
entirely <span style="">on </span>speculations; (2)
the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) there is
grave abuse of discretion; (4) the <span class="SpellE">judgement</span> is based
on a misapprehension of facts; and (5) the court, in making its findings, went
beyond the issues of the case and the same are contrary <span style="">to </span>the admission of both the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The conviction of accused-appellant Arnold Arguelles by the trial
court was grounded on the admission as competent evidence of <span style="">the </span>extrajudicial confessions of the
three (3) other accused, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bertito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Poleran</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abuncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
confessions allegedly point to accused-appellant's presence as well as direct
participation in the murder of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span> on
that fateful evening of <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="3">17 March 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These confessions should, however, have been
deemed inadmissible against accused-appellant Arguelles for said confessions
are hearsay as against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
these confessions were recanted and repudiated by their authors for alleged
maltreatment and/or promise of reward or leniency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, accused-appellant Arguelles never
had the chance to cross-examine the affiants in regard to the contents of their
confessions insofar as they implicated him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact therefore that the trial court chose to give credence to
these confessions as against the confessants [the three (3) other accused in
this case] is irrelevant and immaterial to accused-appellant Arguelles' cause
as "it is a basic rule of evidence that the right of a party cannot <span style="">be </span>prejudiced by an act, declaration

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor General argues that these extrajudicial
confessions should be admissible <span style="">in </span>evidence
against Arguelles for they corroborate facts and/or circumstances duly
established by other evidence, such as the recovery of the .22 caliber slugs in
the body of the victim <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span> and in the crime
scene; the testimony of prosecution witness Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span>
that she saw, met and conversed with accused-appellant Arguelles within the
vicinity of the victim's house on 17 March 1970 with Arguelles allegedly asking
her not to divulge his presence to anyone for reasons which she would learn the
next day; and the testimonies of the granddaughter and the widow that the
murder occurred in the early evening of 17 March 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is submitted by the Office of the
Solicitor General that these circumstances taken together prove beyond doubt
appellant Arguelles' participation in the commission of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded by these submissions for the reason that the
circumstances mentioned only prove that there was indeed a murder committed on <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="3">17 March 1970</st1:date> in the presence of the
victim's granddaughter and widow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
the widow and the granddaughter had positively identified the assailants as the
accused <span class="SpellE">Bertito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span> and
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Poleran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The glaring fact is that both eyewitnesses testified that the two (2)
persons who were the assailants were <span class="SpellE">Bertito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span> and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Poleran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere is it found in their testimonies that
they ever saw accused-appellant Arguelles or, for that matter, any other third
person during the night of the murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged identification by prosecution witness Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span> of accused-appellant Arguelles as the person she
met within the vicinity of the scene of the crime is dubious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, this circumstance is refuted by
defense witness, <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> <span class="SpellE">Delegero</span>
whose testimony included the fact that he had seen Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span> <span style="">in </span>a
different place on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then,
the content of the testimony of Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span>, by
itself, i.e., that Arguelles had confided in her and asked her not to reveal
his presence in the vicinity of the crime, runs counter to criminal behavior <span style="">or </span>to normal human behavior, for that
matter, as not only <span style="">is </span>it
uncharacteristic of a killer about to execute a murder, especially one who had
recruited others to commit a crime, as the prosecution would have us believe,
to talk to anyone prior to the commission of the crime and possibly reveal
something which could make him a suspect, but it also tasks one's imagination
to believe that one (who allegedly eluded capture for seven (7) years) was
talkative and dumb enough to reveal to someone a murder he was about to commit,
that someone being a person whom he once disagreed with over money and who
vowed to take revenge against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming, for the sake of argument that Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span> had indeed seen Arnold Arguelles in the afternoon
of the date of the crime, said circumstance could only be considered
circumstantial and would not at all carry the same weight as would make the
extrajudicial confessions corroborative, for she is not an eyewitness to the
crime like the victim's widow <span class="SpellE">Agueda</span> <span class="SpellE">Regencia</span> <span class="SpellE">vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span> or the victim’s granddaughter, <span class="SpellE">Aproniana</span> <span class="SpellE">Legados</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court refused to believe the occurrence of a previous
quarrel between accused-appellant Arnold Arguelles and prosecution witness
Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span>, striking down as unlikely that <span style="">a </span>sixteen (16) year old girl then
would be dispensing alcoholic drinks to adults.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court's disregard of this matter is <span style="">a </span><span class="SpellE">misjudgement</span> for provincial lasses
have been known to start working, even to get married, at an earlier age than
sixteen (16), so it is not at all unlikely that Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Orpiala</span>
was already dispensing alcoholic drinks at that time and that she could have
had an altercation with accused-appellant Arguelles.</p>

<p class="BODY">Police Lieutenant Gonzales' actions are even more suspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is observed that the first
"lead" that he allegedly uncovered was the violent disagreement of
the victim Vicente <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span> with his brother who <span style="">was </span>by then deceased, and yet the
information which was first filed in the trial court did not even mention the
name <span style="">of </span>the brother's son and
one of the accused herein, <span class="SpellE">Abuncio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumalpong</span> anywhere.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also strange that Police Lieutenant Gonzales never picked
up Arnold Arguelles for questioning upon knowledge of the second
"lead" for the possibility is that he had indeed thought him to be
residing in <span class="SpellE">Mauswagon</span>, La <span class="SpellE">Libertad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another strange thing is that having been
informed of his whereabouts in <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> City where
Arguelles owned a shop bearing his name, he (Gonzales) merely went there once
and having missed Arguelles never returned again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been a simple matter for him to
stake out the flower pot shop until he was able to arrest Arguelles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Arguelles' arrest in the compound of
the headquarters of the Philippine Army is indeed strange for one who is
supposedly in flight would not go to work in an area where his chances of being
caught are magnified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His transfer to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
cannot be considered as "flight", as the trial court so considered,
for Arguelles had not known the reason for the visits by the police and
therefore was not running away from anyone or anything.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Police Lieutenant Gonzales took the statement of <span class="SpellE">Bertito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span>, an unlettered man,
he questioned him in English and then translated the same to <span class="SpellE">Cebuano</span> <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answers given him were in <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> and answers he translated and typed himself in
English.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the taking of the
statement of <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span>, he immediately proceeded with the
reenactment even though the statement was yet to <span style="">be </span>subscribed with the judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There seemed to be too much unnecessary
urgency to conduct said reenactment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is also noted that while it may be true <span style="">that
</span>the alleged confession of <span class="SpellE">Bertito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span> was read to him by City Judge Manuel D. <span class="SpellE">Dalman</span> of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City Court,
Branch I, the Court notes that the alleged confession is in English <span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE">Bertito</span> <span class="SpellE">Bacus</span> is admittedly an unlettered man such that even if the
confession was read back to him he would not have understood a single word no
matter how schooled he was in the "university of experience".</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the evidence of the prosecution against Arnold Arguelles
is sadly lacking the force by which the conviction by the trial court can be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without the confes<span style="">sions of </span>the three (3) other accused
and absent any other direct evidence to prove direct participation in the
crime, the evidence against Arguelles does not prove beyond reasonable doubt
his guilt in the crime charged, as the evidence were, at best, circumstantial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the Rules of Court provide that each of the
following requirements be present to sustain conviction by circumstantial
evidence alone, namely:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is more than one circumstance;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts from which the inferences are
derived are proven; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The combination of all the circumstances is
such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the prosecution has failed to meet the last two (2)
requirements of this rule and for this reason, its case must necessarily fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Courts should generally exercise great care and vigilance to
insure that a verdict of conviction <span style="">is </span>supported
by sufficient and competent evidence and not the result of passion and
prejudice for it is fundamental that the prosecution, to secure conviction for
any crime, must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the
weakness of the defense, as its duty is in demonstrating where culpability
lies.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is the vanguard of people's freedom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its duty is to safeguard the rights of every
person accused of a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may
deprive the accused of his freedom only when proof beyond reasonable doubt is
presented against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phrase
"beyond reasonable doubt" means not a single iota of doubt remains
present in the mind of a reasonable and unprejudiced man that <span style="">a </span>person is guilty of <span style="">a </span>crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in instances where doubt exists, even
if only <span style="">a </span>shred, this Court must
and should set the accused free.</p>
