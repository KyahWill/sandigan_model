<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, according ,to the Solicitor General, are
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Complainant Mary Jane <span class="SpellE">Langga</span> was
residing with her brother <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Langga</span> and the latter's wife and two children of two (2)
years old and eight (8) months old, respectively, at No. 577 <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> Road, Sta. <span class="SpellE">Quiteria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Metro Manila <span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>(pp. 20-21, April 10,
1989; pp. 3-4. April 11, 1989), Appellant Edgar <span class="SpellE">Timbang</span>,
a first cousin of <span class="SpellE">Estelito's</span> wife, also resided with
them sis the spouses' houseboy (pp. 21 &amp; 25, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
April 10, 1989; pp. 3-4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. April 11. 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On January 16, 1989, while complainant's brother and
sister-in-law were both out for work and while she was inside her brother's
room taking care of her two nephews, appellant knocked at the door and
requested permission to get inside the room on the pretext of getting something
(pp. 4-5. 14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, April 11, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside the room, appellant held
complainant's arms and forced her to lie on the wooden bed (pp. 5, 14-15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Despite appellant's poking a knife upon her complainant
fought back to free herself; but appellant was stronger than she (pp. 5 &amp;
7, 15, 18, 19, 26, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could hardly breathe, for appellant was
forcing himself on her and at the same time strangling her (p. 18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even
boxed her on the stomach, placed himself on top of her and continued kissing
her face, lips and neck (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Then, he forcefully removed her skirt and panty and likewise
removed his short pants (pp. 5-6, 17-18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He laid on top of her and inserted his finger
in her vagina followed by his penis (pp. 5-6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he made a push and pull
movement, she felt extreme pain as if her hips were being torn apart (pp. 6-7,
24, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a while, appellant stood up, wore back his short pants
and left complainant lying (p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. ibid.).
Because of the pain she was suffering on her private part, she could not stand
up<span style="text-transform: uppercase;"> </span>(p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since she could do nothing, she
just cried (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After her brother and sister-in-law arrived in the early
evening of that day, complainant did not tell them what happened to her,
because she was afraid of appellant's threat that if she reveals what he had
done to her, he would kill her, her brother, sister-in-law and two nephews (pp.
8 &amp; 9, 22-23. 27, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From January 16, 1989 up to February 25, 1989, except on
Sundays, appellant did the same thing on complainant (p. 20, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.). When she could no longer bear his sexual
assaults, she decided to go to his other brother Fidel <span class="SpellE">Langga</span>
who was residing at <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Palay</span>,
San Jose, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, in the afternoon of February 25,
1989 (pp. 8-9, 23, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival thereat, she narrated to her <span style="" times="" new="" roman="">s</span>ister-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Langga</span>, the wife of his
brother Fidel, her horrible experience in the hands of appellant <span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>(pp.
11-12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, April 10, 1989; pp. 8-9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, April 11, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On February 26, 1989, complainant, accompanied by her
brothers <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> and Fidel and sister-in-law <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>, filed a complaint, of Rape against appellant at
the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Police Headquarters (pp. 4-5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, April 10, 1989; pp. 9-10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

<p class="BODY">The accused, Edgar <span class="SpellE">Timbang</span>, admitted
having sexual intercourse with the complainant on 16 January 1989 and on
several occasions thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he
denied using force or intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
claimed that he and the complainant were lovers and that the act complained of
was done voluntarily or with the consent of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version of the incident is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that he (appellant) became a houseboy of the <span class="SpellE">Langga</span> family sometime September 1988; that it was on (sic)
that house at No. 577 <span class="SpellE">Baesa</span> Road, Sta. <span class="SpellE">Quiteria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City where he
came to know the complainant, the sister of his employer <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Langga</span> and who is likewise residing in that house;
that September 1988 (he) started courting the complainant and on October 1988
they became sweethearts when his love proposal was accepted by her by telling
him '<span class="SpellE">oo</span>, <span class="SpellE">sinasagot</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">kita</span>’; at around 9:00 o'clock
in the morning of January 16, 1989 while she was taking care of the younger
child of <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> in one of the rooms of that house,
she (he) saw complainant Mary Jane entered (sic) the room bringing with her
folded clean clothes; the latter then sat at the edge of the wooden bed and
while sitting thereat, he asked permission from her that he will kiss her and
because the former did not reply (he) kissed Mary Jane on the lips thereafter
both of them removed their respective clothes; he kissed her on her neck and
downward and after about two hours of making love with each other they both
wore back their respective clothes and resumed doing their unfinished household
chores; after that incident, they made love everyday '<span class="SpellE">Inaaraw-araw</span>
<span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">siya</span>': that their
relationship became so intimate in fact, he wag even giving the complainant
additional allowance whenever the latter goes to school; that he did not force
Mary Jane into making <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>love with him; that all the sexual
congress they have done was with her consent until finally on February 25, 1989
when complainant asked permission from him to go to <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
as it was the birthday of her sister-in-law when he even advised her to take
care of herself; for that reason he got surprised on the morning of February
26, 1989 when complainant's brother arrived in the house where he was residing
and confronted him if he was Edgar <span class="SpellE">Timbang</span>; after
admitting that he was Edgar <span class="SpellE">Timbang</span>, the former boxed
him on his face and on his body, he asked for a peace talk but instead he was
kicked by Fidel and because of the force he was thrown in one of the rooms of
the house; he could not stand as he lost his balance so he has (sic) to kneel
down; while he was on (sic) that position, <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span>,
Fidel and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Langga</span>
took their breakfast and after eating he was brought by them at the <span class="SpellE">Sangandaan</span> Police Sub-station; thereat they .were told to
proceed instead at (sic) the <span class="SpellE">Sangandaan</span> Police
Headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City; while on their way to
the upper portion of the headquarters he was again kicked by the brother of
Mary Jane; at the <span class="SpellE">Sangandaan</span> Police Headquarters, he
was detained without the benefit of an investigation; that a picture of Mary
Jane was voluntarily given to him by the former however it bears no dedication
as she, despite his request, did not put a dedication on the said picture;
however, he could no longer produce said picture as his wallet and other
personal belongings were lost as an after result of his being detained at the
City Jail." <a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>(Decision,

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that the complainant, while testifying on
the witness stand, sounded sincere, appeared candid and honest and was direct
to the point and her answers and her testimony were logical, straight-forward
and probable. Her credibility was not shaken despite the vigorous, exhausting and
humiliating cross-examination. The appellant has not shown compelling grounds
to overturn said findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well settled
is the rule that factual findings of the trial court, which had all the
opportunity to observe the behavior and demeanor of the witnesses and weigh all
the evidence presented, are accorded great respect, in the absence of a clear
showing of arbitrariness and misappre­hension of the facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it would appear that the complainant had no malicious
motive to falsely charge the appellant with the commission of so grave an
offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the complainant and the
appellant were sweethearts and the complainant had consented to have sex with
the appellant voluntarily, as the appellant claims, the complainant's most
natural reaction' would be to accept the offer of marriage of the appellant

She would not have denounced the appellant for having raped her if such were
not the fact, considering the dishonor, the shame and the social humiliation
that accompany the accusation and the adverse effect upon her future and that
of her unborn child.</p>

<p class="BODY">The filing of the complaint for rape belies consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the appellant's claim that he
and the complai­nant were sweethearts is not supported by substantial evidence.
And even if they were sweethearts, that fact would not exempt the man from
criminal liability if the sexual intercourse with the woman was against the
latter's will.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes. sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further contends that the failure of the
complainant to report the incident immediately after its commission and their
continued sexual relationship after the commission of the act complained of,
for more than a month after its commission, militate against the complainant's
claim that she was raped.</p>

<p class="BODY">But this has also been satisfactorily explained by the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She declared that the
appellant was threatening to kill her, her two nephews, and her brother if she
should report the incident, and she was afraid.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As for having sexual relationship with the appellant after the
commission of the act complained of, the complainant explained that she also
struggled and resisted the advances of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would hide from the appellant, but the
appellant would follow her wherever she went.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She even tried to lock herself inside the room, but to no avail since
she had to go out of the room sometime.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it would appear from the appellant's testimony that the
subsequent sexual congresses with the complainant were the unilateral acts of
the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After that incident,
did any other incident occur between you and Mary Jane?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I make (sic) love with
her everyday, '<span class="SpellE">Inaaraw-araw</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">siya</span>'.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If the complainant had voluntarily consented to the subsequent
sexual acts, the appellant would have said that <u>they</u>, and not <u>I</u>,
made love everyday, since lovemaking is, by its nature, a consensual act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not commit any reversible error in finding
the appellant guilty of the crime for which he was charged. The indemnity to be
paid to the victim, however, should be reduced to P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
in line with recent decisions of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b>, the
judgment <span style="">appealed </span>from <span style="">is hereby </span>AFFIRMED, with the
modification that the indemnity to be paid to the victim is reduced to P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>. <span class="GramE">With costs.</span></p>
