of this Court's Resolutions of October 11 and 12, 1988, the properties <span style="">in </span>controversy had been sold on
foreclosure and that the GSIS itself was the highest bidder, and that it had
sought a writ of possession with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City (LRC Case No. 3079).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also informed the Court that PVHI and <span class="SpellE">Panlilio</span> had also petitioned the RTC to have the sale

<p class="BODY">On May 9, 1990, Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, etc., in
compliance with our October 27, 1989 Resolution, informed the Court that on
March 26, 1990, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> had approved a
compromise agreement between the parties, founded on the settlement of all of
the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> claims against PVHI and <span class="SpellE">Rebecco</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlilio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 30, 1990, however, the GSIS
informed the Court that the said compromise agreement had been in fact
disapproved by the Commission on Audit and the Office of the President, as a
consequence of which, it had pursued steps to take possession of the properties
by means of the <span style="">writ of possession, and
which, however, PVHI and the <span class="SpellE">Panlilios</span> had sought to
defeat with yet another complaint in the RTC (Civil Case No. 90-52276, Napoleon
<span class="SpellE">Flojo</span>, presiding judge), in the nature of a suit on
the compromise agreement in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The matters before the Court are twofold:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) on the merits, whether or not the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, in issuing the TRO of <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1988</st1:date> is guilty of a grave
abuse <span style="">of discretion to warrant <i>certiorari;</i>
and (2) whether or not the private respondents and/or their counsel have resorted
to forum-shopping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the first, the issue has become moot and academic, the TRO in
question having been lifted as a result of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span>
resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-established that the Court does
not decide moot cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the Court is aware that the matter has since led to a
series of legal entanglements between the parties in various forums--for which
GSIS now charges the <span class="SpellE">Panlilios</span> with
forum-shopping--and the Court is afraid that unless<span style=""> the final word </span>is <span style="">said
and the parties' <span class="SpellE">bickerings</span> put to </span>a <span style="">stop, the question is likely to fester at the
expense of the orderly administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we resolved to give due course to this
petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have held that "forum-shopping" exists
"whenever, as a result of an adverse opinion in one forum, a party seeks a
favorable opinion (other than by appeal on <i>certiorari</i>) in another."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>

The question, <span style="">therefore, for purposes
hereof, </span>is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Did <span class="SpellE">PVHI's</span> twin
actions (in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and before Judge <span class="SpellE">Mabunay</span>, Branch 24, RTC, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, the two public respondents herein) involve
"the same transactions, the same essential facts and circumstances"?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span class="SpellE">Rebecco</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Panlilio</span></span><span style=""> alleged:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">3. There is no question that the instant action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, reversion, accounting, restitution and

of the properties listed in Annex "A" of the complaint, <span style="">some </span>of which are included in the
notices of foreclosure sale issued by deputy sheriff <span class="SpellE">Tijones</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said properties are in <span class="SpellE">custodia</span> <span class="SpellE">legis</span> and subject to the

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, the Court is not minded to hold PVHI, or

counsel, in <span style="">contempt, as</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">prayed
for, on account of forum-shopping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Albeit the two incidents involved the same transactions, that is,
the right of the GSIS to sell or foreclose the mortgaged properties, they did
not involve the same sets of facts or circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Panlilio's</span> motion
with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> was anchored on <span class="SpellE">GSIS's</span> lack of authority to take hold of the assets in
question--not because PVHI owed it nothing--but because these assets were then
in the custody of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, and hence,
beyond the control of anybody else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, PVHI was mistaken, because foreclosure was possible even if the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sandiganbayan</span></span><span style=""> had custody of the properties.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> To be sure, a foreclosure will not divest
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> of its jurisdiction over those
properties, and they remain under <span class="SpellE">custodia</span> <span class="SpellE">legis</span> subject to the resolution of that court as to whether
or not they constitute so-called ill-gotten wealth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Also,
</span><span style="">the buyer acquires them subject
to the risk of losing them later to the real owner, should they be found to be
indeed, "ill-gotten".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that
as it may, <span class="SpellE">PVHI's</span> objection was based on contentions,
although erroneous, that foreclosure was not permissible because the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> had control over the properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">PVHI's</span> suit with the
Regional Trial Court of Manila was essentially to have the obligation itself
declared extinguished, by reason of the fact that it has been paid, and that
hence, PVHI owed GSIS nothing.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would have been different had PVHI sought a ruling from the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> to have that obligation declared paid, and
failing in that, gone to the Regional Trial Court on the same or similar
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that event,
"forum-shopping" would have been a bar to a Regional Trial Court
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that PVHI had prayed for injunction (or temporary
restraining order) in both cases is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we said, <span class="SpellE">PVHI's</span>
prayer for an injunctive writ with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
was sought to be directed against the GSIS for exercising a perceived want of
power on <span class="SpellE">GSIS's</span> part over properties subject matter
of a pending PCGG case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its motion, on
the other hand, with the Regional Trial Court for a w<span style="">rit </span>of injunction was against the very foreclosure proceeding
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no <span style="">forum-shopping to speak of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent <span class="SpellE">PVHI's</span> motion to annul the
foreclosure sale, filed in LRC Case No. 3079 (in which the GSIS asked for a
writ of possession), the Court finds nothing objectionable <span style="">in such a recourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 8, of Act. No. 3135, the remedy
of a party aggrieved </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">foreclosure is indeed, to have the sale set
aside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent <span class="SpellE">GSIS's</span> charges of forum shopping,
embodied in its manifestation dated August 30, 1990, against PVHI <span style="">in </span>connection
with Civil Case No. 90-52272, instituted to enforce the compromise agreement
(by way of specific performance) and to enjoin GSIS from taking possession of
the mortgaged assets in question and from consolidating title thereto in its
name, it is necessary for GSIS to file<span style="">
