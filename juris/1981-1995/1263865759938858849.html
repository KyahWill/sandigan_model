single, testifying for his defense, denied the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of </span>the execution of his
confession although he admitted most of the answers therein which were
apparently <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">favorable to </span>him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>his

of him and he was left alone when he noticed a person who seemed to be a rebel
because he pretended to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">be a </span>military,
wearing a belt and a hat, but afraid of soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He bumped him so he asked him where he came
from and if he was a soldier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
answered that he came from Carmen, <st1:place>North <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place>,

arrested him, boarded a tricycle and brought him to their headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they were about to reach their

a result of which, the man lost consciousness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When he regained, he directed him to be brought to the headquarters for
interrogation but he still refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
that time Rico <span class="SpellE">Aranilla</span> and Mauro Rosario passed by
so he asked them to help him bring the victim to their headquarters, but the
duo refused to do so because it was already time and that they will just send
somebody to help him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While waiting, the
deceased ran away <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">so </span>he chased
him at a distance of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">about two (2) </span>kilometers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He overtook him and asked him why he was not
going with him to the headquarters when he was not harming him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deceased answered that he has no fault,
at the same time boxing him, hitting his breast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They exchanged blows again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the deceased was at the losing end of the
fist fight, tried to get a piece of stick (seventeen inches long and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">little
bit </span>smaller than his forearm), he grappled with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he had wrested it, he struck him with it
on his head, causing him to fall to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unconscious, he left him and reported to Lt. <span class="SpellE">Licodine</span>,
his Platoon <span class="GramE">Leader, that</span> he had mauled a civilian
suspected to be a rebel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was placed

to cut his neck." At that </span>time, the victim was already being mauled
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the mauling continued until the
victim lost consciousness and later died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The resolution to kill was therefore, made only upon the utterance of
the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>When the victim lay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">unconscious, </span>the accused left and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">went to their </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He reported to his </span>superior <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that
he had mauled a civilian and left him unconscious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The whole evening, the accused just stayed </span>in
their headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these
circumstances, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">evident premeditation is
clearly not present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The time when the
accused determined to commit the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">crime
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was not established nor was
there sufficient time and opportunity for the accused to deliberate on the
meaning and the consequences of his act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstances of cruelty and taking advantage of
public position were, however, correctly appreciated by the trial court.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the incident, the accused was an army draftee and
was in full army fatigue uniform.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
on account of his being an army man that he arrested the victim on the pretext
that the latter was a rebel and brought him to the ranch of <span class="SpellE">Felomino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lanoy</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">where
the victim was mauled to death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Cruelty was clearly present considering that the accused
deliberately prolonged the suffering of the victim by boxing and kicking him in
a malevolent manner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He even ordered the
victim to strip naked and take a bath.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>With the contusions and abrasions on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">victim's body and the mental torment that must have accompanied this
unusual order in the midst of a beating, the bath surely caused him excruciating
pain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not contented with this, the
accused continued to </span>inflict on the victim after the bath, a barrage of
fist blows and kicks.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the qualifying circumstance of evident
premeditation was not sufficiently proved, the crime committed by the accused
is therefore, only homicide with the aggravating circumstances of cruelty and
taking advantage of public position and with the mitigating circumstances of
voluntary surrender and the analogous circumstance of passion and obfuscation
because of an outraged feeling, believing the deceased to be a rebel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 15 Decision)</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty prescribed for the offense of Homicide is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">paid to the heirs of the victim shall
also be increased to P30<span class="GramE">,000.000</span> in line </span>with
