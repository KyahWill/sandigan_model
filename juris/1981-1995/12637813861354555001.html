				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In Criminal Case No. 83-20146 of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, National Capital Region, Branch 55, the appellant Nenita Quizon y Katipunan was charged with violation of Section 4, Article II, in relation to Section 21, Article IV of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended, allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about August 25, 1983, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to sell, deliver, give away to another or distribute any prohibited drug, did then and there wilfully and unlawfully sell, deliver or give away to another fifteen (15) sticks of cigarette containing marijuana, which is a prohibited drug."</blockquote>Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty, and thereafter, trial proceeded and the prosecution as well as the defense presented their respective evidence.<br><br>The prosecution presented in evidence, in addition to the testimonies of Pat. Jesus Gesolfon III, Patrolwoman Susan Mendez, P/Lt. Reynaldo Jaylo and P/Sgt. Herminio Siochi, all of the Special Anti-Narcotics Group, Auxiliary Services Bureau, Western Police District, Metropolitan Police Force and Edwin C. Purificando, NBI Forensic Chemist, the extrajudicial confessions of appellant, wherein she admitted the commission of the offense imputed to her.<br><br>Testifying in her own behalf, appellant repudiated her extrajudicial confessions, claiming that she was forced to sign them.<br><br>The trial court convicted her of the crime charged primarily on the basis of her extrajudicial confessions, and sentenced her "to suffer the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT with the accessory penalties provided by the law and to pay a fine of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00), plus the costs."<br><br>Appellant' interposed the present appeal, contending that --<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"I<br></div><br>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN DURING THE TRIAL OF THIS CASE IT EXPOSED ITSELF WITH MANIFEST AND CLEAR BIAS AND PREJU­DICE AGAINST THE ACCUSED.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"II<br></div><br>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO CONSIDER THE TESTIMONIAL INCONSISTENCIES AND CONTRADICTIONS OF PROSECU­TION WITNESSES TO BE MATERIAL.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"III<br></div><br>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE THE MONEY BILLS MARKED EXHIBITS 'H' AND 'H-1'.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"IV<br></div><br>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT ADMITTED IN EVIDENCE THE ALLEGED EXTRA­JUDICIAL CONFESSIONS OF THE ACCUSED.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"V<br></div><br>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN FAILING TO APPRECIATE THE CLAIM OF THE DEFENSE THAT THE MARIJUANA AND THE TWO MONEY BILLS ARE PLANTED EVIDENCE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">"VI<br></div><br>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING NENITA QUIZON GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF VIOLATION OF SECTION 4, ARTICLE II IN RELATION TO SECTION 21, ARTICLE IV OF THE DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT OF 1972, AS AMENDED."</blockquote>In his MANIFESTATION IN LIEU OF APPELLEE'S BRIEF, the Solicitor General agrees with appellant and recommends that she be acquitted on the ground that the evidence extant in the record of this case has not established her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In the said manifestation he summarized the evidence of the prosecution and that of the defense, as follows:<br><blockquote>"A.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Version of the Prosecution</i><br><br>"On August 25, 1983 at about 7:30 o'clock in the evening, Lt. Alfredo Lazarte, Officer-in-Charge of the Auxiliary Services Bureau, Special Anti-Narcotics Group of the Western Police District, received information that a certain woman and her cohorts were selling marijuana in Almario St., Tondo, Manila.&nbsp; (p. 16, tsn, December 14, 1983)<br><br>"Acting on the aforesaid information, Lt. Lazarte dispatched a team of policemen headed by Sgt. Herminio Siochi with the express instruction to entrap a certain Melda, the woman allegedly engaged in the sale of marijuana.&nbsp; (p. 17, tsn, December 14, 1983)<br><br>"Thus bidden, the said team of policemen proceeded to Almario St., Tondo, Manila. Patrolman Gesolfon and Patrolwoman Mendez were specifically assigned the task of entrapping the supposed marijuana seller.&nbsp; (p. 17, tsn, December 14, 1983)<br><br>"The testimonies, however, of Gesolfon and Mendez as to where the entrapment was made, who did the buying from the appellant, who effected the arrest and when such arrest was effected was made do not jibe with each other.&nbsp; Hence, their narrations on these mate­rial points will be separately discussed.<br><br>“a. <i>Gesolfon's declaration</i><br><br>"Upon reaching Almario St., Gesolfon, Mendez and informant saw the appellant Nenita Quizon in <span style="font-style: italic;">front</span> of her house and they approached her.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Mendez</span> told appel­lant that she wanted to buy 15 sticks of marijuana cigarettes from her.&nbsp; After receiving the cigarettes from appellant, Mendez handed her two marked bills, one P10-bill and one P5-bill.&nbsp; At this point, Gesolfon said, 'I am a police officer, you are under arrest.'&nbsp; Appellant was then brought to police headquarters for investigation.&nbsp; (pp. 18-26, tsn, December 14, 1983)<br><br>“b. <i>Mendez' narrative</i><br><br>"When they reached Almario St., Gesolfon, Mendez and the informant pro­ceeded to the appellant's house.&nbsp; The informant preceded the two in going up the <i>second floor</i> of the appellant's house.&nbsp; The informant told the appellant they wanted to buy marijuana.&nbsp; Appellant brought out 15 sticks of marijuana which she gave to Gesolfon.&nbsp; Gesolfon handed money to her after receiving the fifteen (15) sticks of marijuana.&nbsp; At this point, Mendez gave a signal to their companions along Almario Street.&nbsp; The latter responded by moving into the house of the appellant.&nbsp; Then, Lt. Jaylo arrested her. (pp. 9-11, 14, 15 &amp; 18, tsn, February 15, 1984)<br><br>"The appellant was brought to the police headquarters where she was made to execute a statement (Exh. E and E-1) in which it would appear that she admit­ted her complicity in the crime imputed her.&nbsp; The following day, she executed another statement (Exh. E-2).<br><br>"B. <i>Version of the Defense</i><br><br>"On the night of August 25, 1983, the appellant was inside their house located at 766 R. Almario St., Dagupan, Tondo, Manila, putting a baby to sleep when suddenly three (3) policemen barged into their house.&nbsp; They demanded of her to bring out the marijuana allegedly in her possession but which she denied having any.&nbsp; The policemen then forced her to go with them.&nbsp; One of them whom she recognized as Pat. Gesolfon poked a gun at her.&nbsp; (p. 34, tsn, April 4, 1984)<br><br>"At the police precinct, the appellant was brought to a room by Patrolwoman Mendez who stripped off appellant's pants and searched her body for marijuana.&nbsp; Patrolwoman Mendez found nothing from her.&nbsp; Barely one (1) hour thereafter, she (appellant) was forced to execute a statement before Mendez admitting the charge levelled against her.&nbsp; The policemen did this by shouting at her and threatening her that she will rot in jail if she does not give her statement.&nbsp; The policemen did not allow her to read the statement, but instead forced her to sign it without knowing its content.&nbsp; She was afraid and nervous during that time.&nbsp; (pp.4-6, tsn, April 4, 1984)<br><br>"The following day, while still under detention, the appellant was again investigated, this time by Pat. Jaylo.&nbsp; The latter forced her to sign a statement, shouting bad words at her like '<i>Putang Ina mo, pag hindi mo pinirmaan ito</i>' and at the same time pulling his sidearm.<br><br>"Corroborating the appellant's testimony, Maricel Uranyeza testified that she was at the appellant's house using the latter's telephone while Nenita (appellant) was putting her nephew to sleep.&nbsp; She saw three (3) persons wearing civilian clothes enter the house.&nbsp; They asked Nenita Quizon where <i>Imelda Quizon's</i> house was.&nbsp; Nenita informed them that Imelda lives in the house.&nbsp; Whereupon, the men insisted that Nenita was Imelda and they forced Nenita to go with them.&nbsp; Seeing this happen, Uranyeza got afraid and ran downstairs where she was confronted by one of the policemen.&nbsp; However, she told him that she did nothing wrong and went to the appellant's house only to use their phone.&nbsp; Hearing this, the police let her go.&nbsp; (pp. 4-5, tsn, March 19, 1984)<br><br>"Uranyeza also executed a 'Sinum­paang Salaysay' on September 1983 categorically contradicting the events as narrated by the police officers that led to the arrest of the appellant (Exh. 'I')."</blockquote>As previously stated, appellant was convicted primarily on the basis of her alleged extra-judicial confessions.&nbsp; Appellant and the Solicitor General contend that the said extra-judicial confessions are inadmissible in evidence because appellant was not fully apprised of her constitutinal right to counsel.&nbsp; (Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Cons­titution)<br><br>We agree.&nbsp; As aptly observed by the Solicitor General -?<br><blockquote>"The appellant's extra-judicial confession executed on the night of her arrest (Exhibits 'E' and 'E-1') is prefaced as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="28%"><div align="justify">'TANONG: </div></td> <td width="72%"><div align="justify">Nais mo bang magbigay ng kusang loob na salaysay at sagutin ng buong katotohanan lahat ng itatanong namin sa iyo na hindi ka namin tinatakot, sinasaktan, o pinangakuan ng anumang pabuya at dapat mong malaman ang lahat ay sasabihin mo dito ay maaring gamitin laban o pabor sa iyo at kanino mang tao sa alin mang hukuman sa ating bayan at dapat mo ring malaman na sa pagsisiyasat na ito karapatan mong magkaroon ng mananaggol at ang karapatan mo sa ilalim ng Saligang Batas ay maari kang huwag sumagot sa itatanong namin sa iyo kung gusto mo.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">'SAGOT:</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Opo.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">'TANONG: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Samakatuwid, magbigay ka nang malayang salaysay kahit na wala kang manananggol?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">'SAGOT: </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Opo.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td style="text-align: right;">‘(SGD) NENITA K.

Jaylo intimidated her into signing the questioned statement by shouting bad words at her and pulling his gun from his waist.&nbsp; This was not rebutted by Pat. Jaylo.<br><br>"Considering, therefore, the circumstances under which the appellant's subsequent extra-judicial confession was executed, it stands discredited in the eyes of the law and is a thing that never existed.&nbsp; (<i>People vs. Urro,</i> 44 SCRA 473 [1972])."<br></blockquote>Only recently, this Court had the occasion to rule that --<br><blockquote>"When the Constitution requires a person under investigation 'to be informed' of his rights to remain silent and to counsel, it must be presumed to contemplate the transmis­sion of meaningful information rather than just the ceremonial and perfunctory recitation of an abstract constitutional principle.&nbsp; As a rule, therefore, it would not be sufficient for a police officer just to repeat to the person under investigation the provisions of Section 20, Article IV of the Constitution.&nbsp; He is not only duty-bound to tell the person the rights to which the latter is entitled; he must also explain their effects in practical terms, e.g., what the person under interrogation may or may not do, and in a language the subject fairly understands.&nbsp; (See <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Ramos, </span>122 SCRA 312; <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Caguioa, </span>95 SCRA 2).&nbsp; In other words, the right of a person under interrogation 'to be informed' implies a correlative obligation on the part of the police investigator to explain, and contemplates an effective communication that results in understanding what is conveyed.&nbsp; Short of this, there is a denial of the right, as it cannot truly be said that the person has been 'informed' of his rights.&nbsp; Now, since the right 'to be informed' implies comprehension, the degree of explanation required will necessarily vary, depending upon the education, intelligence and other relevant personal circumstances of the person under investigation.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that a simpler and more lucid explanation is needed where the subject is unlettered.&nbsp; (<i>People vs. Nicandro,</i> G.R. No. 59378, February 11, 1986; <i>People vs. Duhan, </i>et al., G.R. No. 65189, May 28, 1986)</blockquote>Moreover, the ruling in <i>People vs. Galit</i> (135 SCRA 465, 472), to the effect that the right to counsel may be waived but the waiver shall not be valid unless made with the assistance of counsel, clearly applies to the case at bar.<br><br>The Solicitor General also joins with appellant in assailing the trial court for giving weight and credence to the testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution which are contradictory and inconsistent on material points, thus casting serious doubts as to the truth of the alleged entrapment.<br><br>Again, We agree.&nbsp; As observed by the Solicitor General -?<br><blockquote>"x x x.&nbsp; There are several material inconsistencies in the testimonies of the police officers raising serious doubts as to the truth of the supposed entrapment.&nbsp; Significant portions of Pat.

Jaylo after receiving a signal coming from her.<br><br>"(4) Gesolfon narrated that the 15 sticks of marijuana cigarettes were already with the appellant when they saw her in front of the latter's house.&nbsp; Mendez, on the other hand, stated that the appellant had yet to get the cigarettes <i>from a room</i> on the second floor of the said appellant's house.<br><br>"Further inconsistencies are correctly pointed out by the appellant in her brief, to wit:<br><br>"1. During his direct examination, Pat. Gesolfon, declared that the appellant gave the marked money only <i>after</i> her investigation at the police headquarters (p. 21, tsn, December 14, 1983, lines 10-11).&nbsp; On the other hand, Patrolwoman Mendez claimed that she immediately retrieved the money from the appellant after handing it to her (p. 18, tsn, February 15, 1984, lines 12-16).<br><br>"2. Gesolfon narrated that it was <i>Patrolwoman Mendez</i> who asked the accused: '<i>Oh, mayroon ba tayo</i>' (p. 25, tsn, December 14, 1984).&nbsp; For her part, Mendez testified that the informant did the asking of marijuana from the appellant (p. 15, tsn, February 15, 1984).<br><br>"3. Pat. Gesolfon admitted during his cross-examination that he was armed with a .38 Cal. gun when the alleged entrapment took place (p. 27, tsn, December 14, 1983).&nbsp; When presented as a rebuttal witness, Lt. Jaylo, however, maintained that Gesolfon was unarmed.&nbsp; Rather, it was Patrolwoman Mendez who was armed (p. 12, tsn, April 26, 1984).<br><br>"4. The police crime report (Exhibit 'C') does not specifically mention the name of the appellant, Nenita, as one of those furnished by the informant allegedly engaged in selling marijuana, but 'Melda and cohorts'.&nbsp; In her testimony, however, Patrolwoman Mendez declared that 'our informant told us that the marijuana was bought from Melda and Nenita Quizon.&nbsp; (p. 17, tsn, February 14, 1984)<br><br>"Indeed, if there was an entrapment actually conducted by Gesolfon and Mendez against the appellant, why would these police officers' testimonies relative thereto differ on<i> material </i>points? This fact sufficiently raises doubt as to the truth of the alleged entrapment which engenders a reasonable degree of doubt as to the appellant's guilt.&nbsp; This is one vital fact of substance which the lower court overlooked, and provides basis for reversal.&nbsp; Thus, as reiterated in People vs. Pagkaliwagan, 36 SCRA 113 (1970):<br><br>'And while the Court on Appeal would normally not disturb the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses in view of the latter's advantage of observing at first hand their demeanor in giving their testimony, <i>the Court has consistently held that this rule of appreciation of evidence must bow to the superior and immutable rule that the guilt of the accused must be proved&nbsp; beyond reasonable doubt, because&nbsp; the law presumes that a defendant is innocent and this presumption must prevail unless overturned by competent and credible proof.</i>' (Emphasis Supplied.)<br><br>"The testimony of defense witness Leticia Limano is,
