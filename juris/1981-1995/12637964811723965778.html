simply referred to as the CENTRAL) as a laborer, picking up strewn cane, during
the 1946-1947 milling season.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Starting

because he began to spit blood at this </span>time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An x-ray examination conducted by the <span class="SpellE">CENTRAL's</span> physician revealed that <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span>
was suffering from minimal pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in the right lung.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was consequently confined at the <span class="SpellE">CENTRAL's</span> hospital, pursuant to a collective bargaining
agreement then in force, but after three (3) days, he refused further treatment
and at his request was discharged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> then opted to retire, and the
CENTRAL paid him P400.00 as gratuity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1960" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1960</st1:date>, he executed
an affidavit affirming his voluntary refusal to be treated at the <span class="SpellE">CENTRAL's</span> hospital.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Three years later, or more precisely on <st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1963</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span>
filed a complaint <span class="SpellE">aganst</span> the CENTRAL with Regional
Office No. 4 of the Department of Labor at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
seeking disability compensation and reimbursement of medical expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The CENTRAL moved to dismiss, alleging that <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> was statutorily barred from presenting and
prosecuting his claim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Hearing Officer to whom the case was assigned rendered a
decision on <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1965</st1:date>
dismissing the case for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The decision pointed out that <span class="SpellE">Tanio's</span> averment
of having spat blood was corroborated by neither an eyewitness nor medical
proof; there was no showing of any resulting disability for labor; and proof of
illness alone does not entitle an employee to compensation under the Workmen's
Compensation Act.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span>, the Workmen's
Compensation Commission reversed the judgment of the Hearing Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It declared that since <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span>
was healthy when first admitted for employment by the CENTRAL and he was
afterwards found to be suffering from minimal PTB, the presumption was that his
illness had been caused or aggravated by his employment, a presumption that had
not been overthrown by the evidence on record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It accordingly ordered the CENTRAL to pay <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span>
P4,000.00 as disability compensation; P1,300.00 as reimbursement for medical
expenses; P400.00 as attorney's fees, and P41.00 as costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also commanded the CENTRAL to provide
medical services to <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> until his illness was
cured.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Subsequently, in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="9">September
 27, 1968</st1:date>, the Commission denied the <span class="SpellE">CENTRAL’s</span>
motion for reconsideration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
However, the Medical Member of the Commission dissented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to her, <span class="SpellE">Tanio's</span>
PTB was minimal, was not in an aggravated stage at all but was in fact just
beginning, hence, there could be no causal relation between <span class="SpellE">Tanio's</span>
illness and his employment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The CENTRAL has filed a petition with us for the review of the
Commission's judgment in accordance with Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, seeking
to persuade us that the latter has decided a question of substance not
theretofore determined by us or decided it in a way not in accord with law or
our applicable decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said
petitioner submits the following particular issues:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not the Regional Office No. 4,
stationed in Manila, had jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE">Tanio's</span>
claim; (2) the proper interpretation of Sections 24 and 45 (paragraph 2) of Act
3428, otherwise known as the Workmen's Compensation Act; (3) whether or not <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> was entitled to reimbursement of medical expenses
notwithstanding his voluntary waiver of <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
medical treatment; and (5) whether or not attorney's fees were correctly
awarded despite the absence of any prayer <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in
<span class="SpellE">Tanio's</span> complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CENTRAL maintains that Regional Office No. 4 stationed at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
is, under the law, without authority to entertain the claim and that <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> having admitted he is a resident of Bo. Talon, San
Luis, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, only Regional Office No. 5 could
validly assume jurisdiction over the claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 1, Rule 16 of the Rules of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission, a claim for compensation may be filed and heard in the
regional office of any of the following places:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>where the accident occurred; where the claimant, or any of the claimants
resides; or where the respondent or any of the respondents, resides, at the
option of the claimant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The choice of
any of these venues is solely the claimant's.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> having opted to file his claim
for compensation at the Regional Office No. 4, stationed at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
and it having been established that <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> was
residing at Sta. Cruz, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, at
the time of such filing, Regional Office No. 4 validly assumed jurisdiction
over the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the rule
is to foster the convenience of the claimant considering that he is the
aggrieved party.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The CENTRAL contends that in order to maintain an action under
the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, it was necessary for <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> to file with said employer notice of his illness and
claim for compensation within two months after learning of such illness, as
prescribed by Section 24 of the Act; and that, not having done this, his cause of
action, if any, had already prescribed when he filed the compensation claim
herein with the Department of Labor, Regional Office No. 4, on October 8, 1963,
three years and some seven months after he first learned that he had
tuberculosis and chose to retire.</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention is without merit, there being no dispute that as
soon as he exhibited the first symptoms of his ailment, which the <span class="SpellE">CENTRAL’s</span> physician diagnosed as minimal PTB, <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> was confined and treated at the <span class="SpellE">CENTRAL's</span>
expense at the latter's hospital for at least three days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The employer's act of extending and paying
for medical assistance suffices for and obviates the necessity of giving him
the notice required by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as we
have consistently ruled that compensation claims accruing under the Workmen's
Compensation Act and prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
Labor Code of 1974 prescribe in ten years,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
so we have also held that delay or failure to give the employer notice of
compensable illness or injury within the prescribed period does not bar a claim
for compensation if it is shown that the latter, his agent or representative in
fact knew of such injury or illness or that he suffered no damage by reason of
such delay or lack of notice.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Whether, considering the nature of the private respondent's
employment, minimal PTB is a compensable illness in his case, is also a settled
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we held in <span class="SpellE">Villones</span> vs. Employees' Compensation Commission<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Moreover, this Court, in consistently holding that the
disease of tuberculosis is an occupational disease or work-connected in such
occupations as that of a teacher, laborer, driver, land inspector and such
other occupations, hence compensable, aptly stated and WE quote:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'Medical science has it that tuberculosis as
an ailment is latent in man regardless of his age, sex and occupation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When given favorable conditions this disease
becomes active and prominent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of
these favorable conditions are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>too much
physical exertion without the corresponding rest; exposure to excessive heat
and cold; lack of good food as to weaken the body constituents and contact with
people suffering from tuberculosis ***' (<span class="SpellE">Corales</span> vs.
ECC, supra)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the CENTRAL having failed to comply with the mandatory
requirement of Section 45 of the Workmen's Compensation Act to controvert <span class="SpellE">Tanio's</span> claim within the limiting periods established in
said section,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
it is deemed to have waived by operation of law its right to controvert said
respondent's claim on non-jurisdictional grounds.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, we find the <span class="SpellE">CENTRAL's</span>
allegation that the Commission erred in awarding attorney's fees without a
prayer for such fees and evidence to justify an award thereof, devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span> Don Pedro
v. <span class="SpellE">Agno</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
cited by the CENTRAL, is no longer applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The insertion of the phrase "which shall be chargeable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">against the employer" </span>in Section
31 of the Workmen's Compensation Law by Rep. Act 4119, which was approved June
30, 1964 clearly indicates the intention of the law to make attorney's fees an
integral part of the compensation or benefits due the employee or his
dependents under the Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As said
Section 31 fixes the amount of the attorney's fees that may be recovered,
prayer for such relief and proof thereof are no longer necessary.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We, however, find that the Commission incurred in legal error in
awarding reimbursement for medical expenses and ordering that <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> be given medical services until his illness is
cured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As already observed, after three
days of confinement following discovery of his illness, <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span>
had refused further treatment and was discharged from petitioner's hospital at
his own request, a fact he later confirmed in a sworn statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right of a disabled employee to medical
attendance under Section 13 of the Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, can
be impugned or abated if he unreasonably refuses to accept the medical services
proffered by the employer, or if he shall voluntarily impede or obstruct such
services.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, modified only by striking <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the award of P1,300.00 to reimburse medical expenses incurred by <span class="SpellE">Tanio</span> as well as the order that he be extended medical
services until he is cured of his illness, the decision under review is
affirmed in all other respects, with costs against Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
Don Pedro.</p>
