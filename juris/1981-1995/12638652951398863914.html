</span>The plan was hatched about two days before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused were armed with homemade guns and
a hand grenade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they entered the establishment,
they met <span class="SpellE">Rodita</span> <span class="SpellE">Habiero</span>, an
employee thereat who was on her way out for her meal break and announced to her
that it was a hold-up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was made to
go back to the office and there Appellant <span class="SpellE">Salvilla</span>
pointed his gun at the owner, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Choco</span>, and his two daughters, Mary and <span class="SpellE">Mimie</span>,
the latter being a minor 15 years of age, and told the former that all they
needed was money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hearing this, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> told his daughter, Mary, to get a paper bag
wherein he placed P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> cash (P5,000.00,
according to the defense) and handed it to Appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
pleaded with the four accused to leave the premises as they already had the
money but they paid no heed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
accused <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Canasares</span>
took the wallet and wristwatch of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> after
which the latter, his two daughters, and <span class="SpellE">Rodita</span>, were
herded to the office and kept there as hostages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The four accused also took turns
eating while the others stood guard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then, Appellant told <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> to produce P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> so he and the other hostages could </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">released.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Severino</span> answered that he could not do so
because it was a Saturday and the banks </span>were closed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In the meantime, police
and military authorities had surrounded the premises of the lumber yard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Major <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> B.
<span class="SpellE">Sequio</span>, Station Commander of the INP of Iloilo City,
negotiated with the accused using a loud </span>speaker and appealed to them to
surrender with the assurance that no harm would befall them as he would
accompany them personally to the police station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused refused to surrender or to
release the hostages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, OIC Mayor, Rosa <span class="SpellE">Caram</span>, of <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> arrived and joined the

accused, which lasted for about four hours, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Appellant </span>demanded P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, a
coaster, and some raincoats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She offered
them P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> instead, explaining the difficulty of
raising more as it was a Saturday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later, the accused agreed to receive the same and to release <span class="SpellE">Rodita</span> to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>accompanied

</span></span>When they were already out of the door, one of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused </span>whose face was covered by a
handkerchief, gave a key to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Caram</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With this, Mayor <span class="SpellE">Caram</span>
unlocked the padlocked door and handed to <span class="SpellE">Rodita</span> the
P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, which the latter, in turn, gave to one of
the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rodita</span>
was later set free but Mary was herded back to the office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mayor <span class="SpellE">Caram</span>, Major <span class="SpellE">Sequio</span>,
and even volunteer radio newscasters continued to appeal to the accused to
surrender peacefully but they refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ultimatums were given but the accused did not budge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the police and military authorities
decided to launch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an </span>offensive
and assault the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This resulted in
injuries to the girls, <span class="SpellE">Mimie</span> and Mary <span class="SpellE">Choco</span> as well as to the accused <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>
and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Canasares</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mary suffered a "macerated right lower
extremity just below the knee" so that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">her </span>right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">leg </span>had
to be amputated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The medical certificate
described her condition as “in a state of hemorrhagic shock when she was
brought in to the hospital and had to undergo several major operations during
the course of her confinement from <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="4">April

but was given only P5,000.00, which he placed on the counter of the office of
the lumber yard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that he and
his co-accused kept <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>, his daughters, and <span class="SpellE">Rodita</span> inside the office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He maintained, however, that he stopped his co-accused from getting the
wallet and wristwatch of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> and, like the P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, were all left on the </span>counter, and were never
touched by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed further that
they had never fired <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">on </span>the
military because they intended to surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's version also was that during the gunfire, <span class="SpellE">Severino's</span> daughter stood up and went outside; he wanted to
stop her but he himself was hit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by a
bullet and could not prevent her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">they
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">gave themselves up only much

sentenced each of the accused "to suffer the penalty of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, with the accessory penalties provided by law and
to pay the costs."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Salvilla's</span> present appeal is
predicated on the following Assignments of Error:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court
erred in holding that the crime charged was consummated and in not holding that
the same was merely attempted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court
erred in not appreciating the mitigating circumstance of voluntary
surrender."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span>Upon the facts and the evidence, we
affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense contends that "The complete crime of larceny
(theft/robbery) as distinguished from an attempt requires <span class="SpellE">asportation</span>
or carrying away, in addition to the taking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the crime of robbery/theft has three consecutive
stages:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) the giving 2) the taking and
3) the carrying away or <span class="SpellE">asportation</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And without <span class="SpellE">asportation</span>
the crime committed is only attempted" (Memorandum for Appellant <span class="SpellE">Salvilla</span>, Records, p. 317).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that in robbery, it is required that there
be a taking of personal property belonging to another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is known as the element of <span class="SpellE">asportation</span>, the essence of which is the taking of a thing
out of the possession of the owner without his <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
and consent and without the <u>animus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>revertendi</u></span>
(<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Revised Penal Code, p. 97, citing 5 C.J.
607).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, if there is no actual
taking, there can be no robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unlawful taking of personal property of another is an essential part of
the crime of robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant insists that while the "giving" has been <span class="GramE">proven,</span> the "taking" has not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And this is because neither he nor his three
co-accused touched the P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> given by <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> nor the latter's wallet or watch during the entire
incident; proof of which is that none of those items were recovered from their
persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Those factual allegations are contradicted by the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rodita</span>, the
lumberyard employee, testified that upon demand by Appellant, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> put P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> inside a
paper bag and subsequently handed it to Appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In turn, accused <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canasares</span> took the wallet and wristwatch of <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Severino</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>In
respect of the P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from Mayor <span class="SpellE">Caram</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rodita</span> declared that the
Mayor handed the amount to her after she (the Mayor) had opened the padlocked
door and that she thereafter gave the amount to one of the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The "taking" was, therefore,
sufficiently proved (TSN, July 1, 1987, pp. 12-13, 15-16, 27-31).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The money demanded, and the wallet and wrist
watch were within the dominion and control of the Appellant and his co-accused
and completed the taking.</p>

<blockquote>"The State established a 'taking' sufficient to support a
conviction of robbery even though the perpetrators were interrupted by police
and so d<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">id </span><u>not</u> <u>pick</u>

from the female clerk of a convenience store, and the clerk had complied with
their instructions and placed money from the register in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>paper bag and then placed the bag on
the counter in front <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of </span>the two

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">It is no defense <span class="GramE">either that Appellant and</span> his co-accused had no opportunity

</span>That fact </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">does </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not affect the nature of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the moment the offender gained

<blockquote>"The crime is consummated when the robber acquires possession

property be taken into the hands of the robber, or that he should have actually
carried the property away, out of the physical presence of the lawful
possessor, or that he should have made his escape with it" (People vs.
Quinn, 176 P 2d 404; Woods vs. State, 220 SW 2d 644; People vs. Beal, 39 P 2d
504; People vs. Clark, 160 P 2d 553).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Contrary to Appellant's
submission, therefore, a conviction for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In the last analysis, the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Anent the second

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The "surrender"
by the Appellant and his co-accused hardly meets these requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were, indeed, asked to surrender </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the police and military authorities but
they refused until only much later when they could no longer do otherwise by

accused was held not to be mitigating as when he gave up only after he was
surrounded by the constabulary and police forces (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sigayan</span>, et al., G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-18523-26, </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="4"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

no voluntary surrender to speak of (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimdiman</span>,

<p class="BODY">All told, the assigned errors remain unsubstantiated and we find
the guilt of the accused-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Salvilla</span>, established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although unassigned as an error, we deem it necessary to turn now
to the nature of the linked offenses involved and the penalty imposed by the
Trial Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant and his co-accused were charged in the Information with
"Robbery with Serious Physical Injuries and Serious Illegal Detention
("Art. <span class="GramE">295, par. 3, in conjunction with Art.</span> 267,
RPC"), and sentenced to <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We
agree with the Trial Court that a complex crime under Article 48 of the Revised
Penal Code has been committed such that the penalty for the more serious
offense of Serious Illegal Detention (Art. 267, Revised Penal Code), or “</span><u>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">
to death," is to be imposed instead of the penalty prescribed for Robbery
with Serious Physical Injuries (Art. 294 (3), which is <u>reclusion temporal</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Under Article 48, a
complex crime arises “when an offense is a necessary means for committing the
other." The term "necessary means" does </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">connote indispensable means for if it did
then the offense as a "necessary means" to </span>commit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">another would be an indispensable element of
the latter and would be an ingredient thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The phrase "necessary means" merely signifies that one crime
is committed to facilitate and insure the commission of the other (<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Revised Penal Code, <span class="GramE">Vol</span>.
I, 1987 ed., p. 624, citing Dissent, <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span>, J., <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> Hernandez, 99 Phil. 515).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the crime of </span>Serious <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Illegal Detention was such a “necessary
means” as it was selected </span>by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant
and his co-accused to facilitate and carry out more effectively their evil
design to stage a robbery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The facts of this case
differ from those in People vs. Astor, <span class="GramE">et</span> <span class="SpellE">als</span>. </span>(G. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">R.
Nos. L-71765-66, 29 April 1987, 149 SCRA 325) where the accused were convicted
of Robbery but acquitted in the case for Serious Illegal Detention and where it
was held that "the detention is absorbed in the crime of robbery."
For one, in </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">Astor</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">there
were two (2) separate <span class="SpellE">Informations</span> filed, one for
Robbery and another for Serious Illegal Detention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, <span class="GramE">only
one Information</span> was filed charging the complex offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For another, in <u>Astor</u>, the robbery had
already been consummated and the detention was merely to forestall the capture
of the robbers </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Not so in this case, where the detention was availed of as a means of
insuring the consummation of the robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further, in <u>Astor</u>, the detention was only incidental to the main
crime of robbery so that it was held therein:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
were appellants themselves not trapped by the early arrival of the police at
the scene of the crime, they would have not anymore detained the people inside
since they have already completed their job.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, appellants were left with no choice but to resort to
detention of these people as security, until arrangements for their safe
passage were made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not the crime
of illegal detention punishable under the penal laws but an act of restraint in
order to delay the pursuit of the criminals by peace officers (People v. Sol, 9
Phil. 265; People v. <span class="SpellE">Uday</span>, 85 Phil. 167, cited in the
Revised Penal Code, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Vol. 3, 1976 ed., p.
1337).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the victims in a robbery
case were detained in the course of robbery, the detention is absorbed by the
crime of robbery (P v. <span class="SpellE">Baysa</span>, 92 Phil. 1008, <span class="GramE">id</span>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, the detention was only incidental to the main crime of robbery, and
although in the course thereof women and children were also held, that threats
to kill were made, the act should not be considered as a separate offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellants should only be held guilty of
robbery."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In contrast, the
detention in the case at bar was not only incidental to the robbery but was a
necessary means to commit the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was handed to <span class="SpellE">Apellant</span>, the latter and his co-accused still refused to
leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victims were then taken as
hostages and the demand to produce an additional P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
was made as a prerequisite for their release.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The detention was not because the accused were trapped by the police nor
were the </span>victims held as security against the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The detention was not merely a matter of
restraint to enable the malefactors to escape, but deliberate as a means of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">extortion for an additional amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police and other authorities <span class="GramE">arrived</span> only much later after several hours of detention had
already passed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, despite appeals to
appellant and his co-accused to surrender, they adamantly refused until the
amount of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> they demanded could be turned
over to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They even considered P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the amount being handed to them, as inadequate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The foregoing features
also distinguish this case from those of U.S. v. Sol, 9 Phil. 265 (1907) where
the restraint </span>was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for no other
purpose than to prevent the victims from reporting the crime to the
authorities; from People v. <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>, 92 Phil. 1085

order to liquidate the witnesses to the robbery; from People v. <span class="SpellE">Baysa</span>, 92 Phil. 1008 (1953); People v. <span class="SpellE">Manzanilla</span>,
