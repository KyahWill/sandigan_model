				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i>certiorari</i> challenges the decision of
the National Labor Relations Commission reversing the decision of the Labor
Arbiter which directed petitioner's reinstatement in respondent company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, Rogelio Garcia, was employed in the Manila
Electric Company since <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1968</st1:date>,
starting as a lineman-trainee until he <span class="GramE">rose</span> to the
rank of <span class="SpellE">Leadman</span> Grade III, assigned to <span class="SpellE">MERALCO's</span> North Distribution Division in Valenzuela, Metro
Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His primary function was to
attend to customers' complaints regarding defective meters and metering
installations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1985</st1:date>,
at around <st1:time minute="45" hour="10">10:45 o'clock</st1:time> in the
morning, accompanied by a subordinate, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>,
he responded to a customer's complaint (docketed as Complaint No. <span class="GramE">CR </span><st1:date year="1805" day="11" month="1"><span class="GramE">1-11-1805</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">) of "power
failure" at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="GramE">No. 27 Santiago
  St.</span></st1:address></st1:street><span class="GramE">, <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>,
Metro Manila.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Garcia pulled
out the electric meter to inspect it, he discovered that one of the screws of
the potential link was missing, indicative of meter-tampering.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A customer found guilty of meter-tampering
would be penalized by a fine of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner informed complainant, Leticia
De <span class="GramE">Jesus, that</span> the meter would have to be
replaced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. De Jesus introduced
herself as the wife of Rodolfo De Jesus, the security supervisor of Eagle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Security Agency which guards <span class="SpellE">MERALCO's</span> <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She requested Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>
to make the replacement of her electric meter at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="15"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">3:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> in the afternoon of that day when her
husband would have arrived home from work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Garcia agreed to accommodate Mrs. De Jesus </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"considering </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that her husband is in a way a <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> man as he is the supervisor of the agency guarding
MERALCO" (p. 13, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, he called his home base to
report that De Jesus' electric meter would have to be replaced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> returned to the De
Jesus house at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon to replace the tampered meter bearing number 33
SUN-92772.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Garcia parked the pick-up
truck and instructed <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> to install the new meter
bearing number 33-SYN-46293, while he waited inside the truck to guard their
tools.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">new meter </span>had been installed, power was restored in the De Jesus
residence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>
informed Garcia that Mrs. De Jesus would like him to come inside her house as
she had other complaints.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> soon as he entered the house, a man
approached him and inserted some paper bills inside his hip pocket.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Three men suddenly appeared, grabbed him by
the arms, took the paper bills consisting of five P100 bills from his pants
pocket, and brought him to the office of the <span class="SpellE">MERALCO's</span>
Patrol Division on </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Ortigas</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Avenue</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> for investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The three men were later identified as Kim <span class="SpellE">Laroza</span>, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Diesta</span> and Eddie <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>, all from the MERALCO Security Inspection
Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The five P100 bills bearing
Serial Numbers KL 295608, GT 812431, JY 977041, LC 78585 and AM 787927, were
allegedly paid to Garcia in exchange for his not reporting the tampered </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">meter for laboratory examination or induce
him to conceal it from MERALCO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">An administrative
investigation of Garcia was conducted by <span class="SpellE">Venturado</span> <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> under the supervision of Atty. Pablo Martin of <span class="SpellE">MERALCO's</span> Legal Department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They recommended Garcia's dismissal from the service, pursuant to the
Code of Employee Discipline, particularly Section 7, paragraph 8 thereof, which
imposes the penalty of dismissal from employment "for dishonesty by
soliciting or receiving money, gift, share, percentage or benefits from any
person, personally or through the mediation of another, to perform an act
prejudicial to the company." <span class="GramE">(p. 15, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Rollo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">.)</span></span></span> On <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="7">July
 25, 1986</st1:date>, Garcia was dismissed with forfeiture of all benefits and
privileges.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">August
 26, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, he filed a
complaint for illegal dismissal in the Arbitration Branch of the Department of
Labor and Employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing
before the Labor Arbiter, Leticia De Jesus alleged in her Affidavit that when
Garcia informed her that meter tampering carried a big penalty, she instructed
her nephew, <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Herrera, to ask Garcia what they
could do about the meter defect and Garcia allegedly told her that for P500 he
could take care of the problem by not revealing his findings in his
investigation report to MERALCO; that she requested Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span> to return in the afternoon of the same day as she
would first inform her husband about the matter; that her husband was
infuriated to learn that a MERALCO crew was extorting money from his wife, so
he reported the matter to the Patrol Division which dispatched an entrapment
team to arrest Garcia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, in his
<span class="SpellE">Sinumpaang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span>, Garcia
alleged that he was framed to cover up his discovery of meter-tampering in De
Jesus' house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">May 18,
 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the Labor
Arbiter rendered a decision finding that Garcia was "framed" and,
declaring that his dismissal was illegal, MERALCO was ordered to reinstate him
to his former or equivalent position with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
without loss of seniority, plus attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the
judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">MERALCO appealed to the
National Labor Relations Commission which reversed the labor arbiter's decision
</span>and dismissed the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Garcia unsuccessfully filed a motion for reconsideration of the NLRC
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this
petition for <i>certiorari</i> alleging that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of
discretion in reversing the decision of the labor arbiter.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is merit </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">What is clear from a
consideration of all the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this
case, is that the screw of the potential link of the De Jesus' electric meter
was indeed missing, a sure sign </span>that it had been tampered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was established not only by the
petitioner himself but also by his workmate, <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was also admitted by Mrs. De Jesus who was
present when the electric meter was pulled out for inspection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the records show that petitioner
reported the defective meter to his home base, upon its discovery, to justify
its replacement with a new one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
in anticipation of <span class="SpellE">MERALCO's</span> possible adverse action
against him, the security <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">supervisor
turned the tables on the petitioner by arranging his entrapment for extortion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The decision of the NLRC
does not reveal sufficient evidence of dishonesty to justify the petitioner's
dismissal from the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having been
informed by Mrs. De Jesus herself that her husband was the security supervisor
in <span class="SpellE">MERALCO's</span> <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span>
office, it would have been suicide for the petitioner to attempt to blackmail
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged extortion attempt is
not credible considering that Garcia had in fact already reported the defective
meter to his home base in the morning and obtained a replacement for it in the
afternoon, before the entrapment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, Garcia's subordinate, <span class="SpellE">Tayag</span>, denied
the charge against Garcia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner's right to
security of tenure may not be jeopardized except by clear and convincing
evidence of dishonesty, which the private respondent failed to produce.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A doubtful accusation should not be allowed
to overshadow petitioner's unblemished record of service for eighteen (18)
years, and the promotions he had received in the course of his employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the assailed decision of the NLRC is
