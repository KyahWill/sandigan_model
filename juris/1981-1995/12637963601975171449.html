discrimination against her in relation to other employees of the Corporation
who had been in the past similarly charged with alleged infractions of the

petitioner asserts discrimination against herself consisting of the failure of
the respondent Corporation to dismiss the two (2) immediate supervisors of the
investment counselor who had carried out the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In respect of Item 1,
preventive suspension does not in itself prove that the company had prejudged
that petitioner was guilty of the charges she was asked to answer and
explain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Preventive suspension may be
necessary for the protection of the company, its operations and assets, pending
investigation of the alleged malfeasance or misfeasance on the part of officers
or employees of the company and pending a decision on the part of the company
(See Sec. 3 of Rule XIV, Book V, of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor
Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the very senior</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>and sensitive character of

Department,</span> a line <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">position as </span>distinguished
from a staff or planning position, and considering the unauthorized
transactions, then just discovered by the respondent Corporation, we do not
believe that the preventive suspension was an arbitrary and capricious act
amounting to bad faith on the part of the respondent Corporation.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In respect of Item 2, the
alleged personal motive behind petitioner's dismissal -- personal envy or
feelings of personal insecurity on the part of <span class="SpellE">Guil</span>
Rivera; Senior Vice-President, respondent NLRC found that petitioner had not
sufficiently established her assertion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's assertion on this point appears no more than a conjecture
or supposition and does not afford an adequate basis for overturning respondent
<span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> finding on this point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, if petitioner had clearly proven
such personal ill-will on the part of Mr. Rivera, a serious question would
arise as to whether the respondent Corporation (as distinguished from Mr.
Rivera) could be held liable</span> at all for Mr. Rivera's acts in the absence
of clear authorization for, or approval or adoption of, such act by the
respondent Corporation <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">with

<p class="BODY">In respect of Item 3, respondent <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
decision was silent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court believes,
however, that <span class="GramE">respondent</span> Corporation must be accorded
reasonable latitude in determining who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">among
erring officers or employees should be punished by the company and to what
extent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, <span class="GramE">respondent</span> Corporation presumably found it was not necessary
to terminate the services also of the two (2) section heads in petitioner's
department, who clearly are much lower in the corporate hierarchy than
petitioner.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">With respect to the last
and most important of the above listed items, the scope of petitioner's responsibility
for the operations of her department and the extent of her supervisory
authority over her subordinates in the marketing department, respondent NLRC
set forth the following discussion and evaluation:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Appellants stressed the point <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">that </span>complainant, as vice president, marketing, is actually <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>department head of one of the
company's sales department (sic).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
such, her basic function is the supervision and monitoring the daily activities
of her department and the employees she supervises (sic). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>By the nature of the company's business,
complainant as a department head should see to it that the clients' trust and
confidence in the company is upheld through above-board transactions, untainted
relations, satisfactory servicing and unquestioned integrity of its officers
and staff, aside from the promotion of cordial employee relations among her
personnel through unbiased and uniform implementation of company policies
affecting employee benefits and welfare.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to the appellants, the finding of the Labor Arbiter that
'complainant is not expected to keep an eye or be aware of all day-to-day
transactions of her workers particularly Investment Consultants in her
department' does not conform to the facts prevailing in this case.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor</span> case, which is the
crucial point at issue, <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor</span> opened an account
with the respondent corporation on <st1:date year="1984" day="28" month="6">June
 28, 1984</st1:date> by depositing the amount of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
through Sofia <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>, investment <span class="SpellE">counsellor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead
of the client signing the Customers Agreement, it was <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>
who signed the agreement and the signature card in the name of the client,
which is highly irregular.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Had she
exercised prudence in the supervision of her investment consultants, the
irregularity could have been earlier detected</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>result, the sum of P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor's</span> account was transferred by <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>account
of Ramon Lopez, without the knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor</span>
on <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="7">July
 13, 1984</st1:date>, the said client withdrew the sum of P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
through a Payment Instruction Form that was approved by the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="8">August
 6, 1984</st1:date>, the amount of P4<span class="GramE">,052.59</span> was
transferred by <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span> to the account of <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor</span> from the account of Ramon Lopez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This transaction was with the approval of the
complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1984</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor</span>
demanded the payment of the balance of P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from
the respondent company to close his account and the letter of <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor</span> was referred to complainant by respondent <span class="SpellE">Guil</span> Rivera for necessary action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her memorandum to senior vice president <span class="SpellE">Guil</span> Rivera, <u>complainant confirmed the irregularity in
the handling of the account of <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor</span>, but she
failed to take appropriate action against the erring employee which was within
her power to discipline employees under her supervision</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later on February 4, 1985, a complaint was
filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission by <span class="SpellE">Panemanglor</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">for </span>the recovery of the
P25,000.00 plus damages against the respondent corporation, contrary to her
claim that the client will not file a recovery suit against the corporation
since the obligation was purely personal to <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondents contend that complainant could have immediately
discovered the unauthorized signature of Sofia <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>
that led to the illegal transfers of fund, had she followed the company
procedure and practice for her to be personally acquainted with new clients and
her admission that she was not aware of the complained acts has brought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>light that she was remiss in her
supervisory and monitoring function.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
top of this, she failed to institute disciplinary action against the erring
employee.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner's argument
that, because she was head of the entire marketing (sales) department, she could
not be expected to monitor the detailed or day-to-day acts and <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of the staff members of her department, does not
address what appears to be the thrust of the respondent <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And that is, that as head of
the department, it was her responsibility to adopt ways and means of keeping
herself sufficiently informed of the activities of her staff members so </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">to prevent or at least discover at an early stage, e.g., unauthorized
or illegal transactions and manipulation of clients' accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the one hand, the above position taken by
the respondent NLRC cannot be regarded as so obviously unreasonable and
despotic </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to constitute a grave abuse of discretion,
given the character of the business <span class="GramE">of a commodities</span>
trading company and the fact that very substantial sums of money are handled
daily by petitioner's department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
the other hand, petitioner's logic would </span>lead to the conclusion that the
more senior the management position, the slighter the responsibility for
malfeasance or nonfeasance that can be laid upon the position-holder; the chief
executive officer of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>corporation
would effectively have, under this logic, little or no responsibility at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning to the specific award made by respondent NLRC, the salary
base properly used in computing the separation pay and the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
due to petitioner should include not just the basic salary but also the regular
allowances that petitioner had been receiving (See <u>Santos v. National Labor
Relations Commission</u>, G.R. No. 76721, 21 September 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In petitioner's case, the base figure
properly includes her:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(a) </span>basic salary of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> a month; and (b) living allowance of P2,400 a month

by petitioner ("override commission" plus "net deposit
incentive") are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">not </span>properly
includible in such base figure since such commissions must be earned by actual
