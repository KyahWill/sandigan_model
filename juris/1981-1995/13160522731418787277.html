				<H3>DELIA VALLE VDA. DE ORTIZ, NECITAS ORTIZ, FREDDIE PANGANIBAN, NANCY ORTIZ-MEJIA, AND LINO MEJIA, PETITIONERS, VS. LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES AND HON. AMADOR T. VALLEJOS, AS PRESIDING JUDGE, CFI MANILA, BRANCH XXII, RESPONDENTS.</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>GANCAYCO, J.</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, Branch XXII in Civil Case No. 99893, dismissing the 
complaint filed by Ildefonso Ortiz, now substituted by his heirs, herein 
petitioners, against respondent Land Bank of the Philippines.</p>
<p align="justify">Ildefonso Ortiz was the owner of some parcel of land located in 
Camarines Sur which where affected by Presidential Decree No. 27 entitled 
"Decreeing the Emancipation of Tenants from the Bondage of Soil Transferring To 
Them the Ownership of the Land They Till and Providing the Instrument and 
Mechanism Therefor. "Under this law, which was promulgated on October 21, 1972, 
the cost of the land shall be paid by the tenant- farmer directly to the 
landowner in kind or in cash depending on their agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">On July 21, 1973, Presidential Decree no. 251 was promulgated 
which providedm among others, that it will be the Land Bank which would pay the 
landowners and the tenants shall in turn, pay the Land Bank the cost the 
property covered.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The modes of payment 
under any of which the Land Bank shall finance the aquisition of the farm lots 
were enumerated as follows:</p>
<div align="justify">
<ol><li>Cash payment of 10% and balance in 25-years tax-free 6% Land Bank 
bonds;<br><br></li><li>Payment of 30% in preferred shares of stock issued by the Bank and balance 
in 25-year tax-free 6% Land Bank bonds;<br><br></li><li>Full guarantee on the payment of the fifteen (15) equal annual amortization 
to be made by the tenant/farmer.<br><br></li><li>Payment through the establishment of annuities or persons with 
insurance;<br><br></li><li>Exchange arrangement of government stocks in government-owned or controlled 
corporations or private corporations where the government has 
holdings;<br><br></li><li>Such other modes of settlement as may be further adopted by the Board of 
Directors and approved by the President of the Philippines."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></li></ol></div>
<p align="justify">Ortiz elected to be paid under the first mode of settlement and 
the respondent on April 1, 1974, upon approval of his claim, paid him the total 
sum of P1,564,359.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> in cash and 
interest-bearing bonds for his landholdings. To arrive at the total acquisition 
price of said property, the respondent band used the computation provided for 
Presidential Decree No. 27 and deducted the sum of P11,141.00 — the amount of 
rentals paid to Ortiz by the tenants from October 21, 1972. Said computation is 
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"For the purpose of determining the cost of the land to be 
transferred to the tenant-farmer pursuant to this Decree, the value of the land 
shall be equivalent to two and one-half to two and one-half (2½) times the 
average harvest of three normal crop years immediately preceding the 
promulgation of this Decree."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">After recieving the price for his landholdings, Ortiz executed 
deeds of assignment of rights<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> in favor 
of the Land Bank whereby he formally assigned, transferred and conveyed to the 
Land Bank all his claims, rights, interests and participation over his 
landholdings. However, on October 24, 1975, Ortiz filed a complaint with the 
Court of First Instance of Manila against the respondent Land Bank alleging that 
he is entitled to receive interests at the rate of 6% per annum from and 
effective October 21, 1972.</p>
<p align="justify">On November 23, 1976, the lowe court rendered a decision 
dismissing the complaint. Hence this petition.</p>
<p align="justify">The only issue at bar is simply whether or not under the law, 
the respondent Land Bank is obliged to pay 6% interest on the acquisition price 
of Ortiz's lands for the period between October 21, 1972 the date of 
promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 27 and April 1, 1974, when the Land Bank 
paid him said acquisition price.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners contend that under Presidential Decree Nos. 27, 85 
and 251, the cost of land transferred to the tenant-farmer that respondent Land 
Bank has to pay includes interest at the rate of 6% per annum accuring from the 
promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 27. In support of this posture, 
petitioners cite the following provisions of law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Par. 9, Presidential Decree No. 27 —</p>
<p align="justify">"The total cost of the land, including interest at the rate of 
six (6) percentum, shall be paid by the tenant in fifteen (15) equal annual 
amortizations";</p>
<p align="justify">Section 2, Par. 1(d) of Presidential Decree No. 251 —</p>
<p align="justify">"7. To finance and/or guarantee the acquisition, under 
Presidential Decree No. 85 dated December 25, 1972, of farm lots transferred to 
tenant-farmers pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27 dated October 21, 
1972."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The provisions of Presidential Decree No. 27 and Presidential 
Decree No. 85 cited by petitioners deal with the relationship between the 
tenant-farmer and the landowner alone. Paragraph 9 of Presidential Decree No. 27 
only referes to the manner of payment set to be followed by the tenant-farmer in 
paying for the total cost of the land transferred to him, that is, in 15 years 
of 15 equal annual amortizations. Sec. 2, paragraph 19d) of Presidential Decree 
No. 85, on other hand, fully fuarantees such payment by the tenant-farmer. 
Nowhere in Presidential Decree No. 27 was the Land Bank ever mentioned. Neither 
is there any indication in both Presidential Decree No, 27 and 85 that payment 
of interest should begin on October 21, 1972. Accordingly, We hold that the 
assertion that under these laws, the respondent Land Bank is obliged to pay for 
a 6% interest beginning the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 27. is 
deviod of merit.</p>
<p align="justify">It is clear that Presidential Decree No. 27. is the law 
applicable to this case as it is this law which gives the Land Bank the power to 
finance and/or guarantly the acquisition of farm lots transferred to 
tenant-farmers pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 27.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Section 7 which deals, among others, with 
the modes of payment under which the Land Bank shall finance the acquisition of 
farm lots is the more specific provision of the said law, pertinent to this 
case.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioner's ascendant Ortiz admitted in his complaint that he 
close to be paid under the first mode of settlement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> by which he would receive 10 % in cash and 
the balance in Land Bank bonds, and nothing more. Such bonds would be earning 6% 
interest per year maturing in 25 years. Respondent Land Bank paid him in 
accordance with the law and in conformity with what he freely chose among the 
modes of payment enumerated.</p>
<p align="justify">Petitioners do not question the cash payment nor the issuance 
of the bonds. But then, they insist on their right to receive interests due from 
October 21, 1972. Yet the law is very clear — there is not even a hint of the 
alleged obligation of the Land Bank to pay such interests.</p>
<p align="justify">The mere fact that respondent Land Bank admits, as is shown in 
the deeds of assignment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> that it will 
be subrogated to the right of the landowner to collect and receive yearly 
amortizations from the tenant-farmer does not at all mean that respondent Land 
Bank should pay the aforementioned interests. Such subrogatio is clearly 
provided for in Presidential Decree No. 251, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Whenever the Bank pays the whole or a portion fo the total 
cost of farm lots, the Bank shall be subrogated by reason thereof, to the right 
of the landowner to collect and receive the yearly amortizations on farms lots 
or the amount paid including interest thereon, from tenant farmers in whose 
favor said farm lots had been transferred pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 
27, dated October 21, 1972."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Nor can the above-mentioned provision be construced to imply 
that respondent Land Bank should pay interests beginning October 21, 1972. One 
of the established rules of saturtory construction is that Courts may not make 
an implication which the language of the stature may not warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Also, it has been repeatedly declared 
that where the land speaks in clear and categorical language, there is no room 
for intepretation or construction, there is only room for application.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In the particular law under 
consideration, no ambiguity can be found.</p>
<p align="justify">Furthermore, there is absolutely nothing wrond with the 
respondent Land Bank's deduction from the total payment on the landholdings of 
the amount of P11,141.00 conrresponding to the rentals paid by the tenants to 
Ortiz since October 21, 1972. This was done in compliance with Department 
Memorandum Circular No. 8 issued by the Department of Agrarian Regorm in 
1974.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></p>
<p align="justify">Finally, this Court took note of the fact that petitioner's 
predecessor, Ortiz executed the following affidavits in which he stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"That I/we hereby agree that the bond certificates which from 
part of the proceeds of my landholdings shall begin to earn interest only on the 
date of approval of my/our claim for payment and not earlier;</p>
<p align="justify">'That I/we hereby further warrant and guarantee that all 
payments/proceeeds received by me/us from the Land Bank as 
settlement/compensation under Land Transfer Claim No. 74-018A and 74-018-R shall 
absolute and render the Land Bank forever free of liability for any pending 
and/pr new claims and liens on the land transferred under P.D. No. 27, and that 
I/we shall well and truly defend the Land Bank at my/our own cost and expenses 
against any and all claims of third person(s) asserting themselves to be the 
rightgul claimant of the payment/proceeds received by me/us from the Land Bank, 
and shall well and truly pay in full any and claims or assertions of said nature 
which may be established as valid and well-founded by the final judgment of any 
court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p align="justify">'That I/we shall abide with all existing policy, rules and 
regulations of the Land Bank and with those that may be issued in the future 
affecting my/our bondholdings.' (Italics types supplied)</p>
<p align="justify">(Affidavits executed on October 3, 1975 and October 22, 
1975)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p></blockquote>
