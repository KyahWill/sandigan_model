<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are sufficiently summarized in the Brief
for the People as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At around 8:00 o'clock in the evening of 15 October 1986,
private complainant Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> went out of her
house in San Isidro, <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>,
to collect payment for the '<span class="SpellE">tocino</span>' which she had
sold on credit to a certain Cora <span class="SpellE">Haluot</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="8">6 August 1987</st1:date>, pp. 8-9; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="8">27 August
 1987</st1:date>, pp. 6, 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
encountered her friend of around 10 years, the other private complainant, <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> Hernandez, in the canteen of her house, and since
it was payday they invited each other to supper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="8">27 August 1987</st1:date>, pp. 16-17).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After eating supper in an eatery near the
municipal building, they proceeded to the house of Cora <span class="SpellE">Haluot</span>
at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>id.</u>, p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cora <span class="SpellE">Haluot</span> was not
around, so private complainant Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> invited
the other private complainant <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> Hernandez, to
enjoy the breeze at the old pier along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="8">6 August 1987</st1:date>, pp. 7-8; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="8">27 August

off with sea water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>id.</u>, pp.
8-9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she was about to wash her
pants, accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and another accused, a certain <span class="SpellE">Mando</span>, approached them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>(id.</u>, p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes informed the couple that they (the two accused)
were <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">tanods</span>, and
that strolling around the pier was prohibited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<u>id.</u>, p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private
complainant Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> retorted that how could it
be so when the pier was a public place, while private complainant <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> Hernandez apologized, saying that he was not aware
of any such prohibition, and that they were not '<span class="SpellE">katalo</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>id</u>., p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon thereafter, the two accused walked some
5 meters away from the two private complainants, during which period of time
Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> hurriedly put on her soiled
pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was about to button the same,
when the accused returned and collared them (the private complainants).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>id.</u>; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="10">1 October 1987</st1:date>, p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mando</span> pointed a gun
at private complainant <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> Hernandez while
accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes pulled the hair, and pointed a dagger at the left side of the neck, of
private complainant Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>, at the same time
pulling the latter to the cemented portion of the old pier some 12 meters away
from the other two.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

<blockquote>Upon reaching the cemented portion of the pier, accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes ordered, with
the dagger still pointed at the left side of the neck of private complainant
Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>, the latter to lie down and to remove
her pants and panty, to which the latter, being so frightened, complied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="8">6 August 1987</st1:date>, pp. 11-12; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="9">10 September
 1987</st1:date>, p. 24).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After removing
his pants, the accused-appellant, then, placed himself on top of private
complainant Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>, who was crying
helplessly, and '[h]is organ went in and out of [private complainant Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan's</span>] organ' for about 15 minutes; after which,
accused-appellant ordered said private complainant, to put on her panty and
pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="8">6 August 1987</st1:date>, pp. 12-13; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="9">10 September

<span class="SpellE">Mando</span> asked private complainant Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> if she has a residence certificate, to which the
latter replied in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>id</u>.)
Frisking Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> from her breasts to her
private parts, accused <span class="SpellE">Mando</span> removed, upon
instruction of the accused-appellant, private complainant's P500.00 from her
wallet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>id.</u>, pp. 13-14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, accused <span class="SpellE">Mando</span>,
likewise upon instruction of the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Bayani</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, took Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan's</span>

pleaded with the two accused to take pity on them and said that they will just
forget the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>id</u>.) The
accused-appellant was willing to allow private complainant Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span> to go home (in fact, he wanted her to go home
naked) so long as the other private complainant, <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span>
Hernandez, would stay behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(<u>id.</u>, </span>pp. 15-16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pleading with the two accused, the two

two visitors, told them that <span style="">she </span>had

<span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> Hernandez, as both of them live near their
place (TSN, February 17, 1988, p. 5).</blockquote>

uses to earn a living, accused-appellant felt insulted and thus berated the
couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The couple apologized, but
accused-appellant could not be restrained.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To teach the couple a lesson, he took their clothes and brought it home
with him.</blockquote>

clothes under his bed and immediately left again to report the incident to a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> councilman.<span style="">&nbsp;

proceeded to the house of a policeman residing in their <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>,
who in turn told him that he (the policeman) would take care of
everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When accused-appellant
returned to his home, he found out that his wife, taking pity on the couple,
returned back the confiscated clothes (TSN, January 28, 1988, p. 26).</blockquote>

prosecution's version of the incident which is consistent with the </span>material
and physical facts of the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To begin with, complainants <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> and
Emily have positively identified the accused as one of the two malefactors who
staged the robbery-rape in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This identification is even more reinforced by the confirmation of the
accused placing himself at the scene of the crime during its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sequence of events would reveal that said
complainants have had ample opportunity of having a good look at the accused.
Firstly, when they were initially accosted by said accused during which a short
conversation transpired between them; secondly, when the accused upon
departing, momentarily returned and again accosted them and it was at this
juncture that the rape on Emily was committed; and, thirdly, when finally the
accused divested them of their personal effects. More particularly, since Emily
was the victim of the assault herself, she thus came face to face with her
abuser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is another clinching factor
that enabled her to recollect, if not retain a clear memory of the face of said
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It is the natural reaction of
every victim of criminal violence to strive to know the identity of the
assailant' (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Orteza</span>, 6 SCRA 109 (1962);
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Catipon</span>, G.R. Nos. L-49264-66, <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="10">Oct. <span style="">9, </span>1985</st1:date>).
What further made recognition much easier is the illumination coming from the
public hospital some 14 meters away which gave Emily a clearer view of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> facial features.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the accused made no effort to cover his face or resort to any
disguise when perpetrating the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
held by the Supreme Court: <span style="">&nbsp;</span>'Where clear
and positive identification is made by the People’s witnesses regarding the
participation of the accused in the crime against him, his denial and
explanation cannot overcome such evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">(People vs. Chavez, et al., 81
OG No. 16. p. 1612).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>There is nothing in the records that would show that complainant
Emily had any bias or prejudice against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her court testimony was given in a direct,
coherent and forthright manner and devoid of any suspicious circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds no marked inconsistencies in
her court declaration as contrasted to and which substantially dovetails with
what she narrated in her sworn statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"A") executed by her the day following the tragic incident before the
police investigator spontaneously at a time when the facts relating thereto
were still fresh in her mind and when extraneous influence was not yet exerted
upon her and her only motive was to tell the truth in the interest of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the mind of the Court, the
fact that she lost no time in denouncing the wrong done to her to the police
and revealing the details of the incident in question at the same time
specifically describing the accused as a bearded man, and whose nickname is '<span class="SpellE">Anie</span>' which easily led to the recovery by the police of part
of the stolen articles and the prompt arrest of the accused, bespeak of
spontaneity, candidness and reliability on her part.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The testimony of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Graciano</span></span><span style="">, the
other complainant, equally positive, </span>categorical and unequivocal,
complements and affirms that of Emily's to the effect that the accused was
Emily's rapist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His recognition of the
culprits is positive and absolute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to him, he was present at the scene of the crime as he was
then with Emily so that he actually witnessed at close range the commission of
the dastardly crime, being then held at bay with a gun pointed at him by the
accused, <span class="SpellE">Mando</span> Doe, while the accused <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes was ravishing Emily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His narration of the events of which he has a
direct and immediate knowledge strikes the Court as positive, credible and
probable and would suffice to mark said accused as the one who raped Emily and
victimized them of their personal belongings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is true that <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> was himself a
victim with respect to the <span class="SpellE">robbbery</span> aspect of the
incident and an intimate friend of Emily and, therefore, may have in his heart
a desire to avenge the wrongdoing committed on his person and that of
Emily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But while revenge is a normal
reaction in a person who was aggrieved by the felonious act of another, it does
not follow that <span style="">vindictiveness </span>should
be directed aimlessly so as to include even innocent persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Cf. People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>,
et al., GR No. L-27422, <st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="1">Jan. 30, 1984</st1:date>,
83 OG No. 47, p. 6068).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does
such closeness of relationship necessarily taint <span class="SpellE">Graciano's</span>
testimony nor detract <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the probative credit
that should otherwise be accorded to it; nor does the same prove prejudice or
bias (Cf. People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span>, 106 SCRA 383); it may
indicate at most the need for some caution in its assessment but it should not
be deemed as impairing testimonial credit (People vs. Cruz, 133 SCRA 426;
People vs. Bautista, 147 SCRA 500), specially where, as here, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> finds ample corroboration as regards material
details not only from the declarations of Emily and other prosecution witnesses
but also from the testimony of the accused himself who, as earlier adverted to,
admitted his presence at the crime scene although with a different version of
the incident (Cf. People vs. Gutierrez, Jr., GR No. 3983, March 14, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>At any rate, as between the positive and categorical declarations
of the two principal prosecution witnesses, Emily and <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span>,
and the mere denial constituting self-serving negative assertions of the
accused and his sole witness, his wife Imelda, that no such unusual incident
involving the accused occurred on that night in question, the choice is not
hard to make, for the jurisprudence on the matter is that positive statement is
stronger and attains greater evidentiary weight than negative evidence (People
vs. Gonzales, 76 Phil. 473; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bocasas</span>, 137
SCRA 531; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Paseo</span>, Jr., 137 SCRA 137).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Confirmation of Emily's account of her defloration also came from
Dr. Willie <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>, the Rural Health Physician who,
after examining her physically and genitally barely 12 hours after the
incident, found the presence of fresh injuries such as abrasions (or scratches
or bluish spots) and contusions on her body.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notably, the contusions and abrasions at the skin surface surrounding
the vagina were, as explained by the examining physician, caused by the force
applied on the victim resulting in trauma and hyperemia (blood congestion) due
to the forceful penetration of a hard object, like a penis, into the vaginal
wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This physical evidence which is of
the highest order, stamps<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emily's
testimony of how she was forcibly ravished by the accused with the impress of
solid truth, and gives the lie to the latter's protestations of innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that complainant is no longer a
virgin as of the date of (sic) incident is of no material consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Virginity is not an essential element in
rape and the character of the offended party in rape committed by force is
immaterial.' (People vs. Ramos, GR No. L-49281, <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="8">Aug. 27, 1987</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Equally complementing
complainants' story is the testimony of P/Cpl. Isidro Ruiz, the police
investigator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a direct and coherent
manner, he declared that upon learning from an informant that complainants'
stolen articles were in the possession of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
wife, Imelda, he immediately contacted the latter who, therewith, voluntarily
surrendered to him the subject items consisting of two wrist watches and a gold
ring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added that when he asked Imelda
where she got said jewelries, she replied that her husband entrusted them to
her for safekeeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recovery of the
stolen items the day after the incident apparently cracked the case for the
police for then it led to the early fall of the accused in their hands that
same day and to his having to account for his misdeeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doubtless, these proven physical facts would
suffice to connect, if not incriminate the accused to the </span>robbery-rape
in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuredly, there can be no
clearer proof of <span class="SpellE">asportation</span> by said accused of the
personal effects of complainants than that of their recovery from the
possession of his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally,
the testimony of Corporal Ruiz anent the fact of recovery was neither rebutted
nor belied by the accused which thereby renders it well-nigh conclusive against
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the court has no reason
to disbelieve the testimony of this police officer who, as such, has the duty
and moral obligation, in the interest of <span class="SpellE">fairplay</span> and
as an act of simple justice, to defend the truth as he is oath bound to
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'There is nothing on record to suggest
that he was moved by any motive other than simply the carrying out of his
official mission or duties' (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Patag</span>, 144
SCRA 429 (1986).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the accused
was even candid enough to admit that he has (sic) no quarrel or
misunderstanding with Corporal Ruiz prior to the incident in question (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 27, Feb. 17, 1988) and does not know why he
would so testify that way (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 26).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle of law that a person in
possession or control of the stolen goods is presumed to be the author of the
larceny well applies to the accused even if they were recovered from his wife
specially since he miserably failed to discharge the burden of accounting for
and justifying his possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would be naive for the Court, indeed, if it fails to conclude from
this proven fact the culpable participation of the accused in the crime in
question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The motivation which the accused seemingly ascribes to complainants
-- which is revenge for having upbraided them after he had surprised them in
the act of lustful coupling on board his <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, is
too crude and shallow and obviously a desperate, albeit vain attempt at seeking
exculpation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court's appreciation of
human values rejects the purported motive as fanciful and illogical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, since it was allegedly
complainants' despicable sexual conduct that has infuriated the accused there
was, therefore, no sound reason for them to stir up any kind <span style="">of </span>vengeful retaliation, i.e., by
falsely incriminating the accused of a very grave crime carrying capital
punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, secondly, complainants'
natural instinct would have been to just remain silent or to hide such immoral
assignation on their part which, if divulged, would certainly put them to great
shame and scandal, if not make of themselves the object of gossip in their
community.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, when they opted to face
cruel realities by exposing with immediacy the sexual assault and robbery
committed by the accused, it was because to them the crime, grave as it <span style="">is, </span>was too much to bear and keep to
themselves and should not remain unpunished.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, it is hardly believable and so unnatural that <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> and Emily would be so bereft of inhibition or any
sense of modesty as to commit sexual congress on board a <span class="SpellE">banca</span>
moored along the sea shore at the old pier.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of decency, they could have at least mutually agreed to a
more secret trysting place than in such venue -- an open space with anyone
expected to just appear from nowhere and thus reveal their promiscuity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the same vein, the claim of the accused and his wife, Imelda,
that Emily and <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> were then completely naked
when they surprised them in the act of sexual indulgence, equally defies the
rational limits, <span style="">if </span>not realties
of human behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For sure, not even
those of wanton disposition would strip themselves of all their <span class="SpellE">clothings</span>, including such personal effects as wrist watches
and ring when gratifying their libidinous urge more so in a public place and <span style="">with a time constraint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What they have to simply do if they were so
lustfully disposed was just to lower their underwear and be done over with in </span><span style="">such </span><span style="">short moment as possible without necessarily undressing themselves
completely.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Of note also <span style="">is </span>that
the accused made no imputation of any sort that Emily is a woman of loose morals
or ill-repute with the habit of satisfying her sexual urge even in a public
place which, as in this case, is a few meters distant from a busy street and a
public hospital and frequented by night strollers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Evidence to be worthy of credit, must not only proceed from a
reliable source, but it must in addition, be credible in itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, it must be natural,
reasonable and probable as to make it easy to believe (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, Jr., GR No. L-72354, <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1987</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, it has long been held that no young Filipina of decent
repute would publicly admit that she has been criminally abused and ravished
unless that <span style="">is </span>the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is her natural instinct to protect her
honor (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>, GR No. L-52230, <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="12">Dec. 15, 1986</st1:date>, 146 SCRA 256 and
cases cited therein).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein, it is
rather inconceivable that a simple and unsophisticated provincial woman like
Emily who was still possessed of the traditional and proverbial modesty of a
Filipina, would be that callous as to deliberately fabricate a tale of an
assault on her chastity and to suffer torment, <span style="">if </span>not ignominy of having to testify in a court of justice about
a grievous wrong done to her by the accused if in truth she was not really
raped and her only motive was revenge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records of the case do not indicate that she had any motive other
than an honest desire of obtaining justice and redress for the bestial act
committed on her (Cf. People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, 109 SCRA
176; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cayado</span>, et al., GR No. L-47398, <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1988</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>As sequel, if Emily was merely fabricating her story of robbery
with rape, she would easily be snarled and caught in the web of her own
prevarications during the laborious grind of a public trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, she should feel deterred by the
grave consequences of such willful falsehood which could easily be unmasked as
such by the medical findings that would be made after a thorough examination of
her body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the truth of her story
that gave her the courage and boldness fearlessly to face interrogation by the
police authorities and medical examination, both effective means to verify the
truth of her serious accusation (Cf. People vs. <span class="SpellE">Clarin</span>,
GR No. L-47200, <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="10">Oct. 30, 1981</st1:date>,
78 OG No. 52, p. 7276).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the Court is
convinced that Emily's testimony was given with sincerity and candor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It leaves no room for the slightest doubt
that it is not a mere concoction so that it has no hesitation to accept the
same as the more credible version as against that of the mere denial of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the location where
complainant was sexually assaulted, i.e., atop a concrete portion at (sic) old
pier, is a place where people usually pass by and stroll and located about a
few meters distant from the road and a public hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this does not render the commission of
the crime improbable, the Court being charged with notice of the fact that rape
has been committed even in vicinities or places where people usually gather or
pass by, such as in parks and by a roadside (People vs. Vidal, 127 SCRA 168
(1984); People vs. <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>, 127 SCRA 192 (1984) and
People vs. Lopez, 141 SCRA 386 (1986)."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, assisted by the then Citizens Legal Assistance Office

ACCUSED-APPELLANT'S GUILT AND TO OVERCOME THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESUMPTION OF
INNOCENCE IN HIS FAVOR."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">in support of which he contends that: (1)
it is highly improbable that the offense would be committed under the
circumstances the offended party, Emily <span class="SpellE">Punzalan</span>,
testified to; (2) the testimony of Emily is replete with and beset by serious
inconsistencies which render the same unworthy of belief; (3) the injuries
suffered by Emily were not proven by the prosecution to be the result of rape;
(4) certain material facts were not appreciated by the trial court; and (5)
there was no intent of gain on his part.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the first, appellant claims that the crime was allegedly
committed along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, which is a busy street even at
nighttime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are at least fifty (50)
houses along said street, the nearest being only about thirty (30) meters away
from the place where the crime was allegedly committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the site of the alleged crime is
only about fourteen (14) meters away from a public hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emily also testified that there were three
(3) persons and a couple who were about thirty (30) meters from the crime
scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is indeed true that she
shouted and cried at the time she was allegedly being abused by the Appellant,
then it would have certainly attracted the attention of the people nearby.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second contention, Appellant points out several alleged
contradictions and inconsistencies in Emily's testimony. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Thus, while she testified during the direct
examination that it was the Appellant himself who removed her pair of pants and
panty, she completely changed her answer on cross-examination when she claimed
that it was she who removed the pair of pants and panty upon order of the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span style="">she </span>averred that she had never met the
appellant before the incident and that it was only Cpl. Isidro Y. Ruiz who
identified the perpetrator from the description she gave; yet, Cpl. Isidro Y.
Ruiz testified that appellant was identified by the private complainant
herself, even giving his first name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lastly, she attested to the fact that aside from her hair being pulled
by the appellant, no other physical violence was committed before and during
the rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, her companion, <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> Hernandez, claimed that he saw the appellant
"box" Emily's thighs before she was raped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant avers that these inconsistencies in
the account of the incident cannot but create doubt as to their truthfulness
and sincerity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant likewise challenges the decision of the court <i><u>a</u>
<u>quo</u></i> on the basis of the negative finding of spermatozoa within the
victim's sexual organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
admitting that the absence of spermatozoa does not negate rape, its absence
when the private complainant was examined the day after the alleged incident
strengthened his claim that he caught the couple making love, and belied
Emily's allegation that the Appellant raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Appellant's unexpected arrival prevented
the couple, specifically the man, from reaching the climax of their sexual act,
thereby accounting for the absence of spermatozoa.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the robbery aspect of the <span style="">case, </span>appellant submits that there was no intent to gain as it is
an undisputed fact that the alleged stolen items were returned to the proper
authority the next day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Brief for the People, the Solicitor General nixes all the
contentions of Appellant and prays that the decision appealed from be affirmed <i><u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class="BODY">We now address the points raised in the Appellant's Brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first point raised by appellant is drawn from conclusions
which are not supported by facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is no evidence on record as to the length of <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Street, along which lies the pier, the place of the incident, and as to the
distance between or among, or the density of, the houses <span style="">lining </span>said street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house nearest the scene of the crime,
which was not even shown by the records to be inhabited, was thirty (30) meters
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the incident occurred
between 8:30 o'clock and 10:00 o'clock in the evening with the perpetrators
using a gun and a dagger to ensure the silence and cooperation of the
victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the presence of people
other than the appellant and his <span style="">co-</span>accused,
it was clearly established from the testimony of Emily that they had already
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on her cross-examination,

strong as when you find something like sperm inside the vagina and this, if the
patient is a virgin it could appear as lacerations, this could be stronger than
<span class="SpellE">caruncles</span>, however, I said it could be because there
are contusions around the vaginal area and vaginal discharge which could also

<p class="BODY">The last point raised by the appellant, which has reference to
the charge of robbery, is the absence of intent to gain in the taking of the

the victims (Emily and <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span>) <span style="">a lesson </span>and the subsequent return of
the goods the day following the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are then of the
opinion that the evidence </span>for <span style="">the
prosecution in this case has established beyond all reasonable doubt that appellant
committed the crimes of rape and, with his co-accused, the crime of robbery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In rape cases, the
following guidelines and principles are well-entrenched:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An accusation for rape can be made with
facility:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it is difficult to prove but
more difficult for the person accused, though innocent, to disprove it;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In view of the <span style="">intrinsic </span>nature of the crime of rape where two persons are
usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with
extreme caution;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence for the prosecution must stand
or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the
weakness of the evidence for the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the lower court judiciously applied these
guidelines in holding appellant liable for the rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, both complainants were able to
positively identify the accused as one of the two (2) malefactors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More particularly, since Emily was the victim
of the assault herself, she naturally came face to face with the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have held that it is the natural reaction
of every victim of criminal violence to strive to know the identify of the
assailant.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
And, when a woman says that she has been raped, she says, in effect, all that
is necessary to show that rape <span style="">has </span>been
committed and that if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused
may be convicted on the basis thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court also concluded that the testimonies of the witnesses for the
prosecution were "positive, categorical, and unequivocal" and given
in a direct, coherent, and forthright manner.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
We are bound by such a finding.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Well-settled is the rule that appellate courts will generally not disturb the
findings of the trial court considering that it is in a better position to decide
the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their
deportment and manner of testifying during the trial, unless the court has
plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if considered,
might affect the result of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further confirmation of Emily's account came from Dr. Willie <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span>, the examining physician who, after examining her
physically barely twelve (12) hours after the incident, found the presence of
fresh injuries on her body which were explained to have been caused by the
force applied on the victim resulting in trauma and hyperemia (blood
congestion) due to the forceful penetration of a hard object, like a penis,
into the vaginal wall.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for the crime of robbery with rape under the second
paragraph of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code is <i><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <u>temporal</u></span></i><span style=""> </span>in its medium period to <i><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span></span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
consists of three (3) periods, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) the minimum period, which <span style="">is<i>
<u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u></i> in </span>its medium period; (b) the
medium period, which <span style="">is<i> <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u></i> </span>in its maximum period; and (c) the maximum period,
which is <i><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span></span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Since
the crime was committed without any aggravating or mitigating circumstance, the
penalty should be imposed in its medium period,<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
i.e., <i><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <u>temporal</u></span></i><span style=""> in </span>its maximum period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant is, therefore, entitled to the

Accordingly, he can be sentenced to a penalty whose <u><span style="">minimum</span></u><span style=""> </span>shall
be within the range of the penalty next lower to that prescribed by the Revised
Penal Code as indicated above, and whose <u>maximum</u> shall be <i><u><span style="">reclusion</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <u>temporal</u></span></i><span style=""> </span>in its maximum period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, We hereby modify the sentence imposed by the trial
court by imposing upon the appellant the penalty of Ten (10) years and One (1)
day of <span class="SpellE"><i><u><span style="">prision</span></u></i></span><i><span style=""> <u>mayor</u></span></i><span style=""> as </span><u>MINIMUM</u>, to Eighteen (18)

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered AFFIRMING, in all
respects, the decision appealed from except as to the penalty which is hereby
modified <span style="">as </span>above indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As modified, appellant BAYANI DE LOS REYES y
PUSTIGO is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Ten (10) years and One (1)
day of <span class="SpellE"><i><u>prision</u></i></span><i> <u>mayor</u></i> as
MINIMUM, to Eighteen (18) years and Eight (8) months of <i><u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u></i>
