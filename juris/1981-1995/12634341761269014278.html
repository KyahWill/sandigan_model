				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner is challenging the purported sale to the private
respondents of two parcels of land which he claims as his own by right of
inheritance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said properties were part of the Buenavista Estate, which had
been purchased by the Republic of the Philippines for distribution among
landless tenants and farmers.   On April
1, 1955, <span style="">L</span>ot No. S-117 thereof,
covering <span style="">over </span>14,200 square
meters, was sold to Manuel de Leon by the Department of Agriculture on behalf
of the Republic.   On August 5, 1969, Lot
43 thereof, consisting of 11,847 square <span style="">meters, was also sold by the Republic, through the
Land Authority, to the heirs of Manuel de Leon, represented by the herein
petitioner, his grandson.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
first Deed of Sale carried the following limitation on the disposition of the
land:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. That it shall not
be sold, assigned, encumbered, mortgaged or transferred, within the period of
five (5) years from the date hereof without first obtaining the written <span style="">consent of the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. That except by
hereditary succession, it shall not be conveyed, transferred or assigned in
favor of any person who is not landless and disqualified to acquire or own land
in the Philippines.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
second sale was subject to a similar condition, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. That except by
hereditary succession it shall not be subdivided, <span style="">sold or </span>in any manner transferred or encumbered, within the <span style="">period of FIFTEEN
(15) years from the date of execution hereof, without first obtaining the
written consent of the Governor of the Land Authority and only to persons who
are qualified to purchase said land under Commonwealth Act No. 539, Republic
Act No. 1162, as amended, Republic Act No. 1400 as amended and/or Republic Act
No. 3844 or to government banking institutions or agencies or to any private
banking institutions.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On
July 24, 1969, the herein private respondents filed a complaint against the
petitioner for partition of the lands and accounting in the Court of First
Instance of Bulacan.   They alleged that
they had bought 1/2 of the lands from Maria de los Santos, the widow of Manuel
de Leon, by virtue of a "Tuluyang Bilihan" dated March 18, 1959.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>She had
failed to deliver possession to them until her death on February 5, 1960.   The petitioner, who had succeeded her in the
lands, had resisted their demands for accounting of the income from the said
properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer, the petitioner averred that the properties
belonged to him as the sole heir of Manuel de Leon.   The alleged "Tuluyang Bilihan" was a nullity because
Maria de los Santos had no authority to convey the properties during the
prohibited period without the written consent of the appropriate authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, Judge Benigno M. Puno sustained the private
respondents in a decision dated April 15, 1977.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> This
was affirmed on appeal by the respondent court on February 16, 1989, and
reconsideration was denied on June 15, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals agreed that the “Tuluyang Bilihan” was
genuine and valid and that the alleged lack of the stipulated written consent
could be invoked only by the Republic of the Philippines and not by the
petitioner.   He was not a party to the
"Tuluyang Bilihan." Besides, the said stipulations were not
applicable to cases of hereditary succession, and De los Santos, who sold the
lands, was the heir of her husband, Manuel de Leon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has come to this Court for relief.   Specifically, he claims that the Court of
Appeals should not have recognized the "Tuluyang Bilihan" as valid
because the contents thereof were not explained to Maria de los Santos.   He repeats his argument that the sale,
assuming it <span style="">was </span>not simulated,
violated the conditions above-quoted and was therefore void.   He also insists that the complaint was barred
by laches or prescription and that he should not have been prevented from
invoking the dead man's statute.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold first of all that the stipulations in the first deed of
sale in favor of Manuel de Leon were binding on his heirs, were also bound,
directly this time, by the similar stipulations in the second deed of sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The purpose of these stipulations was to keep within the family
the property <span style="">which </span>the
government had sold to <span style="">the </span>tenant
or farmer for a minimal cost to enable him to acquire his own land.   Hence, it was necessary for Maria de los
Santos, before selling the subject properties to the private respondents, to
first secure the written consent to such sale of the Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources (in the case of the first lot) and of the Governor of the
Land Authority (in the case of the second lot).</p>

<p class="BODY">The only exception to the said conditions is when the land is
acquired by or transferred to another person by hereditary succession.   Thus, when the lands were inherited by Maria
de los Santos as the surviving spouse of Manuel de Leon, there was no need for
such written consent.   But such consent
was still necessary when, as transferee of the properties, she later sold them
to the private <span style="">respondents.   The lands were transferred to the private </span>respondents
by virtue of the "Tuluyang <span style="">Bilihan"
</span>and not by hereditary succession.   To be valid, therefore, the sale needed the written consent of the
above-named officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no pretense that such consent was <span style="">ever obtained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree with the respondent court that because <span style="">Maria </span>de los Santos acquired the
subject lands by hereditary succession, she was thereby released from the
conditions of the sales made on April 1, 1955, and August 5, 1969.   There is no reason why, as heir, she should
be treated less strictly than <span style="">her
predecessor-in-interest in </span>the disposition of the lands during the <span style="">prohibited period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has held <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>It is undisputed that <span style="">Free </span>Patent
No. 298112 was issued to <span style="">petitioner </span>Apolonio
Egao over Lot <span style="">No.
</span>662 on 12 August, 1965.   Sec. 118
of Commonwealth Act <span style="">No. </span>141, as
amended, prohibits the alienation or encumbrance, within a period of five (5)
years from the date of issuance of the patent, of lands acquired <span style="">under </span>free patent or homestead.   Assuming, <u><span style="">arguendo</span></u><span style="">, </span>the
authenticity of the <span style="">Deeds of Sale
executed by the Egaos in favor of Marfori over portions of Lot No. 662 (the
land in question), dated 7 May 1964, </span>14 January and 6 October 1965, it
clearly appears that all deeds were executed within the prohibited period of
five (5) years.   As correctly found by
the appellate court -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Section 124 of the Public Land <span style="">is </span>Act provided (sic) that any
acquisition, conveyance, alienation, transfer or other contract made or
executed in violation of any of the provisions of Sections 118, 121, 120, 122
and 123 of this Act shall be unlawful, null and void from its execution and
shall produce the effect of annulling and cancelling the grant, title, patent
or permit originally issued, recognized or confirmed, actually or
prescriptively, and cause the reversion of the property and its improvements to
the state.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 283.5pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">x    x  x</p>

<blockquote>Deeds of sale of patented lands, perfected within the prohibited
five (5) year period are null and void (Sec. 124, Public Land Act).   No title passed from the Egaos to Marfori
which could be validly transferred to herein respondents Bontilao and Dignos.   <u>Nemo dat quod </u><u><span style="">non </span>habet</u> (nobody can dispose of
that which does not belong to him).<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x The restrictions and qualifications attached to every
alienation of these lands are mandatory, with the primordial aim to preserve land
grants to the family of the applicant for free patent.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x The provision of the law which prohibits the sale or
encumbrance of the homestead within five years after the grant of the patent is
mandatory, the purpose of the law being to promote a definite public policy,
which is to preserve and keep in the family of the patentee that portion of the
public land which the State has gratuitously given to them.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x [W]e have consistently ruled that a sale of the homestead within
the 5-year prohibitive period is void <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u> and the same
cannot be ratified nor can it acquire validity through the passage of time.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While these cases referred to homestead and free patents, we do
not see why the above doctrine should not also apply to the case at bar.   The reason for the <span style="">distribution </span>and sale of the
Buenavista Estate was also to promote the distribution of land for the landless
conformably to the <span style="">constitutional intent.   While </span>it
is true that the lots were not granted outright or for free, the purchase price
thereof was intentionally minimal, precisely to enable the buyers to acquire
the lots under the easiest terms.   Thus,
in the dispute before us, the first lot was sold for only P177.50 and the
second lot for only P236.94.   The two
lots covered a total area of more than two and a half hectares.</p>

<p class="BODY">In holding that only the Republic of the Philippines could
question the validity of the "Tuluyang Bilihan" on the ground of
non-compliance with the consent stipulations, the Court of Appeals is supported
by ample jurisprudence.   Thus:</p>

<blockquote>Furthermore, a private individual may not bring an action for
reversion or any action which would have the effect of <span style="">cancelling a free patent and the
corresponding certificate of title </span>issued on the basis thereof, with the
result that the land covered thereby will again form part of the public domain,
as the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead may do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x
x x </span>[T]he forfeiture of <span style="">a </span>homestead is a matter between the State
and the grantee or his heirs, and that until the State had taken steps to annul
the grant and asserts title to the homestead the purchaser is, <span style="">as against </span>the
vendor or his heirs, no more entitled to keep the land than any intruder.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x[W]hen <span style="">a </span>grant of land <span style="">is </span>made by the government, the question of
its validity is a matter between the grantor and the grantee, and unless the
point is raised by the Government and the grant <span style="">is </span>set aside, a third person cannot
question the legality of the concession.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, no less than Manresa has expressed the
contrary view, based on the public policy that an heir, like the herein
petitioner, cannot be prevented from inheriting property rightfully belonging
to his predecessor.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, as the "Tuluyang Bilihan" was null and void
<u><span style="">ab initio</span></u><span style="">, </span>ownership of the disputed lands was
not transferred to the private respondents but remained with Maria de los
Santos.   The Republic of the
Philippines, if not the petitioner, may still ask for the reversion of the
properties to the State for violation of the conditions in the deeds of sale.   Meanwhile the petitioner would have
preferential rights of possession thereover <u><span style="">vis-a-vis</span></u><span style=""> </span>the
private respondents, who rely only on the void "Tuluyang Bilihan."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as we held in the Egao case:</p>

<blockquote>While the government has not taken steps to assert its title, by
reversion, to a homestead sold in violation of the Public Land Act, the vendor
or his heirs is better entitled to the possession of the land, the vendee being
<span style="">in </span>no better situation than any
intruder.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>is only fair, however,
that the private respondents be allowed to at least recover the purchase price
of the land, with legal interest from the time of the execution of the Tuluyang
Bilihan until the refund is actually made.   This ruling is based on the findings of the lower court that the
said instrument, although deficient for lack of the required consent, was
validly executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall support this factual finding because the petitioner was
rather ambivalent in assailing the authenticity of the "Tuluyang
Bilihan." At first he doubted its genuineness because it was only
thumbprinted and not signed by Maria de los Santos.   On appeal, he alleged that the contents of the instrument should
have been explained to her because she was illiterate.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the above resolutions, it is no longer necessary to
examine the other objections raised in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the challenged decision of the Court
of Appeals is <span style="">REVERSED </span>and a new
judgment is rendered:   a) declaring the
"Tuluyang Bilihan" dated March 18, 1959, null and void <u><span style="">ab initio</span></u><span style=""> </span>for violation of the conditions stipulated in the Deed of Sale
dated April 1, 1955, and the Deed <span style="">of </span>Sale
dated August 5, 1969; b) recognizing the petitioner's preferential right to the
possession of the subject properties, without prejudice to the right of the
State to ask for its reversion to it for violation of the conditions of the
said Deeds of Sale; and c<span style="">) </span>requiring
the petitioner to refund to the private respondents the amount of P2,300.00,
the consideration of the annulled "Tuluyang Bilihan," with legal
interest thereon from March 18, 1959, until it is fully paid.   No pronouncement as to costs.</p>
