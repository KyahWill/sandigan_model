<p class="BODY">Whether or not the judicial interpretation of the lease contract 
amounts to the courts' contracting for the parties is the issue in this petition 
for review of the decision of the then Intermediate Appellate Court which upheld 
the Court of First Instance of Manila's dismissing the petitioner's complaint 
for recovery of the balance of unpaid rentals due for one year under the lease 
contract in question.</p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioner leases out office spaces in her building at 
<st1:street><st1:address>#494 <span class="SpellE">Soldado</span> 
Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>, 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The lessee in 
the disputed lease contract was designated as <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. 
<span class="SpellE">Niño</span> Travel and Tour Agency, a sole proprietorship 
duly organized and existing under the laws of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
represented by private respondent Ely <span class="SpellE">Fuderanan</span>, its 
President and General Manager.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="15" year="1980">May 15, 
1980</st1:date>, the petitioner <span>received </span>the sum of P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as "reservation deposit" for Apartment No. 116 at 
<st1:place><st1:placename>Luz</st1:placename> <st1:placename>J.</st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Henson</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> for which she issued a 
receipt to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Fuderanan</span> as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="3Q">"This reservation is good up to <st1:date month="5" day="15" year="1980">May 15, 1980</st1:date>, at <st1:time hour="16" minute="0">4:00 
P.M.</st1:time>; failure to sign the Lease Contract, pay the required Three (3) 
months advance rental and Three (3) <span>months guarantee </span>deposits, the 
reservation is forfeited, monthly rental is P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> — 
net of W. H. Tax. Lease Contract is for one year."</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">On the same day, the petitioner and private respondent <span class="SpellE">Fuderanan</span> entered into a lease contract which, in part, 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="3Q">"1. <span>&nbsp;</span>That this contract shall have a duration of one 
year, commencing from May 15, 1980; Provided that, at the expiration hereof, the 
lease shall be deemed renewed on a month to month basis under the same terms and 
conditions as this contract, unless either party, at least one month before this 
contract expires, informs the other in writing of his desire not to be bound 
anymore after said period; Provided Further, that should LESSEE terminate this 
contract before its termination or be cancelled for any of the causes 
enumerated, the LESSEE shall for his breach of this contract, have his guarantee 
deposit automatically forfeited and still be liable to LESSOR as penalty and 
liquidated damages for the rentals of the unexpired portion of this lease, 
irrespective of whether or not LESSOR subsequently finds another person to lease 
the vacated premises for the duration of said unexpired portion;</p>
<p class="3Q">"2. <span>&nbsp;</span>That LESSEE agrees to pay rentals for the premises 
leased as above-described at the rate of TWO THOUSAND PESOS Net of Withholding 
Tax (P2,000.00), Philippine Currency, a month, due and payable without need of 
further demand and notice on the due date of the corresponding month, at <span class="SpellE">LESSOR's</span> office or residence; LESSEE shall pay in advance 
the amount of SIX THOUSAND PESOS (P6,000.00), Philippine Currency, as rentals 
for the first two (2) months of this contract and one month end of lease.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Rentals are payable monthly in advance.<span>&nbsp; </span>A fraction of a 
month is considered one month rental;</p>
<p class="3Q">"Upon execution of this contract, the LESSOR (should be LESSEE) 
(shall) deposit with the LESSOR the amount equivalent to SIX THOUSAND PESOS 
(P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>), three months rental.<span>&nbsp; </span>This 
deposit shall answer for any damages, losses, breakage, utilities destroyed 
including damages caused by renovation done on the leased premises and any 
extensions thereof, and shall be returned only upon expiration of this Lease 
Contract; Provided, that all <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> Bills are fully 
paid and that charges for any and all long distance calls are paid duly 
certified by the PLDT Co.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nothing herein contained shall be 
understood as granting the LESSEE the right to require, before the termination 
of this lease, that this deposit shall be applied against over due rentals and 
other outstanding accounts owing to LESSOR in order to keep the <span class="SpellE">LESSEE's</span> account current, deposits bear <span>no 
</span>interest."</p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the lease contract between the petitioner and private 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Fuderanan</span>, the latter paid Henson the 
amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in cash as deposit for rentals, 
water service and four keys (Exhibit A-1) and P1,660.00 in cash and P4,640.00 in 
a postdated check as rentals due from May 15, 1980 to July 14, 1980 (Exhibit 
A-1; Exhibit D).<span>&nbsp; </span>This postdated check was later replaced by 
another postdated check of private respondent Luisa <span class="SpellE">Commendador</span> which was dishonored due to insufficiency of 
funds as indicated by the bank's dishonor slip (Exhibit D-1).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1980">May 30, 
1980</st1:date>, the Chief of the Licensing and Inspection Division of the 
Bureau of Tourism Services, Ministry of Tourism disapproved the request of the 
private respondents to transfer their office to the premises owned by the 
petitioner on the ground that the place failed to meet the minimum 50 square 
meter-space requirement of the Bureau (Exhibit 6).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="10" year="1980">June 10, 
1980</st1:date>, the private respondents informed the petitioner in writing that 
they had to vacate the leased premises in question on or about <st1:date month="6" day="14" year="1980">June 14, 1980</st1:date> in view of the 
disapproval of their request to operate their business in the office space 
rented from the petitioner (Exhibit B).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="16" year="1980">June 16, 
1980</st1:date>, the petitioner notified the private respondents in writing of 
the dishonor of <span class="SpellE">Commendador's</span> postdated check (Exhibit 
C).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="7" day="9" year="1980">July 9, 
1980</st1:date>, the petitioner wrote the private respondents demanding that 
they make good their dishonored check in compliance with the terms and 
conditions of their lease contract (Exhibits F and F-1).</p>
<p class="BODY">On July 18, 1980, the private respondents replied by stating that 
they had to rescind the lease contract and requested the refund of the amounts 
they paid by way of advance and deposit rentals less the amount of rental due 
(Exhibit 5).<span>&nbsp; </span>Their request was not granted by the petitioner 
(Exhibits E and E-1).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="16" year="1981">January 16, 
1981</st1:date>, the petitioner filed an action against the private respondents 
to recover the value of the dishonored check worth P4<span class="GramE">,640.00</span> plus 12% interest per annum from <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1980">May 30, 1980</st1:date> until paid and the amount of 
P22,000.00 as rental fees corresponding to the unexpired portion of the term of 
the lease contract between them.</p>
<p class="BODY">On March 24, 1982, the private respondents filed their answer, 
which was later amended on July 29, 1981, alleging, among others, that private 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Commendador</span> was wrongly sued because she 
was not a party to the lease contract having issued the check merely for <span class="SpellE">accomodation</span> purposes; that the private respondents did not 
make good the dishonored check since the Ministry of Tourism had disapproved 
their request to transfer their office to the petitioner's premises; and that 
under the circumstances the private respondents had no other alternative but to 
rescind the lease contract and vacate the premises.<span>&nbsp; </span>A counterclaim 
was filed for the refund of P6<span class="GramE">,200.00</span> representing the 
advance rentals paid by the private respondents and for the award of moral 
damages, attorney's fees, and expenses of litigation.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>After trial, the trial court, on </span><st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1982"><span>March 18, 1982</span></st1:date><span>, rendered 
judgment in favor of the private respondents.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision 
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the complaint of 
the plaintiff Luz J. Henson against the defendants Ely <span class="SpellE">Fuderanan</span> and Luisa <span class="SpellE">Commendador</span>, 
doing business under the name and style '<span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span>Niño</span></span><span> </span>Travel and Tours Agency,' and 
upon the latter's counterclaim against the former, ordering the plaintiff to 
refund to the defendants the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the 
plaintiff."</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>A motion for reconsideration was denied in a resolution dated <st1:date month="10" day="9" year="1985">October 9, 1985</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, 
this present petition assigning as errors the following:</p>
<p style="margin: 15pt 0in;" class="NUMROMANS" align="center">I</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="2Q">The Intermediate Appellate Court erred when its decision 'made a new 
contract' for the parties.</p></blockquote>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center">II</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="2Q">The Intermediate Appellate Court erred in rendering a decision not 
sanctioned by equity.</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The Intermediate Appellate Court dismissed the petitioner's 
complaint thereby giving the private respondents the right to a refund of the 
sum they advanced as rental fees when they executed the contract of 
lease.<span>&nbsp; </span>The court did not find the private respondents in breach of 
their obligations under said contract.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the words of the 
appellate court:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="2Q">"The reason for the non-compliance of the obligation to occupy the 
leased premises came from a third party."</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">By "third party", it meant the Chief of 
the Licensing and Inspection Division of the Bureau of Tourism Services, 
Ministry of Tourism.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We </span>are constrained under the circumstances of this 
case to uphold the time-honored principle that contracts are respected as the 
law between the contracting parties (<em>Castro v. Court of Appeals</em>, 99 
SCRA 722; <span class="SpellE"><em>Escano</em></span><em> v. Court of 
Appeals</em>, 100 SCRA 197).<span>&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the lease 
contract executed by the petitioner and the private respondents remains as the 
law between them.<span>&nbsp; </span>In litigations involving the adjudication of 
rights and obligations between the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and the 
lessee, the lease contract shall govern (<em>Chua Peng</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Hian</em></span><em> v. Court of Appeals</em>, 133 SCRA 
572).</p>
<p class="BODY">The disputed lease contract is plain and unequivocal in its 
terms.<span>&nbsp; </span>The stipulations are expressed in clear and explicit 
language that leaves no doubt as to the intention of the contracting 
parties.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nowhere is it provided in the contract that the 
fulfillment of the terms and conditions of the lease depend upon an act of a 
third party, <em>i.e.</em>, the final action to be taken by the Chief of the 
Licensing and Inspection Division of the Bureau of Tourism.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Neither is there any indication from the evidence presented that would 
justify either of the contracting parties to impugn the lease contract they 
executed.</p>
<p class="BODY">The facts of the case constrain us to apply the rule that 
contracts are to be interpreted according to their literal meaning when the 
terms and conditions are clear and leave no doubt as to the intention of the 
<span>contracting parties (<em>Gonzales v. Court of Appeals</em>, 124 SCRA 630; 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Matienzo</em></span><em> v. Servidad</em>, 107 SCRA 276; 
see also Article 1370 of the Civil Code of the Philippines).<span>&nbsp; </span>It 
was error on the part of the appellate court to make room for construction of 
the provisions of the subject lease contract when the case plainly calls for 
application thereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>We reiterate our ruling in the case of 
<em>San Mauricio Mining Company v. Ancheta</em> (105 SCRA 371, 418) 
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" class="2Q" align="center"><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span>xxx<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="2Q">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The primary and elementary rule of construction of 
documents is that when the words or language thereof is clear and plain or 
readily understandable by any ordinary reader thereof, there is absolutely no 
room for interpretation or construction anymore.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> 
(See also <span class="SpellE"><em>Pichel</em></span><em> v. Alonzo</em>, 111 SCRA 
341)</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The first stipulation in the disputed lease contract provided for 
a specific period of one year as the duration of the lease.<span>&nbsp; </span>This 
ought to be followed (See <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de 
<st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city> v. Tan</em>, 116 SCRA 
447).<span>&nbsp; </span>For the respondent court to hold that the private 
respondents-lessees are justified in disregarding their obligation to pay for 
the leased premises throughout the term of the lease due to the requirement of 
the Ministry of Tourism that travel agencies must operate their business in an 
area mandated by the rules is tantamount to the court's revising the contract 
for the parties.<span>&nbsp; </span>The courts, be it the original trial court or the 
appellate court, have no power to make contracts for the parties (<em>Top-Weld 
Manufacturing, Inc. v. ECED, S.A.</em>, 138 SCRA 118).</p>
<p class="BODY">Given the simple and unambiguous document of lease in this case, 
the lessees, at the most, would be entitled <span>to a refund of the advance 
rental fees only if the rule on equity can be applied under the 
circumstances.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, there are no circumstances in this case 
that warrant the application of equitable considerations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The predicament in which <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span> <span class="SpellE">Niño</span> Travel and Tour 
Agency found <span class="GramE">itself</span> is entirely of its own 
making.<span>&nbsp; </span>It should have ascertained all the rules and requirements 
for the operation of a travel agency before it even started to look for premises 
to house its office.<span>&nbsp; </span>The petitioner had absolutely nothing to do 
with the private respondents' violating the requirements.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Moreover, the record shows that the petitioner-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> offered the occupancy of the bigger rooms in her 
apartments for lease to the <span class="SpellE">the</span> private respondents in 
order that they could meet the minimum space requirement of 50 square meters 
ordered by the Ministry of Tourism.<span>&nbsp; </span>The private respondents 
declined the offer because they were not willing to pay for the corresponding 
increase in the rental fees.</p>
<p class="BODY">The appellate court opined that the petitioner, in offering the 
bigger rooms for lease at a higher rent value, gave the private respondents no 
other choice but to stop the operation of their travel agency business as 
against renting one of the bigger rooms and operating at a loss in view of the 
increased rental fees.<span>&nbsp; </span>The records do not show upon what evidence 
the respondent court based this finding.<span>&nbsp; </span>The questioned decision 
itself shows that the court's conclusion is purely conjectural and cannot 
support the application of equity.<span>&nbsp; </span>It states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="3Q"><span>"However, </span>the record shows 
that defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> finally rejected leasing 
these larger rooms because the rents were 'different'.<span>&nbsp; <em>We 
presume</em></span> that, by the word 'different', <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> meant the rents were higher which they could not 
afford." (Emphasis supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The rule that travel agencies should have at least 50 square 
meters of office space is a reasonable regulation intended to dignify the 
business as a whole and avoid fly-by-night operators working out of cramped and 
dingy quarters.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the private respondents did not bother to look 
into this requirement before entering into a lease contract, they have no right 
to visit upon the petitioner the results of their negligence.</p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that under the disputed lease contract, 
the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is not bound to make sure that her lessee 
realizes profit out of the latter's travel agency business while occupying the 
leased premises in the same way that it is not incumbent upon her to see to it 
that her lessee observes the regulatory measures laid down by the Ministry of 
Tourism for travel agencies.<span>&nbsp; </span>She states that the only business 
with which she is concerned is that of leasing office spaces in her apartment 
building to those lessees who agree to the terms and conditions of the lease 
such as the private respondents.<span>&nbsp; </span>This may be a rigid and 
hardhearted approach to the problem but it is correct.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
contract of lease was never conditioned on the lessees' ability to comply with 
governmental requirements pertaining to their business.<span>&nbsp; </span>We also 
note that the contract was executed on <st1:date month="5" day="15" year="1980">May 15, 1980</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Part of the consideration was 
in the form of a postdated check for P4<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The denial by the Inspection Division of the Bureau of Tourism Services 
was dated <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1980">May 30, 
1980</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the postdated check fell due the following 
day, May 31, the funds to meet the <span>check were insufficient and the bank 
had to dishonor the check.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The private respondents argue that their failure to comply 
with their obligations under the lease contract may be justified by Stipulation 
No. 9 in the lease contract which provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="2Q">"Compliance <span class="GramE">With</span> Law. — The LESSEE shall 
promptly obey, execute and fulfill any and all laws, ordinances, rules, 
regulations and orders of the national or city government or of any bureau, 
board or commission for the sanitation and safety of the leased 
premises."</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> stipulation in the lease 
contract must be read in the context of the petitioner's business of leasing 
office spaces, not in that of the private respondents' travel agency 
business.<span>&nbsp; </span>The laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders 
which the lessee ought to obey, execute, and fulfill pertain to those relating 
to the business of the petitioner such as the payment of expenses for the deed 
of lease, the settlement of electric, water and phone bills or the installation 
of safety measures in cases of fire and other similar emergencies.</p>
<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing discussion, there is no question that the 
subject lease contract which is the law between the parties herein admits of no 
gap that the rule on equity may rightfully bridge.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The decision appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and a new one is 
rendered:</p>
