				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This Petition raises the issue of whether it is within the
corporate powers of the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) to waive the penalty
charges of P9<span class="GramE">,636.36</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">on </span>the loan of the Home Savings Bank and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Trust </span>Company (HSBTC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The LBP asserts that, as a banking institution, its Charter authorizes
it to condone claims or liabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission on Audit, on the other hand, maintains that such power is
exclusively vested <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the
Commission pursuant to Section 36 of Pres. Decree No. 1445, or the Government
Auditing Code.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records indicate that on 22 July 1980, the Board of Directors
of the LBP issued Resolution No. 80-222 (Rollo, pp.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> 4-5, </span>pp. 91-93) fixing the new rates for penalty charges on
past due loans/amortizations and other credit accommodations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Resolution also provided that "in
cases of defaults in loan payment and other credit accommodations due to
unforeseen, highly justifiable reasons/circumstances beyond the control of the
borrower <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">such </span>as damages due to
natural calamities, sickness, adverse government rulings or court judgments,
duly processed and verified by the lending units, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">penalty charges may be condoned/reduced by the Loan Executive Committee
upon recommendation of the appropriate lending units</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">" </span>(Underscoring supplied).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Pursuant to </span>this
Resolution, LBP, through its Loan Executive Committee, waived the penalty
charges in the amount of Nine Thousand Six Hundred Thirty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Six </span>Pesos and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Thirty </span>Six Centavos (P9<span class="GramE">,636.36</span>) on the
loan of HSBTC, a thrift banking <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">institution
</span>organized under Philippine laws (Rollo, p. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">On</span> <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="9">23 September 1986</st1:date>, LBP requested its
Corporate Auditor to pass in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">audit </span>its
waiver of the penalty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Said official questioned the waiver
and opined that the power to condone interests or penalties is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vested exclusively in </span>the COA but, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>the absence of a categorical ruling
on the matter applicable to a government banking institution, referred the LBP
request to the COA in a letter dated <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="1">20
 January 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In COA Decision No. 551, dated <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="6">29 June 1988</st1:date> (Annex "C", Petition, Rollo, p.
29), the COA held that the waiver is unauthorized and should outrightly be
disallowed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>audit, pursuant to
Pres. Decree No. 1445, Section 36, <u>infra</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reconsiderations successively sought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span>LBP met with denial in COA Decision
No. 701, dated <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="12">13 December 1988</st1:date>
(Annex "F", Petition, Rollo, p. 38), and in COA Decision No. 977,
dated <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="6">6 June 1989</st1:date> (Annex
"A", ibid., p. 25), both of which Decisions emphasized COA's
exclusive prerogative to settle and/or compromise claims.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this Petition and Amended Petition erroneously brought
under Rules 44 and 43 of the Rules of Court, respectively, the proper remedy
being that of <i>Certiorari</i> under Rule 65 (Article IX (A), Sec. 7, 1987
Constitution).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue for resolution is whether or not LBP is authorized to
compromise or release claims or liabilities in whole or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">in </span>part.</p>

<p class="BODY">COA maintains that it has the sole prerogative to compromise
liabilities to the Government pursuant to Section 36 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">of </span>Pres. Decree No. 1445, the Government Auditing Code, which
provides, <u>inter alia</u>, that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"Sec.

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the interest of the government so requires, the Commission may

liability not exceeding one hundred thousand pesos, the application for relief
therefrom shall be submitted, through the Commission and the Prime Minister,

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, LBP claims that it, too, has the power to
condone penalties being a commercial bank clothed with authority to exercise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">all </span>the general powers mentioned in
the Corporation Law and the General Banking Act, as provided in Section 75[12]
of its Charter, Rep. Act No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">3844, </span>as
amended by Pres. Decree No. 251, among which is the power to write off loans
and advances (General Banking <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Act, Sec.
84</span>, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">infra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">), </span>which necessarily includes the
lesser power to charge off interests and penalties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>LBP also submits that its Charter (Rep. Act
No. 3844, as amended), being a special law, should prevail over the general
grant of authority to COA by Pres. Decree No. 1445 to compromise claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with LBP.</p>

<p class="BODY">LBP was created <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>a
body corporate and government instrumentality to provide timely and adequate
financial support in all phases involved in the execution of needed agrarian
reform (Rep. Act No. 3844, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>amended,
Sec. 74).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 75 of its Charter
vests <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>LBP specific powers
normally exercised by banking institutions, such as the authority to grant
short, medium and long-term loans and advances against security of real estate
and/or other acceptable assets; to guarantee acceptance(s), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">credits, </span>loans, transactions or
obligations; and to borrow from, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">or </span>rediscount
notes, bills of exchange and other commercial papers with the Central
Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition to the enumeration of
specific powers granted to LBP, Section 75 of its Charter also authorizes it:</p>

<blockquote>"12. To
exercise the general powers mentioned in the Corporation Law and the General
Banking Act, as amended, insofar as they are not inconsistent or incompatible
with this Decree."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">One of the general powers mentioned in the General Banking Act is
that provided for in Section 84 thereof, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Writing-off loans and advances with an outstanding amount of
one hundred thousand pesos or more shall require the prior approval of the
Monetary Board" (As amended by PD 71).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will thus be seen that LBP <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is </span>a unique and specialized banking institution, not an ordinary
"government agency" within the scope of Section 36 of Pres. Decree
No. 1445.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a bank, it is specifically
placed under the supervision and regulation of the Central Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
pursuant to its Charter (Sec. 97, Rep. Act No. 3844, as amended by Pres. Decree
No. 251).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">so </span>far as loans and advances are concerned, therefore, it should
be deemed primarily governed by Central Bank Circular No. 958, Series of 1983,
which vests the determination of the frequency of writing-off loans in the
Board of Directors of a bank provided that the loans written-off do not exceed
a certain aggregate amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent portion of that Circular reads:</p>

<blockquote>"b<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Frequency</span>/ceiling
of write-off.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The frequency for
writing-off loans and advances shall be left to the discretion of the Board of
Directors of the bank concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, that the aggregate amount of loans and advances which may be
written-off during the year, shall in no case exceed 3% of total loans and
investments; Provided, further, that charge-offs are made against allowance for
possible losses, earnings during the year and/or retained earnings."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The authority to write-off loans and advances should be construed
to include within its scope the waiver of penalty charges on past due loans, which
are of a lesser category.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Concededly, the power to write-off is not expressly granted in
the LBP Charter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It can be logically
implied however, from LBP's authority to exercise the general <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">powers </span>vested in banking institutions as
provided in the General Banking Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
clear intendment of its Charter is for LBP to be clothed not only with the
express powers granted to it, but also with those implied, incidental and
necessary for the exercise of those express powers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"The test to be applied is whether the
act of the corporation is in direct and immediate furtherance of its business,
fairly incident to the express powers and reasonably necessary to their
exercise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">If so, the
corporation has the power to do it; otherwise, not" (Montelibano v.
Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co. Inc., L-15092, 18 May 1962, 5 SCRA 36).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It bears emphasizing that LBP was created to provide adequate
financial support to the agrarian reform program as well as to grant loans to
farmers' cooperatives/associations, and to finance and/or guarantee the
acquisition of farm lots transferred to tenant-farmers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its clientele consists primarily of agrarian
reform beneficiaries, landowners affected by agrarian reform and Land Bank bond-holders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should, therefore, be given some measure
of flexibility in its operations in order not to hamper it unduly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>the fulfillment of its
objectives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is only the
penalty charges on a past due loan of the HSBTC that are being condoned and not
the loan itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The criteria for waiver
are likewise specifically spelled out in LBP Resolution No. 80-222, namely, for
"unforeseen, highly justifiable reasons/circumstances beyond the control
of the borrower such as damages due to natural calamities, sickness, adverse
government ruling or court judgments, duly processed and verified by the
appropriate lending units."</p>

<p class="BODY">But while we rule that LBP is empowered by its corporate charter
to waive penalty charges, thereby overruling COA's avowed exclusive prerogative
to settle and compromise liabilities to the Government, nevertheless, pursuant
to Pres. Decree No. 1445, LBP is still subject to COA's general audit
jurisdiction to see to it that the fiscal responsibility that rests directly
with the head of the government agency has been properly and effectively
discharged (Section 25[1]), and as provided for in its Section 26, reading:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 26.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">General jurisdiction.</span>
- The authority and powers of the Commission shall extend to and comprehend all
matters relating to auditing procedures, systems and controls, the keeping of
the general accounts of the Government, the preservation of vouchers pertaining
thereto for a period <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of ten years, the
examination and inspection of the books, records, and papers relating to those
accounts, and the audit and settlement </span>of the accounts of all persons
respecting funds or property received or held by them in an accountable
capacity, as well as the examination, audit, and settlement of all debts and
claims of any sort due from or owing to the Government or any of its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">subdivisions, agencies and
instrumentalities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said jurisdiction
extends to all </span>government-owned or controlled corporations <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x x x."</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is but in keeping with the wide sphere of state audit set
forth in the fundamental law of the land.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2 (1) The Commission on Audit shall have the power,
authority, and duty to examine, audit, and settle all accounts pertaining to

original charters, x x x" (Article IX [D], Sec. 2[1], 1987 Constitution).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the foregoing conclusions, we find no need to
pass upon the other arguments raised.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
