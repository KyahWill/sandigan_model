				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A public office, regardless of hierarchy, is a public trust.  It is reserved for those who, faithful to
that trust, remain capable and willing to serve our country and people with
integrity and probity.  It is truly unfortunate
that an indictment against an entire bureaucracy often results and so many must
suffer from the wayward acts of so few.</p>

<p class="BODY">These consolidated cases were spawned by the reported "ghost
project" in 1978 by the Benguet Highway Engineering District under the
then Ministry of Public Highways.  Herein petitioners were among those originally charged before the then
Court of First Instance of Baguio for violation of Section 3, paragraph (e), of
Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act, and for estafa thru falsification of public documents
in, respectively, Criminal Case No. 707 and Criminal Case No. 708.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before petitioners' arraignment, the Sandiganbayan and the
Tanodbayan were created.  Pursuant to
Section 8 of Presidential Decree No. 1486, the two cases were transferred to
the Sandiganbayan (docketed Criminal Cases No. 010 and No. 011).  The amended information in Criminal Case No.
010 for violation of the Anti-Graft Law, filed on 04 April 1978, read:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: left;" align="left"><u>Evidence</u> <u>for</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Prosecution</u></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented its evidence, narrated thusly:</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly before the scheduled Batasan Pambansa election in April
of 1978, then President Ferdinand Marcos was informed by Ben Palispis, Governor
of Benguet, of the deteriorated condition of the Halsema (Baguio-Bondoc)
Highway.  Acting on this report, the
President, through then Minister of Public Highways Baltazar Aquino, directed
Santiago Paragas, district engineer of the Benguet Highway Engineering District
("BHED"), in the presence of Eugenio Manalo, Public Highways Director
for Region I, to immediately undertake repairs on said highway.  In March 1978, Eusebio Fonacier, supervising
civil engineer of the BHED, instructed Ruben Buccat, a district civil engineer,
to prepare a program of work ("PW") for the Halsema Highway under
cover of a P10 million development fund.  Fonacier and Buccat visited the highway in April 1978.  During the same month, Buccat went to Km.
271 to 276 of the highway and placed stakes or markers for the installation of
culverts.  He noticed that the road
continued to deteriorate and mounds of gravel were at the roadside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following Fonacier's instruction, Buccat prepared the PW.  The PW was forwarded by the BHED to the
regional office in Bauang, La Union.  The PW was later revised upon the representation of Governor Palispis
who wanted the road to be concreted, not merely asphalted.  In the revised PW, the regional office
suggested that the construction station be situated along Habatan road or Km.
335 instead of along Km. 271 to 276.  Buccat was told by Fonacier to prepare the time spot schedule.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The PW for the concreting of Km. 271 to 276 was submitted in July 1978 to, and
approved only in January 1979 by, Public Highways Minister Aquino.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending the Minister's approval, the processing of other
documents required to implement the Halsema Highway project continued.  On 20 April 1978, Remedios Gacad, an
accountant at the BHED, signed a requisition for supplies and equipment
("RSE"),<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
bearing the signature of Fonacier, with an allotment of P270,500.00.  Gacad entered the RSE in her Journal
Analysis of Obligation<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> which
she thereafter brought to the administrative office of the BHED.</p>

<p class="BODY">In May 1978, Fonacier designated Buccat to be the resident
engineer for the Halsema project.  Buccat was asked to prepare the statement of work accomplished
("SWA") which would indicate the delivery of the road materials for
Phase II of the project (the asphalting of Km. 271 to 276).  It was the first time that Buccat learned of
such assignment.  Since he had not seen
as yet the deliveries covered by the SWA, Buccat told Fonacier that he would
first check them out.  Fonacier replied
that there was no need for that because he (Fonacier) himself had personally
seen the deliveries.  Fonacier also
assured Buccat that he (Fonacier) would continue to supervise the
deliveries.  Since Buccat was busy with
Phase I of the Halsema project which entailed the asphalting of the overlay of
the road shoulders from the junction of Pico to the foot of the bridge in front
of the Capitol Building of La Trinidad, Benguet, or about ten kilometers from
Km. 271, Buccat agreed to sign the two sheets of SWA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later that day, Fonacier asked Buccat to prepare the tally sheets
("TSs") and the delivery receipts ("DRs").   Fonacier gave to Buccat a list of dump
trucks, with their corresponding plate numbers, volume and dimension, which,
according to Fonacier, were used in delivering Item 108, an aggregate sub-base
construction material with mixed gravel, stones and sand.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> The
DRs were in blank mimeographed forms while the TSs bore the signature in red
ink of Arnulfo Sarmiento, an audit clerk of the COA assigned at the BHED.  Buccat left all these papers in his locker
and proceeded to the site of the asphalt overlay project.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day before retiring for the day, Buccat went to the BHED
office to get the blank mimeographed forms and, following the instructions of
Fonacier, he cut each of them in triplicates, stapled them and filled in the
blanks using for reference the list of dump trucks furnished by Fonacier.  Buccat was finally able to prepare and sign
close to 10% of the DRs in four or f<span style="">ive
</span>days.  Buccat would report to
Fonacier every morning before going to his assigned project site, and each time
the latter would find occasion to inquire about the DRs.  Buccat would answer that he had yet to
complete them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 25 May 1978, Francisco del Moral, a private contractor,
brought to accountant Gacad two general vouchers ("GV"), numbered
8410 and 8412,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
already signed by Fonacier and Francisco Villanueva (the acting property
custodian).  Attached to the GVs were
the RSE, canvass paper, approved purchase order ("PO"), abstract of
bids, report of inspection and materials test signed by Ramos.  While Gacad was processing the first GV,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
she inquired from Del Moral about the DRs which were required to be part of the
documents.  Del Moral took out from a
brown envelope a bundle of documents, 1/8 of a coupon bond in size, 5 to 6
inches thick and bound by a rubber band, stating that they were the delivery
receipts.  Seeing that on top of the
bundle was an already filled up DR, and having been told by Del Moral that
Paragas was waiting for the documents, Gacad affixed her initials on the
portion corresponding to "indexed by" of the GV.  Gacad had no reason to doubt that the
supporting papers were complete since the GVs already appeared to have been
signed by Fonacier and Villanueva.  While she was processing the second GV,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Gacad once again asked Del Moral about the DRs.  Del Moral again brought out from an envelope a bundle of
documents.  Believing that these were
the same DRs earlier shown to her by Del Moral, Gacad merely glanced at the
receipts and affixed her signature on the GV.</p>

<p class="BODY">The GVs soon reached the desk of Josephine Carantes, acting chief
of the Internal Control Unit ("ICU"), for pre-audit.  Using a blue ink pen, Carantes checked the
stamped list of submitted documents against those shown by Del Moral consisting
of the approved RSE, approved PO, original invoice, report of inspection,
latest tax clearance, taxpayer's certificate, canvass and abstract of
bids.  She noticed certain crossed marks
in red ink on the list but she could not tell who placed them there.</p>

<p class="BODY">Carantes asked Del Moral for the DRs.  Del Moral retorted, "Why do you still have to check (them)
when those papers have already been checked by three different people in your
office?" He told her that he was in a hurry because Paragas was waiting
for the papers.  He then brought out
from an envelope two bundles of papers on top of which was what appeared to be
an already filled up DR.  When she asked
him, "Supposed they are not really delivery receipts?" Del Moral
replied, "They are really the ones because they have been scrutinized
already by these people.  Otherwise,
these people would not have affixed their signatures had they not been shown to
them." In finally initialing the GVs, Carantes affixed the abbreviated
word "Del" on the stamped list to indicate that the DRs were the
supporting documents in place of the original invoices.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Buccat stopped preparing the DRs when, in the BHED
office, Fonacier "whispered" to him that he should rush the
preparation of the DRs because "they" had already
"collected." Suspecting possible irregularities, Buccat tore into
pieces the DRs which he had prepared and signed, and he thereafter ceased to
further attend to the still unsigned DRs and the preparation of the TSs.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Fonacier saw Buccat the following day at the office, the
former, once more, reminded the latter to rush the preparation of the DRs.  Fearing the pressure, Buccat lamely answered
that he was still in the process of preparing the DRs.  Some time during the last week of May, 1978,
Buccat asked Fonacier and Del Moral how they were able to collect payment
despite the absence of the DRs; one of them answered, "<u>Utak</u> <u>lang</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Informed that the PW was already being implemented by the BHED
and that the subbase materials had been laid out, Director Manalo signed the
RSE on 22 May <span style="">1978.  </span>He had the RSE stamped for public
bidding.  On 06 June <span style="">1978, </span>he received a telegram<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
from Minister Aquino suspending the work at the Halsema Highway.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his report, dated 19 July <span style="">1978,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>to Director Manalo, Matias Ateo-an, a
civil engineer in the Maintenance Division, MPH, Region I, recommended that the
surface of Km. 271 to 276 be repaired immediately.  He also recommended that Item 200 should be used since the road
thereat was stable enough.  Ateo-an had
frequently gone home to Bontoc but he did not once see any pile of Item 108
along the stretch of Km. 271 to 276 between the months of April and July
1978.  He did see piles of Item 300
which he thought were part of the road rehabilitation program of the IBRD.</p>

<p class="BODY">A month earlier, or on 17 June 1978, Jose Dominguez, Vice
Chairman of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, Mountain Province, informed the
Provincial Fiscal, through a letter, of alleged irregularities and anomalies
concerning BHED projects along the Halsema Highway.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Governor Palispis requested for a meeting with Dominguez at his residence.  Coincidentally, Buccat also heard from an
engineer of the regional office that an investigation was being conducted in
connection with the delivery of road materials at Km. 271 to 276.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the first week of August 1978, Dominguez went to the
residence of Governor Palispis.  Dominguez brought with him documents consisting of a report on the
Halsema Highway project and sworn affidavits of witnesses.  He briefed the governor on the anomalies
attending the project.  Governor
Palispis requested Dominguez to make representations with the Provincial
Fiscal's Office to hold in abeyance any investigation pending further
verification of the matter.  The
governor was said to have been apprehensive that making public the incident
would alienate him from the people of Benguet.</p>

<p class="BODY">The governor and Dominguez met once again at the former's
residence.  During their meeting,
Dominguez scribbled a note<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
which read:</p>

<blockquote>"1 - SEEK HIS OWN TRANSFER</blockquote>

<blockquote>  2 - IF NO TRANSFER:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)  STOP FOOLISHNESS</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  PAL, COS, DOM, CAO</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)  NO MORE LOWLANDERS all c/o CEL</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  3 - </span>PROCEED WITH ACTION</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportEmptyParas]-->&nbsp;<!--[endif]--><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>  DECISION AUG. 29, 1978"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to Dominguez, it was the governor's idea that Paragas
should be transferred elsewhere.  The
"foolishness" meant were the rumored irregularities in the BHED.  The abbreviations "PAL, COS, DOM,
CAO" referred, respectively, to Governor Palispis, Assemblymen Cosalan,
Victor Dominguez and Fiscal Caoile of Benguet to whom the work program was to
be shown for checking.  Lowlander
contractors were to be excluded on account of the alleged "suspicious
contracts" being "bagged by lowlanders." The governor and
Dominguez agreed that, should these options fail, the case pending with the
Fiscal's office would then be pursued.</p>

<p class="BODY">A special panel, composed of special counsel Felix Cabading of the
Provincial Fiscal's Office and Assistant Fiscal Daniel Sarate, was created to
investigate the 17th June 1978 complaint of Dominguez.  The panel conducted an investigation from 03
to 23 October, 1978.  On 24 October
1978, the GVs were brought to Cabading's office by Resident Auditor Apolinario
Padilla.  When Cabading noticed that the
DRs and TSs were not among the papers shown, he inquired from Padilla whether
there were other documents aside from those already attached to the GVs.  Padilla answered that all have been
submitted.  Cabading did not mention
specifically the DRs and the TSs because, wanting to find out the extent of the
anomalies committed, he thought it to be prudent at the time that the concerned
officials were not unduly forwarned about the missing documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following the panel's investigation, <span style="">a </span>formal charge was filed on 08 November 1978 against the
accused.  Responding to a subpoena,
Buccat went to the Provincial Fiscal's Office the following day and executed
his sworn statement.  Two days later,
Fonacier, not knowing that Buccat had already executed a sworn statement, told
Buccat to report to the BHED after office hours.  When he arrived, Buccat found Fonacier, Paragas, Sarmiento, Del
Moral, Villanueva, BHED's Materials Testing Engineer Rogelio Ramos, several
contractors and one Atty. Tungpalan in the process of preparing some
affidavits.  Fonacier and Paragas told
Buccat to prepare the DRs to support the GVs and then handed to him a new list
of dump trucks and blank receipts.  Paragas placed his arm on Buccat's shoulder and said, <span style="">"<u>Gawin</u> </span><u><span style="">mo</span></u><span style=""> <u>na</u> <u>iyan</u> <u>at</u> </span><u><span style="">akong</span></u><span style=""> <u>bahala</u> </span><u>sa</u>
<u><span style="">itaas."</span></u><span style=""> </span>Buccat agreed to prepare the DRs to
give him an excuse to leave the meeting without signing the affidavit prepared
for him by Atty. Tungpalan.  During the
days following, in an effort to avoid Fonacier, Buccat would report directly to
the project site.  In one particular
instance, however, Buccat met Fonacier at the Fiscal's Office.  The latter told Buccat to prepare a logbook
where a summary of the aggregate materials that he supposedly had received
should be made to appear.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That same month of November 1978, Assemblyman Antonio Villar saw
Paragas, Padilla and one Atty. Vinci talking to Assemblyman Victor Dominguez at
the Batasan Pambansa in Manila.  Villar
did not hear their conversation.  Later,
however, Paragas requested Villar to accompany him (Paragas) to the house of
Assemblyman Dominguez.  The following
day, Villar, Paragas and Padilla went to the house of Assemblyman
Dominguez.  After a snack, <span style="">Villar </span>left to allow Paragas and
Padilla to talk privately with Dominguez.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 05 December 1978, Benjamin Galsim, City Auditor of Baguio,
received a telegram<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> from
COA General Counsel Fernandez directing Galsim to take immediate custody of GVs
Nos. 8410 and 8412 and their supporting documents which were still then in the
possession of the BHED Auditor and to submit these documents to Fiscal Caoile
in compliance with the latter's subpoena <u><span style="">duces</span></u><span style=""> <u>tecum</u>.  </span>When Galsim went to the BHED Office, Alvaro
Jasa, who took over the work of Padilla (on leave of absence at the time),
asked the assistance of Alviar in locating the GVs.  The documents were ultimately found inside a steel cabinet in a
bodega of the office.  Jasa then turned
over the documents <span style="">to </span>Galsim.  The latter scanned the documents; there were
no DRs.  Later, Jasa and Galsim made an
inventory<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
of the documents at the Provincial Fiscal's Office in the presence of Cabading
and Caoile.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;"><u>Evidence</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Defense</u></p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, the defense presented its evidence hereunder
detailed, viz:</p>

<p class="BODY">During the Holy Week of 1978 in Baguio City, Minister Aquino
verbally instructed Paragas in the presence of Director Manalo to prepare a PW
for the Halsema Highway with specific instructions to promptly repair the badly
damaged sections along Km. 271 to 276.  Paragas instructed Fonacier to form a team to conduct a survey of the
project site and to prepare the PW.  He
also issued a memorandum naming Buccat to be the Resident Engineer of the
project.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the directive of Paragas, both Fonacier and
Buccat inspected the project site and gathered the necessary data for the
preparation of the<span style=""> </span>PW.  The PW,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
signed by Buccat, Fonacier, Paragas and Assistant District Engineer Felimon
Garcia, was forwarded to the Regional Office for approval.  It was, however, returned to the BHED
without any action.  A few <span style="">days </span>later, a staff of the
Construction Division of the Regional Office, composed of Engineers Purugganan
and Collado, went to the BHED office to look into the Halsema Highway project
and to prepare a PW.  Fonacier
instructed Buccat to accompany them to the project site.</p>

<p class="BODY">Phase I of the PW was prepared by Purugganan and Phases <span style="">II, </span>III and IV by Collado.  These engineers noted that the road
materials in Km. 271 to 276 were "almost earth" that became muddy
when it rained.  Collado, taking into
account the traffic situation and the weather condition in the locality, then
recommended that Item 108 should be placed before Item 200.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 March 1978, when Fonacier was at the Regional Office,
Collado and Purugganan asked Fonacier to sign the PW which the two had
prepared.  Fonacier obliged and kept a
copy of the PW.  He later showed it to Paragas
who instructed Fonacier to implement it.  Fonacier examined the PW, took note of the materials needed and
submitted the list of materials to the Property Section for the preparation of
the RSE.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top: 12pt;">When Paragas learned that funds were
available for the project, he decided that a general bidding be conducted
without disclosing in the meantime the quantity of materials involved.  Paragas thought that since Director Manalo
had not yet approved the PW, the bidding should only be confined to obtaining
the prevailing prices of materials for future reference.  The notice of bidding, published on 19 and
26 March, 1978<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Del Moral, who happened to read the notices, went to the BHED and
secured from Cipriano Ismael, the Administrative Officer, a copy of an
invitation to bid.  After two days, Del
Moral went back to the BHED office and learned from Fonacier and Ismael the
subject items for the bidding and, from the Materials Testing Laboratory, the
sources of the road materials.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 March 1978, Paragas decided to postpone the general bidding
because only two out of the four bidders "prequalified." Del Moral
was one of the two who prequalified.  Paragas instructed Garcia, the chairman of the Bid and Award Committee,
to prepare new notices,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
informing various contractors that the bidding had been reset to 28 April
1978.  On account of limited BHED funds,
no publication of the new date of bidding was made.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 April 1978, Villanueva prepared the RSE, signed by
Fonacier, which Del Moral handcarried to the Accounting Section, then to
Ismael, Garcia and Paragas for their respective signatures.  The following day, Fonacier brought the RSE
to the Regional Office where it was also signed by Atty. Runez, Dioquino and
Director Manalo.  The RSE was returned
to the Property Section of the BHED on 24 April 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the rescheduled date of bidding, on 28 April 1978, the only
members of the Bid and Award Committee present were Ismael, Villanueva and
Almoite (the latter representing Padilla).  They opened the eight bids at 10:00 in the morning and shortly
thereafter declared to be the winning bidders Anitos Construction for Items
200, 300, 306-1 and 405, and Del Moral for Item 108.  Fonacier learned about the bidding and the names of the winning
bidders only when he saw a BHED employee typing the abstract of bids.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, Del Moral directed one of his men to instruct
his truck drivers to immediately make the deliveries of Item 108.  According to Felimon Dulay and Florencio
Alhambra, two of the truck drivers of Del Moral, no less than ten truckloads of
Item 108 were delivered, along Km. 271 to 276, daily from 28 April to 23 May
1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 April 1978, Gonzales, a field materials man, went to Km.
271 to km. 276 and got a half sack of the samples of construction materials
delivered by Del Moral.  When he arrived
at the BHED office, he found it already closed for the day.  He left the half sack of samples near the
office door and proceeded home.  The
next day, a holiday, Gonzales borrowed the office keys from Ramos, his
immediate supervisor, and went to the office to perform the required
tests.  He found that the samples met
the required specifications for Item 108.  Gonzales went five times to the project site during the month of
May.  Each time, he would perform tests
and submit a report to Ramos.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 02 May 1978, at the BHED office, Del Moral followed up the PO
and informed Fonacier that he had, since 28 April 1978, been making deliveries
of Item 108.  Fonacier relayed this
information to the Material Testing Laboratory and the Auditor.   He also instructed Buccat to inspect the
deliveries.  After visiting Km. 271 to
Km. 276, Buccat told Fonacier that the road materials were obstructing the
traffic.  Fonacier accordingly directed
Buccat to have Teodolfo Apostol, a grader operator, spread the road
materials.  While he was officially
assigned to the vicinity of Km. 257, Apostol, nonetheless, worked on the km.
271 to km. 276 portion every Monday, Wednesday and Friday of the week for close
to three weeks.  Apostol explained that
he failed to indicate in his daily time record<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> his
work along Km. 271 to 276 because the space provided therein for
"remarks" was "very short" aside from having done work on
that portion only for a brief period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 04 May 1978, Fonacier visited Km. 271 to 276 and saw piles of
road materials.  At another time, he
noticed that the piles had been spread out on the road.  He would also often see Buccat holding a
logbook recording the deliveries.  He
went to the site for the last time on 20 May 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">Audit clerk Sarmiento was asked as early as 26 April 1978 to
inspect the deliveries at the Halsema Highway.  He visited the site on 01 May 1978.  The following day, he saw Buccat with the "<u>camineros</u>".  Whenever he was at the project site,
Sarmiento would look at the logbook of Buccat, count the number of deliveries
posted and check each item with actual deliveries.  He observed that truck drivers would just present to Buccat the
report of deliveries and Buccat would thereupon record it in his logbook.  Buccat informed Sarmiento that he (Buccat)
would prepare the DRs in due time.  During certain occasions when Buccat would not be at the site, Sarmiento
himself listed the number of deliveries in a worksheet.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petra Mayos and Billy Sote, barangay captain and councilman,
respectively, of Caliking, testified that they regularly passed the Halsema
Highway and witnessed the delivery and spreading of earth mixed with stones
along Km. 271 to 276 in May 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 May 1978, Del Moral asked from Fonacier a partial payment
of his deliveries which, at the time, had been almost half of the 5,550 cu. m.
of the required Item 108.  Fonacier told
him to instead see Buccat who had the record of deliveries.  Buccat handed to Del Moral around 500 signed
DRs and 25 signed TSs.  Del Moral gave
the DRs and TSs to Sarmiento who, before himself signing them, checked the
signatures of the receiving officer and the resident engineer.  He crosschecked the entries on the receipts
with his record and Buccat's logbook.  Thereafter, the DRs and the TSs were likewise signed by Fonacier and
brought to the Property Section for preparation of the GV.</p>

<p class="BODY">While reviewing the DRs, property custodian Villanueva focused
special attention on the signatures of the resident engineer, the auditor's
representative and the project engineer, who, respectively, received, inspected
and noted the deliveries.  He also
examined the signatures appearing on the TSs and the volume of deliveries.  He saw on the upper left hand corner of a TS
a piece of adding machine tape with entries and figures, the total of which he
further checked with the volume appearing on the GV.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first GV,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
covering the partial delivery of 2,775 cu. m., was prepared and signed by
Villanueva and Fonacier.  A day after,
15 May 1978, Villanueva received the PO,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
signed the same and wrote "2,775 cu. m. partial" above his signature
to indicate that one-half of the total requisition of 5,550 cu. m. had been
delivered.  Noting that the date
appearing on the PO was 01 May 1978, a holiday, Villanueva instructed a
subordinate to correct it by placing the number "2"<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
over the figure "1".  Subsequently, Villanueva signed the Report of Inspection and corrected
the date 25 May 1978 appearing thereon by placing "1" over the figure
"2".  Aside from the PO, also
attached to the documents were the RSE, abstract of bids and invitation to
bid.  Del Moral then handcarried the
documents to the Accounting Section but because the other officials who were
required to sign the first GV were in Legazpi City attending a conference, Del
Moral decided to instead hold it until the next billing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 23 May 1978, Del Moral returned to the BHED office to
follow-up the payment of his deliveries.  He asked Buccat for the DRs and TSs covering the last half of his
deliveries.  Buccat was reluctant to
sign the DRs and TSs because he had not witnessed some of the deliveries.  When Del Moral told Buccat that Fonacier and
Sarmiento had seen the deliveries, Buccat said, "<u>Sigue</u>."
Forthwith Buccat prepared the DRs and TSs along with Sarmiento and Fonacier.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the property section, Villanueva signed the DRs and TSs for
the last half of the deliveries and thereafter prepared the second GV.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Del Moral got his copy of the signed DRs and TSs which he later gave to his
sister for safekeeping.  Villanueva also
signed the Report of Inspection<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a> for
the second GV with his note that the original copy of the PO had been attached
to the first GV (dated 15 May 1978).  He
got a duplicate of the original PO and attached it to the second GV.  Since the two GVs were already prepared,
Villanueva did not see any need to consolidate them.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the two GVs reached the accounting section, Gacad asked for
the supporting DRs. Del Moral got the DRs from a brown envelope but Gacad
merely glanced at them.  Del Moral told
Gacad that he was in a hurry to get the payment for the deliveries because
Paragas, who was almost always out on field inspections, was again about to
leave.  Thus, Gacad initialed the two
GVs and Del Moral handcarried them to the ICU where Carantes stamped a list<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
of the documents submitted at its dorsal side and then crosschecked it with the
attached supporting papers.  Carantes
then placed the word "Del" after seeing the DRs.  When the documents reached administrative
officer Ismael, he checked at random the DRs attached to the two GVs.  His initials on the GVs were to indicate
that all the supporting papers had been duly attached and included.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since Garcia, the assistant district engineer, was not around,
Del Moral directly proceeded to Paragas.  The latter inquired why the first GV was not signed by the assistant
district engineer.  Paragas directed his
secretary to first have the GV signed by Garcia.  When his secretary could not find Garcia, Paragas signed the GV
after reviewing all its supporting documents.  In the afternoon, Del Moral brought the second GV to Paragas for his
signature.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the Auditor's Office, the first GV was recorded and assigned a
number by a clerk before it was handed over to COA examiner Remedios
Almoite.  Almoite first checked whether
the GV bore the signatures of the concerned officials.  She crosschecked the attached documents with
the "stamped list" prepared by Carantes paying particular attention
to the report of inspection.  She then
made her own computations<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> on
the volume of materials delivered.  She
also placed a red "x" mark on the stamped list of documents at the
dorsal side of the GV to indicate that she had crosschecked the supporting
papers.  She examined the DRs and the
TSs at random.  When she noticed that
the certificate of test was not attached, she made a note on a one-fourth
coupon bond that it should be attached.  She also informed Del Moral that the certificate of test, a vital
supporting paper, was lacking.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When Del Moral went to the Materials Testing Laboratory to get
the certificate of test, Rogelio Ramos, the supervisor therein, told Joseph
Gonzales to prepare the certificate.  Gonzales prepared two certificates of test<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
and signed the space provided for "Materialman." Ramos then likewise
signed the certificates.  Although there
were nineteen (19) sieve analysis tests conducted by Gonzales, only two results<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
were attached since the results of the other tests proved to be the same.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Del Moral went back to the auditor's office and handed the
certificates to Almoite.  When she
called Villanueva's attention that only 2,775 cu. m. of Item 108 was indicated
on the GV, he said that another GV would be coming in the afternoon.  Almoite then processed the first GV and
brought it to Padilla, who, before affixing his signature, examined the other
signatures already affixed, verified the supporting documents, checked the list
of documents attached and reviewed the computations made by Almoite.  Padilla did not see Del Moral since it was
his policy not to allow contractors to follow-up their papers with him.  In the afternoon, the second GV was
processed by Almoite.</p>

<p class="BODY">While Nabus, cashier I at the BHED, was examining the first GV,
he noticed that assistant district engineer Garcia had yet to affix his
signature.  He told administrative
officer Ismael about this fact but the latter told Nabus that Garcia's
signature was merely "recommendatory" and that the approval of the GV
was evidenced by Paragas' signature.  Thus, Nabus instructed a clerk to prepare the check<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
but he did not sign it because the amount involved was more than
P50,000.00.  Del Moral then brought the
check to the Accounting Section, ICU, Ismael, Paragas, Padilla <span style="">and</span><span style=""> </span>then back to Nabus for its release.  Nabus processed the second GV and issued the corresponding check<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
in the afternoon of the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some time after 26 May 1978, Buccat approached Del Moral for a
loan ("<u>utang</u>") of P2,000.00.  Del Moral construed the "<u>utang</u>" to be a "<u>balato</u>"
and gave Buccat P500.00.  After Buccat
said, "never mind," Del Moral explained that his profit out of the
project was "very little." Buccat allegedly retorted, "I have
signed without seeing some of the deliveries and that is all you are giving
me." Buccat pushed aside the money offered by Del Moral and said,
"Let us see what will happen.  After all there is nothing more to be done."</p>

<p class="BODY">The telegram from Minister Aquino stopping the asphalting of the
Halsema Highway received by Director Manalo in June 1978 was the result of the
request made by Governor Palispis to President Marcos to instead have the
highway concreted.  According to
Governor Palispis, in July 1978 Jose Dominguez showed him an envelope
containing several documents.  The first
sheet of paper signed by Dominguez referred to anomalies at the Halsema
Highway, and Dominguez suggested that the governor should talk to Paragas about
the matter.  At the governor's
suggestion, Dominguez scribbled some notes which meant:  Firstly, that Paragas should be transferred,
otherwise Dominguez would initiate a case against Paragas; secondly, the
"foolishness" with respect to the awards of the BHED projects should
be stopped after intimating to the governor that he should have been declared
the winning bidder of the Halsema Highway project; and thirdly, the governor
himself, Cosalan, Dominguez and Caoile should be given quotas for every project
of the BHED, adding that no contracts should be given to
"lowlanders." Dominguez indicated 29 August 1978 to be the date when
Paragas should give his decision on the matter or else Dominguez would file the
case.  The governor "okayed"
the requests.</p>

<p class="BODY">After about a week, Dominguez called up the governor reminding
him that he should talk to Paragas.  A
few days thereafter, Dominguez again called up the governor on the matter but
the latter told him that he had not yet been able to talk to Paragas.  After about the third week, Dominguez sent a
telegram to the governor giving the latter an ultimatum.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the governor had not acquiesced to the demands of Dominguez, the latter
told him, "You are challenging me." To that, the governor replied,
"You file the case."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When Fonacier learned that the DRs were missing, he confronted
Buccat and asked him if he had them.  Buccat said, "I'll see." Fonacier construed Buccat's answer to
mean that he (Buccat) took the DRs.  Thus, Fonacier instructed Buccat to produce the receipts.  In October 1978, Fonacier told Del Moral
that the project was questioned because of the missing DRs.  Del Moral told Fonacier that he left the DRs
at the BHED office.</p>

<p class="BODY">NBI agent Villar examined the GVs.  Seeing that the DRs and the TSs were not attached to the GVs, he
instructed his personnel to locate the documents.  The search, however, proved futile.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;"><u>Findings</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Sandiganbayan</u></p>

<p class="BODY">In its questioned decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
promulgated on 28 December 1979, the Sandiganbayan gave more credence and
weight to the evidence presented by the prosecution than that given by the
defense which it described to be "bogged down in a quagmire of
contradictions and enmeshed in a web of fabrications.â<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
In sum, it concluded:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.  There was no
"regular or legitimate program of work" in accordance with standard
operating procedures for Item 108.  The
Sandiganbayan said:</p>

<blockquote>"What actually appears from the evidence on record is that,
after the discarding of the first program of work and while the revised program
of work was still pending approval by the MPH (in fact it was approved only in
January, 1979 according to Regional Director Manalo), the accused district
officials took it upon themselves to âresurrectâ the discarded program of work
by lifting that portion of the revised program of work referring to Phase II
and implementing it separately without waiting for the approval of the entire
program.  Such a machination is clearly
apparent by comparing the Phase II portions of the revised program of work
(Exhs. 1-a-Paragas and 1-d-Paragas) and the Detailed Estimates for Phase II
signed by Buccat and Fonacier which is attached to the RSE (Exh. C-8).  And assuming, <u>arguendo</u>, that the
Detailed Estimate and Time Spot Schedules (Exhs. C-8 to C-9) were originally
prepared by Buccat and Fonacier, yet there is no showing that the same
constitute or form part of an approved program of work, involving as they do an
estimated amount of P270,500.00 obligated by Acting Accountant Remedios Gacad,
hence, such program, if it can be called that, must be approved by the regional
office.  Moreover, Regional Director
Manalo could not legally approve such a program involving Phase II as he
himself admitted that a revised program of work for the entire project covering
Phases I to IV and involving P10,000,000.00 had been forwarded already to the
MPH for approval, so that such a piece-meal program of work must have to be
discarded."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.  Director Manalo could
not have approved a requisition for Item 108, Phase II, between 20 April 1978
(Exhs. C-10 and D-2) and 22 May 1978 (Exh. D-2-a) for being in violation of the
COA circular (Exh. I) against "splitting" and of his own revised
program of work.  Furthermore, it would
have entailed the implementation of Phase II much ahead of Phase I which was
not yet completed at the time.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.  Buccat did not witness
the deliveries of the supposed 5,550 cu. m. of road materials covered by Item
108 in May 1978, nor did he prepare the corresponding DRs and the TSs he was
directed to accomplish.  Buccat was, <span style="">in </span>fact, busy at the time supervising
elsewhere the asphalting project of Kms. 257-262.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. There could not have been deliveries of 5,550 cu. m. of Item
108.  Del Moral's testimony that he
started the deliveries at 3:00 in the afternoon of 28 April 1978, the date of
the bidding, and that he alerted and mobilized his truck drivers two days
earlier, strained credulity.  Even
Fonacier, Sarmiento and Gonzales could not testify with certainty that, between
28 April and 23 May 1978, BHED representatives were at the site to witness and
record all such alleged deliveries.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The supposed 28 April 1978 bidding was not merely irregular but
it was "fixed or pre-arranged." The bidding originally scheduled for
31 March 1978 was a "general" bidding aimed primarily at securing a
price index or quotations for future requisitions.  The defense failed to explain satisfactorily "why the
advertised bidding for 31 March 1978 was cancelled or why the notices of
postponement thereof were received by some contractors-suppliers on 26 April
1978 (Exh. 1-Del Moral) when all the supposed âsealedâ proposals were dated 17
April 1978" (Exhs. D-7-a, D-8 to D-13, inclusive).  The Sandiganbayan added:</p>

<blockquote>"Apparently, the bidding previously scheduled on March 31,
1978 was for the purpose of filling up the expected requisitions for the first
program of work prepared by Buccat and which was not approved by the regional
office.  Thereafter, the district
officials, in their inordinate haste to defraud the government, decided to
revive a portion of said discarded program of work referring to kms. 271-276
and seized upon the quotations given as early as April 17, 1978 to commence the
procurement process, as shown by the preparation of an RSE on April 20, 1978,
holding a supposed bidding on April 28, 1978, preparing a GV on <u><span style="">May</span></u><span style=""> <u>15,</u> <u>1978</u> </span>and having the RSE approved by the
regional office only on <u><span style="">May</span></u><span style=""> <u>22,</u> <u>1978</u> </span>and,
thereafter splitting the RSE and PO into two, after which processing and
pre-auditing was railroaded with clock-like precision within the district
office."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">6.  While Paragas claimed
that Del Moral, a winning bidder, was allowed to deliver Item 108, he, however,
admitted in the same vein that Anitos Construction, winning bidder for Items 200,
300, 306-1 and 405, did not deliver said items since the implementation of the
project was stopped.</p>

<p class="NUM">7.  On Almoite's testimony
that no certificate of test was attached to the GV when it was presented to
her, the Sandiganbayan said:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  If such was
the case, then Villanueva, Fonacier, Paragas, Gacad and Carantes, should have
noticed this deficiency as they signed or initialed the GVs ahead of Almoite
and Padilla, and therefore, their claims that they passed the GVs because the
supporting papers were complete miserably fail of their own accord.  Del Moral also admitted this particular
facet of the processing by Almoite and was also corroborated by Ramos and
Gonzales, when the latter two admitted that Del Moral came to them only on May
25, 1978 to get the certificate of test because Almoite was asking for it,
hence, Gonzales prepared the certificate of test that same date (Exhs. C-4, and
D-5) and had it signed by Ramos who gave it to Del Moral for delivery to
Almoite.  Under these circumstances,
then the Court must also reject outright the testimonies of Gonzales and Ramos
to the effect that samples were taken by the former at the job site on April
30, 1978 and five more times in May, 1978, that he made the necessary
laboratory tests on said samples and made written reports to Ramos on each
occasion and that Ramos also submitted written reports to Fonacier, which
testimonies the Court finds to be patently fabricated and perjured.  If such taking of samples, performance of
laboratory tests, and making of reports were actually made, then these reports
would have been attached to the GVs or in the possession of Fonacier, Paragas
or Villanueva, and the certificate of test would not have to be hastily
prepared on May 25, 1978.  As Mr.
Justice Fernandez himself observed during the trial, the certificate of test
showed only one laboratory test conducted (BBR-15a-78) although Gonzales
claimed that he took samples and tested them on six occasions in the month of
May, 1978."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">8. The Item 108 transaction was in violation of the provision of
COA Circular No. 76-41, dated 30 July 1976,<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
against "splitting" of the RSE, POs and GVs.  At P18.00 per cu. m., the 5,550 cu. m. of
Item 108 would have been purchased at P99,900.00.  Thus, the check(s) in payment of the item delivered would have
been in excess of P50,000.00 and therefore would have required the voucher to
be processed, pre-audited and approved by the regional highway auditor, instead
of by merely the BHED auditor, in accordance with COA Circular No. 76-16 of 10
February 1976.  Evidently, in order to
avoid action, review or approval by the regional highway auditor on a check of
P99,900.00, the <span style="">RSE, </span><span style="">PO </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">GV </span>were split
into two.  It was feared that the
regional auditor would "discover that there (were) (1) no regular
biddings, (2) no deliveries of materials, <span style="">(3)
</span>no actual inspection at the job site, and (4) no actual tests
conducted."</p>

<p class="NUM">9. Relative to the alleged selfish motives of Jose Dominguez, the
Sandiganbayan said, "the very evidence of the defense strongly tends to
show that desperate measures were even resorted to by Paragas and Padilla to
seek an amicable settlement with Dominguez, in the process utilizing Governor
Ben Palispis and Assemblyman Antonio Villar to intercede for them.  Gov. Palispis' testimony, in fact,
boomeranged against the defense since by the very nature thereof it is clear
and patent that his intercession was not intended to promote the ends of
justice but to subvert them, even going to the extent of trying to persuade
Dominguez to delay, if not interfere with, the preliminary investigation then
pending in the Benguet Provincial Fiscal's Office."<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></p>

nine (9) of the accused who acted in conspiracy to defraud the Government

tax on the amount of P99,999.00, through the utilization of fictitious and/or

there is an affirmation of the ruling of this Court in Aquino Jr. v. Commission

law-making authority by the President during the period of Martial Law, * * *.'

"shall continue to function and exercise its powers as now or hereafter
may be provided by law, except those conferred on the Office of the Ombudsman

of the Special Prosecutor "shall exercise powers presently exercised by
the Tanodbayan except those conferred on the Office of the Ombudsman under the

ruled, and might now reiterate, that -</p>

<blockquote>"1.  Death of the accused pending appeal of his
conviction extinguishes his criminal liability as well as the civil liability
based solely thereon.  As opined by
Justice Regalado, in this regard, 'the death of the accused prior to final
judgment terminates his criminal liability and <u>only</u> the civil liability <u><span style="">directly</span></u><span style=""> </span>arising from and based solely on the offense committed, i.e.,
civil liability ex delicto in senso strictiore.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.  Corollarily, the claim for civil liability
survives notwithstanding the death of accused, if the same may also be
predicated on a source of obligation other than delict.  Article 1157 of the Civil Code enumerates
these other sources of obligation from which the civil liability may arise as a
result of the same act or omission:</blockquote>

<blockquote>âc) Quasi-contracts</blockquote>

<blockquote>âd) x x x</blockquote>

explained in Number 2 above, an action for recovery therefor may be pursued but
only by way of filing a separate civil action and subject to Section 1, Rule
111 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure as amended.  This separate civil action may be enforced
either against the executor/administrator or the estate of the accused,
depending on the source of obligation upon which the same is based as explained
above.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.   Finally, the private offended party need not
fear a forfeiture of his right to file this separate civil action by
prescription, in cases where during the prosecution of the criminal action and
prior to its extinction, the private-offended party instituted together
therewith the civil action.  In such
case, the statute of limitations on the civil liability is deemed interrupted
during the pendency of the criminal case, conformably with provisions of
Article 1155 of the Civil Code, that should thereby avoid any apprehension on a
possible privation of right by prescription."</blockquote>

other concessions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The elements of the offense defined in
this provision are that:  (1) The
accused is a public officer discharging administrative, judicial or official
functions; (2) he must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith,
or inexcusable negligence; and (3) his action has caused any undue injury to
any party, including the Government, or has given any party any unwarranted
benefit, advantage or preference in the discharge of his functions.<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case at bench, it is undisputed that herein remaining
petitioners are public officers with whom private contractor Del Moral, now
deceased, has been charged also as a co-principal.<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a>
The first element required for the commission of the offense charged is thus
clearly extant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second element enumerates the different modes by which means
the offense penalized in Section 3(e) may be committed.  "Partiality" is synonymous with
"bias"<a style="" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></span></span></a>
which "excites a disposition to see and report matters <span style="">as </span>they are wished for rather than as
they are.â<a style="" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></span></span></a>
"Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence; it imputes
a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of <span style="">a </span>wrong; a breach of sworn duty
through some motive or intent or ill will; it partakes of the nature of
fraud."<a style="" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></span></span></a>
"Gross negligence has been so defined as negligence characterized by the
want of even slight care, acting or omitting to act in a situation where there
is a duty to act, not inadvertently but wilfully and intentionally with a
conscious indifference to consequences in so far <span style="">as </span>other persons may be affected.  It is the omission of that care which even inattentive and
thoughtless men never fail to take on their own property.â<a style="" href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></span></span></a>
These definitions prove all too well that the three modes art distinct and
different from each other.  Proof of the
existence of <u><span style="">any</span></u><span style=""> </span>of these modes in connection with the
prohibited acts under Section 3(e) should suffice to warrant conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The use of the three phrases "manifest partiality,"
"evident bad faith" and "gross inexcusable negligence" in
the same information does not mean that the indictment charges three distinct
offenses<a style="" href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></span></span></a>
but only implies that the offense charged may have been committed through any
of the modes provided by the law.  In
Criminal Case No. 010, all three modes of committing the offense under Section
3(e) are alleged in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third element of the offense is satisfied when the questioned
conduct causes undue injury to any party, including the government, or gives
any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference.  Proof of the extent or <u>quantum</u> of damage is not thus
essential; it should be sufficient that the injury suffered or benefit received
can be perceived to be substantial enough and not merely negligible.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have examined the voluminous records of the cases at bench,
and we cannot decry the findings and conclusions of the Sandiganbayan to be
bereft of factual bases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, except for Del Moral who was charged a co-principal,
were all public officials and alleged to have acted as such in the commission
of the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the testimony of Director Eugenio Manalo of Region I of the
then Ministry of Public Highways, projects undertaken by the BHED would undergo
the following procedures, briefly narrated by the Sandiganbayan thusly:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  Projects
within the region were prosecuted after the Ministry issued subÂ­-advices of
allotments (SAA) to the region which in turn releases letters of advice of
allotments (LAA) to the districts based on allocations and programs of work for
specific projects prepared by the district engineers.  If below P100,000.00, said programs of work can be signed by the
district engineer, and above that amount, they are referred to the regional
director who can approve them up to the amount of P300,000.00.  Beyond the latter amount, the approval of
the Minister of Public Highways must be secured.  After the preparation of the program of work and its approval by
the regional office, it is returned to the district office for execution.  A Requisition for Supplies or Equipment (or
RSE) <span style="">is </span>prepared by the project
engineer and approved by the regional director regardless of the amount, after
which it <span style="">is </span>returned to the
district engineer for implementation.  The procurement of materials is then made by advertisement or
canvass.  If the amount to be
requisitioned is more than P5,000.00, there must be an advertisement for public
bidding, but if the requisition is P5,000.00 and below, canvass may be made for
bidders' proposals.  In case of
newspaper advertisement or publication, the same must be made three times in
newspapers of general circulation in the province or city and posted on
bulletin boards in three public places.  When the bids are submitted on the day of the bidding, the Committee on
Bids and Award in each district makes the award to the supplier on the basis of
the lowest bid.  A Purchase Order (or
PO) is prepared stating the period to deliver and other conditions and is
signed by the winning bidder or supplier.  The supplier then starts delivering the requisitioned materials and
notifies the district engineer or project engineer, as well as the auditor, of
the start of deliveries so that the same may be checked.  Delivery receipts (DRs) in four or five
copies are usually signed by the resident engineer together with the tally sheets
(TSs) which contain a summary of the deliveries.  Upon the completion of the deliveries, the supplier demands
payment.  The DRs, TSs, the Certificate
of Testing, RSE, SWA, abstract and <u>program</u> <u>of</u> <u>work</u> are
then attached to the general vouchers (GVs) which are prepared for the
collection of payments due to the supplier.  The GVs and supporting papers are processed as to funding and deliveries
and pre-audited by the auditor's office, after which the corresponding checks
are prepared by the cashier, signed by the district engineer, and countersigned
by the auditor."<a style="" href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Halsema Highway project was initiated upon the verbal
directive of then President Marcos to the then Minister of Public Highways
Baltazar Aquino in the presence of Regional Director Eugenio Manalo.  Minister Aquino, in turn, directed
petitioner Paragas, then Highway District Engineer of the locality, to prepare
a program of work.  The one prepared by
the BHED for asphalting the Halsema Highway, however, was disapproved due to
the request of Governor Ben Palispis that "concrete" should instead
be used for the project.  Hence, the
Regional Office itself, through engineers Purugganan and Collado, prepared the
PW.  Project engineer Fonacier brought
the PW to the Regional Office for approval.  Considering that the total allocation of P10,000,000.00 for the whole
project, exceeded the jurisdictional limit set for approval merely by the
Regional Director, the PW was transmitted to Minister Aquino.  It was finally approved by Minister Aquino
only in January 1979 or eight months after contractor Del Moral had supposedly
delivered Item 108 at the jobsite.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Paragas, they proceeded with the "public
bidding" for the materials required for the project because the copy of
the PW, still unsigned by the Regional Director but which Fonacier retained,
"was the basis of the preparation of the RIV or RSE.â<a style="" href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></span></span></a>
Paragas claimed that they relied upon the verbal instruction of Minister Aquino
to proceed with the implementation of the project because it was an
"emergency" case.<a style="" href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></span></span></a>
Although he knew that the PW was yet to be approved, Paragas scheduled,
nevertheless, the holding of a public bidding upon learning that the funds for
the project were already made available.<a style="" href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></span></span></a> He
directed Assistant District Engineer Felimon Garcia to cause the publication of
a notice of a general bidding for the supply of materials which did not
indicate any quantity or volume thereof<a style="" href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></span></span></a>
considering that the PW was yet pending approval by the <u>Regional</u> <u>Director</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></span></span></a>
The items were also not detailed on the excuse that the itemization of the
materials needed would "involve great space for publication."<a style="" href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[78]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead of the required three publications, the notice for public bidding
scheduled for 28 to 31 March was published only twice in the Midland Courier, a
newspaper in Baguio City, on 19 March and 26 March of 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the BHED administrative officer, Cipriano G. Ismael,
he gave invitations to bid to interested bidders.  Del Moral was first informed of the reset bidding because he was
the first to come to the office to get a copy of the invitation to bid.<a style="" href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></span></span></a>
Del Moral talked to Ismael and Fonacier to know what materials would still be
bidded but he did not bother to ask Fonacier on the quantity of materials
needed because he was "sure of winning the bidding.â<a style="" href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[80]</sup></span></span></a>
Ordinarily, bidders were required to post bonds but Garcia could not remember
if Del Moral submitted a bidder's bond.<a style="" href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[81]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the reset bidding on 28 April 1979, Del Moral emerged the
winning bidder for Item 108 having placed a bid of P18.00 per cu. m.<a style="" href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[82]</sup></span></span></a>
In the abstract of bids, Garcia annotated "Recommended as to Item 108
only" because "all the other items were priced too high."<a style="" href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[83]</sup></span></span></a>
Once he knew that he had won the bid for Item 108, Del Moral supposedly
instructed his drivers to make the deliveries of Item 108 at the jobsite.  Deliveries were said to have started in the
afternoon of April 28 even though no purchase order had yet been issued.<a style="" href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[84]</sup></span></span></a>
The purchase order for 5,550 cu. m. of Item 108 at P18 per cu. m. for the total
amount of P99,900.00 bore the date 02 May 1979.<a style="" href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[85]</sup></span></span></a>
Property custodian Francisco M. Villanueva, Jr., admitted having signed the
purchase order only on 25 May 1979<a style="" href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[86]</sup></span></span></a>
although on the face of the original copy of the purchase order, Exh. D-4, his
signature clearly appeared with the notations "<u>5/15/75</u>" and
"2,775 cu. m. partial."</p>

<p class="BODY">The deliveries were reportedly checked by Arnulfo Sarmiento, the
auditing office representative.  Ruben
Buccat, the resident engineer designated by Paragas for the project, upon the
other hand, denied that there were such deliveries although he admitted having
prepared some DRs and TSs only upon the persistent prodding of project engineer
Fonacier.  He swore that he had prepared
not more than 10% of the DRs which he also tore up to pieces upon learning that
the materials said to have been delivered had already been paid for.  Del Moral presented to the processors of the
vouchers what appeared to be bundles of delivery receipts but later admitted
that there were <u>blank</u> <u><span style="">forms</span></u><span style=""> </span>in the DRs he submitted for
examination,<a style="" href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[87]</sup></span></span></a>
lamely explaining that whoever prepared them did not press hard enough the
ballpen used in filling them up or that no carbon paper was placed between the
copies.<a style="" href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[88]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">No report was prepared on whether the materials met the standards
set therefor and no certificate of test was accomplished until after the
absence of that vital document was discovered by auditing examiner Remedios
Almoite.  That a certificate of test was
eventually submitted did not diminish the negligence of Ramos; on the contrary,
its belated submission compounded his complicity.  For his part, Fonacier also proved to have been recalcitrant to
his duty by failing to verify that the materials delivered were not only <u>quantitatively</u>
but also <u>qualitatively</u> in accordance with the specifications set for the
project.</p>

<p class="BODY">Del Moral himself admitted that he requested for
"partial" payment from Fonacier "in the middle of May."<a style="" href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[89]</sup></span></span></a>
The property custodian, Villanueva, prepared and signed the voucher without
having seen the actual deliveries but merely relied on the signature of
Fonacier thereon and the dubious DRs and TSs presented by Del Moral.<a style="" href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[90]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Auditor Padilla can hardly profess ignorance of Commission on
Audit Circular No. 76-41, dated 30 July 1976,<a style="" href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[91]</sup></span></span></a>
prohibiting the splitting of requisitions, purchase orders, vouchers and the
like.  "Splitting" has been
defined to mean -</p>

<blockquote>"x x x dividing or breaking up into separate parts or
portions, or an act resulting in a fissure, rupture, breach.  Within the sphere of government procurement,
<u>splitting</u> <u>is</u> <u>associated</u> <u><span style="">with</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>requisitions,</u>
<u>purchase</u> <u>orders,</u> <u>deliveries</u> <u>and</u> <u>payments</u>."
(Underscoring supplied.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">"Splitting of payments,"
likewise prohibited, arises when "two or more payments for one or <span style="">more </span>items involving one purchase
order" are made in order to "avoid inspection of deliveries; <span style="">x x x </span>avoid <span style="">x x x </span>action, review or approval by higher authorities; (or) x x

<p class="BODY">Auditor Padilla asseverated that when the vouchers reached him
after it had been pre-audited by Remedios Almoite, he only "took a cursory
examination" of the signatures thereon, "verified the supporting
documents attached" and saw the list of documents attached, as well as the
computation made by the auditing examiner.<a style="" href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[93]</sup></span></span></a> If
indeed, however, he verified the documents attached to the vouchers, he could
not have escaped noticing that the quantity of Item 108 indicated in the
attached purchase order, Exh. D-4, was for 5,550 cu. m.  Ordinary diligence and a working knowledge
of the pertinent COA circulars, specifically Circular No. 76-41, expected of
someone in his position, would have sounded a warning bell upon Padilla before
affixing his signature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another circular which Padilla had grossly overlooked was COA
Circular No. 76-16A, dated 23 March 1976, "clarifying COA Circular No.
76-16, dated 10 February 1976, on the limitation for the countersignature by
different officials of the Commission on Audit." Hence -</p>

<blockquote>"1)  Resident Auditors of bureaus, offices and
agencies of the National Government in Metropolitan Manila, as well as other
Auditors for District/City Highway, Public Works/School, State Colleges and
Universities, Military Areas and Zones outside Metropolitan Manila, are
authorized to countersign checks and warrants in amounts not exceeding
P50,000.00 in each case.  This revokes
the previous Orders issued to some Resident Auditors and to Highway, District,
City and other Auditors authorizing them to countersign treasury warrants and
checks in excess of P50,000.00 and/or without limit."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The checks issued in favor of Del Moral, i.e., PNB Checks No. SN
4-6394572 and No. SN 4-6394573, each for P48,451.50 bearing the signatures of
both Paragas and Padilla bore the date 26 May 1979.<a style="" href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[94]</sup></span></span></a>
Granting that Padilla failed to notice that the quantity of the materials
delivered indicated on the PO was clearly halved by Villanueva and that he also
missed seeing the two vouchers to be supported by the same set of documents,
the issuance of two checks indicating amounts close to P50,000.00 each on the
same day to the same person should have easily put him on guard.  Hardly could he thus seek protection under

circulars and closing his eyes to irregularities glaringly indicated on the
documents supporting the two vouchers; and <u>Ramos</u> for the grossly
lackadaisical performance of his duty to see to it that the materials allegedly
delivered were in accordance with government standards.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proof of the extent of damage sustained by the government with
respect to the supposed deliveries of Item 108 is not indispensable for
conviction.  It is enough that Del Moral
has obtained large payments through, using the language of the Sandiganbayan,
"the utilization of fictitious and/or fraudulent public documents <span style="">x x x </span>for a non-existing project <span style="">x x x </span>and non-existing
deliveries."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We, </span>however, find
lack of moral certainty in the conviction of petitioners Remedios Almoite,

knowledge of a conspiracy among their co-accused or of their intentional and
active participation therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[97]</sup></span></span></a>
