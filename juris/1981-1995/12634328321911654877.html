				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This petition for <i>certiorari</i>
involves an issue that has been raised before this Court several times in the
past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, in effect, is
asking for a re-examination of our decisions on the issue of whether or not an
entrustee in a trust receipt agreement who fails to deliver the proceeds of the
sale or to return the goods if not sold to the entruster-bank is liable for the
crime of estafa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Allied Banking Corporation charged Betty Sia Ang with
estafa in Criminal Case No. 87-53501 in <span class="GramE">an information</span>
which alleged:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about July 18, 1980, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused, being then the proprietress of Eckart
Enterprises, a business entity located at 756 Norberto Amoranto Avenue, Quezon
City, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud the
Allied Banking Corporation, a banking institution, represented by its Account
Officer, Raymund S. Li, in the following manner, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the said accused received in trust from the
aforesaid bank Gordon Plastics, plastic sheeting and Hook Chromed, in the total
amount of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P398,000.00, specified <span style="">in a </span>trust receipt and covered by
Domestic Letter of Credit No. DLC?002-801254, under the express
obligation on the part of said accused to sell the same and a<span style="">c</span>count for the proceeds of the sale
thereof, if <span style="">sold, </span>or to return
said merchandise, if not sold, on <span style="">or </span>before
October 16, 1980, <span style="">or </span>upon
demand, but the said accused, once in possession of the said articles, far from
complying with the aforesaid obligation, notwithstanding repeated demands made
upon her to that effect, paid only the amount of P283,115.78, thereby leaving
unaccounted for the amount of P114,884.22 which, once in her possession, with
intent to defraud, she misappropriated, misapplied and converted to her own
personal use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of said Allied Banking
Corporation in the aforesaid sum of P114,884.22, Philippine Currency."
(Rollo, pp. 13-14)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused filed a motion to quash the information on the ground
that the facts charged <span style="">do </span>not
constitute an offense.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1988</st1:date>,
the respondent judge granted the motion to quash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order was anchored on the premise that a<span style=""> </span>trust receipt transaction is an
evidence of a loan being secured so that there is, as between the parties to
it, a creditor-debtor relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
court ruled that the penal clause of Presidential Decree No. 115 on the Trust
Receipts Law is inoperative because it does not actually punish an offense <u>mala</u>
<u>prohibita</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law only refers to
the relevant estafa provision in the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court relied on the judicial
pronouncements in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Cuevo</u>, 104 SCRA 312 [1981]
where, for lack of the required number of votes, this Court upheld the
dismissal of a charge for estafa for a violation of a trust receipt agreement;
and in <u>Sia</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="GramE"><u><span style="">People</span></u><span style="">, </span>121
SCRA 655 [1983] where we held that the violation merely gives rise to a civil
obligation.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time the order
to quash was issued or on <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="1">January 7,
 1988</st1:date>, these two decisions were the only most recent ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The private respondent
adopted practically the same </span>stance of the lower <span style="">court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>She likewise
asserts that P.D. 115 is unconstitutional as it violates the constitutional
prohibition against imprisonment for non-payment of a debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She argues that where no malice exists in a
breach of a purely commercial undertaking, P.D. 115 imputes it.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court notes that the petitioner bank brought a similar case
before this Court in G.R. No. 82495, entitled <u>Allied</u> <u>Banking</u> <u>Corporation</u>
<u>v.</u> <u>Hon.</u> <u>Secretary</u> <u>Sedfrey</u> <u>Ordoñez</u> <u>and</u>
<u>Alfredo</u> <u>Ching</u> which we decided on December 10, 1990 (192 SCRA
246).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the petitioner
additionally questioned, and we accordingly reversed, the <span style="">pronouncement </span>of the Secretary of
Justice limiting the application of the penal provision of P.D. 115 only to
goods intended to be sold to the exclusion of those still to be manufactured.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As in G.R. No. 82495, we resolve the instant petition <span style="">i</span>n the light of the Court's ruling in <u>Lee</u>
<u>v.</u> <u>Rodil</u>, 175 SCRA 100 [1989] and <u>Sia</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>, 166 SCRA 263 [1988].<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have held <span style="">in </span>the latter
cases that acts involving the violation of <span style="">t</span>rust receipt agreements occuring after <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="1">29 January 1973</st1:date> (date <span style="">of </span>enactment of P.D. 115) would make the accused criminally
liable for estafa under paragraph 1 (b), Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code
(RPC) pursuant to the explicit provision in Section 13 of P.D. 115.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant penal provision of P.D. 115 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13 of P.D. No. 115 provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> Penalty clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The failure of an entrustee to turn over
the proceeds of the sale of the goods, documents <span style="">or </span>instruments covered by a trust receipt to the extent of the
amount owing to the entruster or as appears in the trust receipt<span style=""> </span>or to return said goods, documents or
instruments if they were not sold or disposed of in accordance with the terms
of the trust receipt shall constitute the crime <span style="">of </span>estafa, punishable under the provisions of Article Three
Hundred and Fifteen, paragraph one (b) of Act Numbered Three Thousand Eight
Hundred and Fifteen, as amended, otherwise known as the Revised Penal
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the violation or offense is
committed <span style="">by </span>a corporation,
partnership, association or other juridical entities, the penalty provided for
in this Decree shall be imposed upon the directors, officers, employees or
other officials <span style="">or </span>persons
therein responsible for the offense, without prejudice to the civil liabilities
arising from the criminal offense.”<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 (b), Article 315 of the RPC under which the violation
is made to fall, states:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> Swindling (estafa).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any person who shall defraud <span style="">a</span>nother by any <span style="">of t</span>he means mentioned herein below x x x:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="font-size: 3pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"b<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By</span> misappropriating or converting, to the prejudice of another,
money, goods, or any other personal property received by the offender in trust
or on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation
involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the same, even though such
obligation be totally or partially guaranteed by a bond; or by denying having
received such money, goods, or other property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The factual circumstances in the present case show that the
alleged violation was committed sometime in 1980 or during the effectivity of
P.D. 115.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure, therefore, to
account <span style="">for </span>the P114<span class="GramE">,884.22</span> balance is what makes the accused-respondent
criminally liable for estafa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
reiterates its definitive ruling that, in the <u>Cuevo</u> and <u>Sia</u>
(1983) cases relied upon by the <span class="GramE">accused,</span> P.D. 115 was
not applied because the questioned acts were committed before its
effectivity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lee <span style="">v. </span>Rodil, <u>supra</u>, p. 108) At the
time those cases were decided, the failure to comply with the obligations under
the trust receipt was susceptible to two interpretations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court in <u>Sia</u> adopted the view that
a violation gives rise only to a civil liability as the more feasible view
"before the promulgation of P.D. 115," notwithstanding prior
decisions where we ruled that a breach also gives rise to a liability for
estafa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. Yu
Chai Ho, 53 Phil. 874 [1929]; Samo v.</span> <span class="GramE">People, 115
Phil. 346 [1962]; Philippine National Bank v. Arrozal, 103 Phil. 213 [1958];
Philippine National Bank v. Viuda e <span style="">Hijos
</span>de Angel Jose, 63 Phil. 814 [1936]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the reasoning of the respondent court and the
accused, a trust receipt arrangement does not involve a simple loan transaction
between a creditor and a debtor-importer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apart from a loan feature, the trust receipt arrangement has a security
feature that is covered by the trust receipt itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Vintola v. Insular Bank of Asia and America,
151 SCRA 578 [1987]) That second feature is what provides the much needed
financial assistance to our traders in the importation or purchase of goods or
merchandise through the use of those goods or merchandise as collateral for the
advancements made by a bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">(Samo </span>v.</span> <span class="GramE">People, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The title of the bank to
the security is the one sought to be protected and not the loan which is a
separate and distinct agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trust Receipts Law punishes the dishonesty and abuse of confidence
in the handling of money or goods to the prejudice of another regardless of
whether the latter is the owner or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law does not seek to enforce payment of the loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there can be no <span style="">violation of a right against imprisonment for non-payment of a debt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Trust receipts are indispensable contracts in international and
domestic business transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prevalent use of trust receipts, the danger of their misuse and/or
misappropriation of the goods or proceeds realized from the sale of goods, documents
or instruments held <u>in</u> <u><span style="">trust</span></u><span style=""> </span>for entruster-banks, and the need for
regulation of trust receipt transactions to safeguard the rights and enforce
the obligations of the parties involved are the main thrusts of P.D. 115.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">correctly
observed by the Solicitor General, P.D. 115, </span>like Batas Pambansa Blg.
22, punishes the act “not as an <span style="">offense
against property, but as an offense against </span>public order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x </span>x
x <span class="GramE">The</span> misuse of trust receipts <span style="">therefore should be deterred to prevent any possible </span>havoc <span style="">in </span>trade circles and the banking
community (citing Lozano v. <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>,
146 SCRA 323 [1986]; Rollo, p. 57).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is in the context of upholding public
interest that </span>the law now specifically designates a breach of a trust
receipt agreement to be an act that “shall” make one liable for estafa.</p>

<p class="BODY">The offense is punished as a <u>malum</u> <u>prohibitum</u>
regardless of the existence of intent or malice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere failure to deliver the proceeds of the
sale or the goods if not <span class="GramE">sold,</span> constitutes a criminal
offense that causes prejudice not only to another, but more to the public
interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are continually re-evaluating the opposite view which insists
that the violation of a trust receipt agreement should result only in a civil
action for collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
contends that there is no malice involved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She cites the dissent of the late Chief Justice Claudio Teehankee in <u>Ong</u>
<u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>, (124 SCRA 578 [1983]) to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The old capitalist orientation <span style="">of </span>putting importers <span style="">in </span>jail
for supposed estafa or swindling for non-payment of the price of the imported
goods released to them under trust receipts (a purely commercial transaction)
under the fiction of the trust receipt device, should no longer be permitted in
this day and age."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, however, the <span style="">law </span>punishes the dishonesty and abuse of confidence in the
handling of money or goods to the prejudice of the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court reiterates that
the enactment of P.D. 115 </span>is a valid exercise of the police power of the
State and is, thus, constitutional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Lee
v. Rodil, <u>supra</u>; Lozano v. <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>,
<u>supra</u>) The arguments of the respondent are appropriate for a repeal or
modification <span style="">of </span><span style="">the law and should be directed to
Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But until the law is repealed,
we are constrained to apply </span>it.<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order <span style="">of </span>the respondent Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 52 dated
<st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1988</st1:date> <span style="">is </span>SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let this case be remanded to the said court
