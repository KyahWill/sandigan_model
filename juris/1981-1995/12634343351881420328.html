<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court, the facts as could be gleaned from
the evidence on record, were as follows:</p>

<blockquote>When the accused Nimfa Bodozo was in Luna, La Union, she told the
private complainants, who are simple farmers, and at the time unemployed, that
she was recruiting workers for employment in Saudi Arabia and Singapore.  The accused Nimfa Bodozo required the five
(5) private complainants to submit to her, in addition to their respective
applications, NBI clearances and medical certificates in connection with their
applications.  The private complainants
Prudencio Renon and Fernando Gagtan were told by the accused Nimfa Bodozo that
their salary in Saudi Arabia was US$200.00 a month, while the accused Nimfa
Bodozo assured private complainants, Angelino Obiacoro, Ludovico Gagtan and
Domingo Obiacoro that they were going to be paid, by their respective
employers, in Singapore, the amount of Singapore 16.00 dollars a day.  The private complainants Prudencio Renon and
Fernando Gagtan submitted their application forms, duly filled up, passports,
their NBI clearances and medical certificates to the accused Nimfa Bodozo in
their residence at Quirino Avenue, Manila.  Domingo Obiacoro, Angelino Obiacoro and Ludovico Gagtan likewise
submitted to the accused their NBI clearances and medical certificates as
required by the accused.  Moreover, the
accused demanded from the private complainant Prudencio Renon the amount of
P19,000.00 in connection with his application for employment abroad.  Of the said amount, P15,000.00 was to be
used by the accused as processing fee for the application and papers of the
private complainant for his employment abroad.  Prudencio Renon paid to the accused Nimfa Bodozo, on October 3, 1988,
the amount of P15,000.00 for which the said accused signed a Receipt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

The mother of Prudencio Renon paid the balance of P4,000.00 to the same accused
but the latter did not issue any receipt for said amount.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused Nimfa Bodozo demanded from the private complainant
Fernando Gagtan the amount of P20,000.00 in connection with his application for
employment abroad.  Fernando Gagtan paid
to the accused Nimfa Bodozo, also on October 3, 1988, the amount of P12,000.00
for which the said accused signed and issued Receipts<a style="mso-footnote-id:

the amount of P8,000.00 through Maxima Gagtan the mother of Fernando Gagtan,
for which the accused Nimfa Bodozo issued a Receipt dated April 8,1989.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The accused Nimfa Bodozo
demanded from Domingo Obiacoro the amount of P20,000.00 in </span>connection
with his application for employment abroad.  Of the amount, P10,000.00 will be used for the purchase of a plane
ticket for the private complainant for Singapore and the balance of P10,000.00
was to be used as placement fee for the application of the private complainant
for employment abroad.  Domingo Obiacoro
paid P10,000.00 to the accused Nimfa Bodozo in the house of the friend of the
accused in Luna, La Union but the accused did not issue any Receipt for the
amount at the time.  Domingo Obiacoro
paid the balance of P10,000.00 to the accused Nimfa Bodozo, in the presence of
the accused Joey Bodozo in the house of the accused at President Quirino
Avenue, Manila.  The accused Joey Bodozo
later signed and issued a Receipt for the said amount of P20,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>The accused Joey Bodozo demanded from Angelino Obiacoro the payment
of P20,000.00 in connection with the latter's application for employment
abroad.  Angelino Obiacoro gave to the
accused Joey Bodozo the amount of P10,000.00 in two (2) installments on
different occasion for which the accused Joey Bodozo later signed and issued a
Receipt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>The accused Joey Bodozo likewise demanded from Ludovico Gagtan the
payment of the amount of P20,000.00 in connection with his application for
employment abroad.  Ludovico Gagtan,
through his mother, Maxima Gagtan, gave to the accused Nimfa Bodozo the amount
of P10,000.00 but the latter failed to issue any receipt at that time.  However, considering that the private
complainant did not have the amount of P10,000.00 to pay the balance of the
P20,000.00 demanded by the accused, but the latter offered to advance the
amount for the account of private complainant for which the latter and his
mother, Maxima Gagtan, signed a "Promissory Note" in favor of the
accused Joey Bodozo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
However, the accused added the amount of P4,000.00 to the P10,000.00
purportedly advanced by the accused for the private complainant by way of
interests on said loan.  The accused
Nimfa Bodozo later signed and issued a Receipt<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> for

<p class="BODY">After a careful scrutiny of the evidence, We found no cause to

facts.  In the absence of any
substantial proof that the trial court's decision was grounded entirely on speculations,

- (a) <u>Any recruitment activities</u>, including the prohibited practices
enumerated under Article 34 of this Code, <u>to be undertaken by non-licensees
or  non-holders of authority shall be

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that any of the acts mentioned in Article 13

<blockquote>1.  The offender is a
non-license or non-holder of authority to lawfully engage in the recruitment

<blockquote>2.  That the offender undertakes either any
recruitment activities defined under Article 13(b), or any prohibited practices
enumerated under Article 34 of the Labor Code.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this case at bar, it is undisputed that accused?appellants
Joey Bodozo and Nimfa Bodozo are neither licensed nor authorized to recruit
workers for overseas employment as shown by the certification<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

issued by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants want this Court to believe that they merely
helped private complainants apply for overseas employment.  Evidences on record, however, show
otherwise.  Accused-appellants not only
asked private complainants to fill up application <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">forms </span>but also to submit to them their NBI clearances, passports
and medical certificates.  In addition
thereto, accused-appellants collected payment for processing fee and other
sundry expenses from private complainants, all of which constitutes acts of
recruitment within the meaning of the law.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants point to a certain Belen Hernandez, a manager
of Mogleo International Management and Service Contractor a duly registered and
licensed recruiter, and Jing Evangelista of Ultragen, Inc. as the persons who
were responsible for the recruitment of private complainants.  If such allegations were true, why did
accused-appellants not present any one of them as witness to corroborate their
claim?  For reasons only known to them,
they chose to suppress such testimony as evidence and instead risked the
adverse inference and legal presumption that "evidence wilfully suppressed
would be adverse if produced".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, if it was Belen Hernandez and Jing Evangelista who<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>were the recruiters, why did
accused-appellants issue the receipts<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
acknowledging payments made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span>private
complainants?</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants Nimfa Bodozo alleged that she was forced to
issue and sign receipts marked as<i> </i>Exhibits J and N because private
complainants Prudencio Renon and Fernando Gagtan were mad and refused to leave
the house.  On the other hand,
accused-appellant Joey Bodozo claimed that he, too, was forced to issue and
sign Exhibits L and E at Kalaw Street, Ermita, Manila because private
complainants Angelino Obiacoro and Domingo Obiacoro would kill him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find accused-appellants' alibi not convincing.  Such allegations are self-serving.  No evidence of force was represented by
accused-appellant Nimfa Bodozo to bolster her claim that she was forced except
to state that she was afraid of private complainants' anger.  In the case of accused-appellant Joey
Bodozo, it will be noted that the alleged force happened in a busy public
street.  Neither did the
accused-appellants file any case against private complainants for forcing them
to sign and issue said receipts.  At
most, their claim of force may be said to be merely an afterthought to
exculpiate themselves from the charges levelled against them by private
complainants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, We agree with the findings of the trial court that no
improper motives may be attributed to private complainants to charge
accused-appellants with a serious crime as illegal recruitment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Records show that private complainants are simple farmers,
unemployed and natives of La Union, who see employment abroad as a means to
alleviate their living conditions, only to find out that they have been the
victims of illegal recruiters preying on poor workers.  It has been held that "the absence of
evidence as to an improper motive actuating the principal witnesses of the
prosecution strongly tends to sustain no improper motive existed and their
testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.‚Äù<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, under Article 38 of the Labor Code, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>amended, the crime of illegal
recruitment is qualified when the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
</span>committed against three (3) or more persons, individually or as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>group.  Accused-appellant having committed the crime of illegal

Domingo Obiacoro and Ludovico Gagtan, the penalty of life imprisonment and the
fine of P100,000.00 (Article 39 (a) Labor Code of the Philippines as amended) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>correctly imposed by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of foregoing findings and for reasons indicated, We
