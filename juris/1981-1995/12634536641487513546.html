				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">It was not unexpected, considering
the close family ties so traditional among Filipinos, that the stabbing,
apparently without provocation, of one <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span> by Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Mag-aso</span>, would
be attended with serious, if not tragic, consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It happened on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">September </span>20,

aggressor, attempting to escape, was confronted by two </span>brothers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span>, originally included in the information but now
deceased, and appellant Mario <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attempt of <span class="SpellE">Mag-aso</span>
to board a jeep was unsuccessful, he having alighted after two shots were fired
in succession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Knowing that he was
completely at the mercy of the two brothers, he raised his hands as a sign of
surrender, but they were not to be appeased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was pistol-whipped by appellant Mario <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span>,
being dealt several blows on the head and the face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After he had fallen to the ground, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span> stabbed the deceased on the chest three or four times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was brought to the hospital where he died,
the cause, according to the coroner's report, being "hemorrhagic shock due
to a wound of the heart."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The above facts are not open to dispute, the decision of the
lower court and the briefs for both appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
being substantially in agree­ment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
trial duly held, Mario <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span> was convicted of
murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lower court found that the
crime was committed with evident premeditation and treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lower court also held that appellant took
advantage of his position as a police officer and employed means or brought
about circumstances which added ignominy to the natural effects of his
act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It sentenced him to suffer the
death penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this case is
before this Tribunal for auto­matic review.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The brief for the appellant prays for the reversal of the
judgment and assigns four errors as having been committed by the lower
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

of the qualifying as well as the aggravating circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, the brief imputes as error of the
lower court what it referred to as "discarding the ante mortem statement
of the victim." As will be shown, there is no basis for reversal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment, how­ever, calls for
modification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Murder was committed, the
qualifying circumstance of <span class="SpellE">alevosia</span> being quite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">evident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The aggravating circumstances, however, were not proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the lower court did not take into
consideration the existence of the mitigating circumstance of the immediate
vindication of a grave offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the imposition of the death penalty was not warranted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. The circumstances indicative of the manner by which the two
brothers, as well as their two companions, who apparently were not apprehended
as they were not included in the information, attacked the hapless victim,
would suffice to show conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
apparently had one purpose in mind, to avenge the stabbing of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a reaction, as noted at the outset, is
quite understandable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not to be
expected that they would even bother to inquire why their brother was
stabbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was enough that it was
done.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were impelled by a common
purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They acted in concert.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is sufficient basis for the finding of
conspiracy then.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As far back as <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> v. <span class="SpellE">Magcamot</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1909 decision, Justice <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span> stressed as the
essential element for conspiracy to exist the "concurrence of wills"
and "unity of action and purpose."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
A recent decision is partial to the phrase, "tacit and spontaneous coordination,"
in the assault.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
A careful analysis of the evidence by the lower court can yield no other conclusion
but that conspiracy was duly proved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. From the facts as narrated above, there can <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">be no </span>other conclusion except that the
crime was one of murder, the qualifying circumstance of treachery being
present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The specific language of the
Revised Penal Code calls for application:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes
against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution thereof
which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to
himself arising <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">from the defense which
the offended party might make."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Mag-aso's</span>
situation was hopeless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any defense he
could have put up would be futile and unavailing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His hands were raised in surrender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That notwithstanding, he was
pistol-whipped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When lying prostrate on
the ground, he was stabbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be
remembered that, according to the testi­monial evidence, there were two other
persons assisting the brothers <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If they were not included in the information,
the explanation would appear to be that they managed to elude capture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no risk, therefore, to the
aggressors, no hope for the victim.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> The trial court committed no error then in
appreciating the circumstance of treachery as being present.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The </span>lower court
erred, however, in finding the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation,
of means being employed or circumstances brought about to add ignominy to the

means being employed or circumstances being brought about to add ignominy to
the natural effects of the act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
well to stress that they were prompted by their desire to avenge their
brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They went after <span class="SpellE">Mag-aso</span>, the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They assaulted him, relying on the weapons they carried with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jesus stabbed him and appellant Mario
pistol-whipped him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They did what they
felt they had to do to redress a grievance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be said, therefore, </span>that they deliberately employed
means to add ignominy to the natural effects of the act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is quite apparent that all they were
interested in was to assure that there be retribution for what was done to
their brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that
appellant Mario <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span> is a member of the police
force certainly did not of itself justify that the aggravating circumstance of
advantage being taken by the offender of his public position be considered as
present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He acted like a brother,
instinctively reacting to what was undoubtedly a vicious assault on his kin
that could cause the death of a loved one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It would be an affront to reason to state that at a time like that and
reacting as he did, he purposely relied on his being a policeman to commit the
act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He pistol-whipped the deceased
because he had his pistol with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
came in handy and he acted accordingly.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
That he was a policeman is of no relevance in assessing his criminal
responsibility.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. There is another aspect of the decision that calls for
correction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mitigating circumstance
of immediate vindication of a grave offense was not considered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no ambiguity in the language of the
Revised Penal Code:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"That the act was
committed in the immediate vindication of a grave offense to the one committing
the felony (<span class="SpellE"><u>delito</u></span>), his spouse, ascendants,
descendants, legitimate, natural, or adopted brothers or sisters, or relatives
by affinity within the same degree."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
What was done was an immediate vindication of the stabbing perpetrated by <span class="SpellE">Mag-aso</span> on appellant's brother <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For relatively less serious crimes than this,
this Court has taken into consideration this mitigating circumstance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Certainly it seems probable that the
reason why the lower court failed to do so was the fact that appellant was a
member of the police force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is not
conclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is decisive is the fact
that the brothers <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span>, responsive to what is a
traditional norm of conduct, reacted in a manner which for them was necessary
under the circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>That <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">was a fulfillment of what family honor and
affection require.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aggressor who did
them wrong should not go unpunished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is not to justify what was done.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It offers though an explanation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, the rule of law, which frowns on an individual taking
matters into his own hands, re­quires that every circumstance in favor of an
accused should not be ignored.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is
to render justice according to law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
mitigating circumstance calls for application.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>5. There is no point in discussing the fourth assigned error,
namely, that the ante mortem statement of the victim should have been given
weight by the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such exhibit,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

answers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The answers to the second and
the third questions referred to what happened to <span class="SpellE">Mag-aso</span>
and who was responsible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His answer was
that he was stabbed, and that it was done by Jesus <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other questions dealt with when and where
it happened as well as whether or not he was in possession of his senses, and a
rather unnecessary question as to whether he was aggrieved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court, as was the lower court, is aware
that the stabbing was by Jesus <span class="SpellE">Capalac</span>, not by
appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not thereby mean that
