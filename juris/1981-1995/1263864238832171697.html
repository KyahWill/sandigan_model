				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for prohibition with a prayer for the issuance of
temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction was filed by the
petitioners who are the duly elected city officials of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tangub</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eleno</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Regidor</span> was elected City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Tangub</span>
City, the other petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Siete</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Zapatos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rodulfo</span> Enriquez, are
respectively the Vice-Mayor and members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panglunsod</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tangub</span> City,
who were elected in the January 18, 1988 local elections, were proclaimed in
due course, and assumed office.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 3, 1988, respondents William <span class="SpellE">Chiongbian</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Garcia, <span class="SpellE">Marivic</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sagrado</span>, <span class="SpellE">Morpheus</span> <span class="SpellE">Agot</span>, <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balais</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span> <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, Ernesto Ira, <span class="SpellE">Pacita</span> Yap,
and Julio <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, who are respectively the Provincial
Governor, the Vice-Governor, and members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span>, approved Resolution No. 340-88
recommending the suspension of the petitioners who failed to appear on November
18, 1988 at the hearing of a complaint for unspecified misconduct which
respondent Robert O. <span class="SpellE">Taclob</span> filed against them in the
office of the Governor and the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to that resolution, Governor William <span class="SpellE">Chiongbian</span>
issued on November 24, 1988 an Order of Preventive Suspension, suspending the
petitioners "from their elective positions as City Mayor, City Vice-Mayor
and <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglunsod</span>
members of <span class="SpellE">Tangub</span> City for a period of 60 days
effective November 25, 1988" and ordering them to "cease and desist
from performing the functions and duties" of their respective offices
(Annex D, p. 10, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, Governor <span class="SpellE">Chiongbian</span>
appointed <span class="SpellE">Taclob</span>, a member of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panglunsod</span> of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tangub</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
as Officer-in-Charge of <span class="SpellE">Tangub</span> City in lieu of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Eleno</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Regidor</span> (Annex E, p. 11,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Taclob</span> belongs to the governor's political faction while <span class="SpellE">Regidor</span> and the other petitioner's belong to the rival
faction of Alfonso Tan, the defeated opponent of respondent <span class="SpellE">Chiongbian</span>
for the governorship of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition alleges that respondents Governor <span class="SpellE">Chiongbian</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> acted without authority, and contrary to law,
in issuing the Order of Preventive Suspension against the petitioners because
under Section 63 of the Local Government Code, a provincial or <u>city official</u>
may be preventively suspended by the Minister of Local Government, <u>not</u>
by the Provincial Governor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the petition, this Court issued a temporary
restraining order commanding the respondents to "cease and desist from
implementing or enforcing Resolution No. 340-88 dated November 23, 1988 and
Preventive Suspension Order dated November 24, 1988, and enjoining respondent
Robert O. <span class="SpellE">Taclob</span> from assuming the position of OIC
Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Tangub</span> City" (pp. 14-16, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In their comment on the petition, the respondents justified the
suspension of the petitioners as a valid exercise of the Provincial Governor's
power of general supervision over a component city (Par. 6.4, Section 1, Rule 4
of the Implementing Rules &amp; Regulations of the Local Government Code), and
that it was done “in pursuance to (sic) the provisions of the Local Government
Code and the Rules &amp; Regulations implementing said law." <span class="GramE">(p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the pertinent provisions of the Local Government Code
and the Implementing Rules and Regulations thereof do not sustain the
respondents' contention in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 61 of the Local Government Code provides that complaints
against elective provincial or city officials should be verified and <u>should
be filed before the Minister of Local Government</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 63 provides that the Minister of Local Government may
impose a preventive suspension against the accused elective provincial or city
official, thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>“Sec. 63.</i></span><i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Preventive Suspension</u>.</span>
- (1) <u>Preventive suspension may be imposed by the Minister of Local
Government if the respondent is a provincial or city official</u>, by the
provincial governor if the respondent is an elective municipal official, or by
the city or municipal mayor if the respondent is an elective <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> official.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"(2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Preventive
suspension may be imposed at any time after the issues are joined, when there
is reasonable ground to<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>believe that the
respondent has committed the act or acts complained of, when the evidence of
culpability is strong, when the gravity of the offense so warrants, when the
continuance in office of the respondent could influence the witnesses or pose a
threat to the safety and integrity of the records and other evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In all cases, preventive suspension shall not
extend beyond sixty days after the start of said suspension.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"(3<span class="GramE">)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At</span> the expiration of sixty days, the suspended official shall be
deemed reinstated in office without prejudice to the continuation of the
proceedings against him until its termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, if the delay in the proceedings of the case is due to his fault,
neglect or request, the time of the delay shall not be counted in computing the
time of suspension."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of the Implementing Rules &amp; Regulations reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>"Sec. 7.</i></span><i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Preventive Suspension.</span>
- If from the answer of the respondent, and the complaint filed, the Minister/<span class="SpellE">Sanggunian</span> concerned find and determine that there is
reasonable ground to believe that he has committed the act or acts complained
of, when the evidence of guilt is strong, when, the gravity of the offense so
warrants, or the continuance in office of the respondent could influence the
witnesses or pose a</i> <i>threat to the safety and integrity of the records
and other evidences, <u>the Minister of Local Government, provincial governor,
or municipal mayor as the case may be, may preventively suspend an elective
provincial, City, municipal or <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> official,
respectively;</u> Provided, That the preventive suspension shall not exceed
sixty (60) days after the start of said suspension."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the respondents' contention that the order
of preventive suspension issued by Governor <span class="SpellE">Chiongbian</span>
was within the authority granted in Section 7, Rule 18 of the Implementing
Rules &amp; Regulations to "the Minister of Local Government, <u>provincial</u>
governor, or municipal mayor, as the case may be," to "preventively
suspend an elective provincial, city, municipal or <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
official, respectively."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents misread and misconstrued Section 7, Rule 18 of the
Implementing Rules &amp; Regulations of the Local Government Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule should be read in juxtaposition with
Section 63 of the Code which provides that "preventive suspension may be
imposed by the Minister of Local Government <u>if the respondent is a
provincial or city official</u>, by the provincial governor if the respondent
is an elective municipal official, or by the city or municipal mayor if the
respondent is an elective <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> official." In
light of Section 63 of the Code, Section 7 of Rule 18 of the Implementing Rules
&amp; Regulations should be interpreted to mean that the Minister of Local
Government may preventively suspend an elective provincial or city official,
the Provincial Governor may preventively suspend an elective municipal
official, and the city or municipal mayor may preventively suspend an elective <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> official.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is as it should be for complaints against provincial or city
officials are supposed to be filed with the Minister (now Secretary) of Local
Government, hence, it is he (not the provincial governor) who would know
whether or not the charges are serious enough to warrant the suspension of the
accused elective provincial or city official.</p>

<p class="BODY">No rule or regulation issued by the Secretary of Local Government
may alter, amend, or contravene a provision of the Local Government Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The implementing rules should conform, not
clash, <span class="GramE">with</span> the law that they implement, for a
regulation which operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute is a
nullity (Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de
<span class="SpellE">Prieto</span>, L-13912, September 30, 1950).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A rule or regulation that was issued to
implement a law may not go beyond the terms and provisions of the law (People
vs. Lim, 108 Phil. 1091).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the implementing rule (Sec. 7, Rule 18) does not in
fact clash with the law (Sec. 63, Local Government Code) - the draftsmanship is
not perfect but the use of the phrase "as the case may be" and the
term “respectively" indicates a delineation of the power to suspend.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the complaint or complaints against the petitioners were filed
with the Office of the Provincial Governor, not with the Minister of Local
Government as required in Section 61 of the Local Government Code, and, as the
preventive suspension of the petitioners was ordered by the Provincial
Governor, not by the Minister of Local Government; the notice of hearing,
subpoena, and order of preventive suspension issued by the respondents governor
and members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span>
against the petitioners are hereby declared null and void. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>(Local Government Code [BP 337], Title Two,
Chapter 4, Sec. 63 [1].) The respondents are without authority to investigate the
petitioners, and the latter may not be compelled to attend the hearings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their refusal to answer the charges against
them was justified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">,</span>
the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
