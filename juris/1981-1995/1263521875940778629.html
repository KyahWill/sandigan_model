The question raised is whether or not petitioner is entitled to the 
payment of back salaries from September 19, 1975 to April 17, 1977, 
corresponding to the period he was separated from the government service
 by the President of the Philippines.
<p>
Petitioner, a certified public accountant, was an employee of the 
Commission on Audit, duly appointed as Deputy Auditor of the Central 
Bank.  He had been with the Commission on Audit since November 11, 1935 
where he had held various positions.  His separation, together with that
 of several hundred government employees, was pursuant to Letter of 
Instruction No. 309, series of 1975 and was made effective September 19,
 1975 (p. 35, rec.).
</p><p>
In a speech delivered on the occasion of the third anniversary of the 
proclamation of martial law, the President of the Philippines announced 
"the beginning of a sweeping, complete and exhaustive reorganization of 
the government" (Speech of President Marcos, 71 O.G. No. 39, Sept. 29, 
1975, pp. 6322K - 6322L).  One of those affected in the overhaul of 
govern足ment machinery was the Commission on Audit where hundreds of 
employees from the highest to the lowest rank were purged.
</p><p>
The names of all officials and employees affected by the reorganization,
 or by the September, 1975 purge, as it was called, including that of 
petitioner, were later published in the metropolitan dailies.
</p><p>
Petitioner appealed to the President.  Per memorandum of Presidential 
Executive Assistant Jacobo Clave dated March 28, 1977, petitioner was 
informed of the President's approval of his reinstatement as Deputy 
Auditor of the Central Bank.  Forthwith, by way of implementing the 
presidential order, respondent directed petitioner to report to his 
former office.  Petitioner reported on April 18, 1977.
</p><p>
On November 29, 1977, petitioner filed with the Commission on Audit his 
claim for the payment of his back salaries during the period he was out 
of the service.  He also sought clarification from the Office of the 
President regarding the effect of his reinstatement in the government 
service.  Acting on the foregoing request for clarification, the 
Presidential Executive Assistant on August 30, 1977 rendered a decision,
 the pertinent portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "As a rule, the reinstatement of government employee whose 
dismissal has been reconsidered carries with it payment of back 
salaries.  This however, applies only to instances where the dismissal 
is the result of an ordinary administrative case.  Separation from the 
service under the 'September 1975 purge' is of a different category.  <em>The
 policy of this office in the latter case is to deny backwages and other
 benefits to employees 'purged' but subsequently reinstated, they being 
considered under suspension during the period they were out of the 
service.  The employee concerned, however, may charge the period of 
their suspension to their leave of absence if any there be.  He may also
 collect such other benefits to which an employee on leave is ordinarily
 entitled </em>(Italics supplied)" [pp. 45-46, rec.]. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In his 1st Indorsement dated January 3, 1978, respondent denied 
petitioner's claim for back salaries strictly on the basis of the 
foregoing decision of the Office of the President.  Respondent's 
decision concludes:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Accordingly, Mr. Clemente who is considered under suspension from
 September 19, 1975 to April 17, 1977, the period he was out of the 
service, may charge such period to his leave of absence, if there be 
any, and collect only the money value of his leave credits corresponding
 to the same period, subject to the avail足ability of funds and the usual
 audit" (pp. 11-12, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In sustaining an affirmative answer to the question posed for 
resolution, petitioner cites the provision of Section 35, Article VII of
 Republic Act No. 2260, otherwise known as the Civil Service Law, which 
reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 35.  Lifting of Preventive Suspension Pending Administrative
 Investigation.  -- When the administrative case against the officer or 
employee under preventive suspension is not finally decided by the 
Commissioner of Civil Service within the period of sixty (60) days after
 the date of suspension of the respondent, the respondent shall be 
reinstated in the service.  If the respondent officer or employee is 
exonerated, he shall be restored to his position with full pay for the 
period of suspension."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To reinforce his allegation, petitioner cites the cases of Abellera vs. 
City of Baguio, et al. (19 SCRA 600), Tanala vs. Legaspi (13 SCRA 566) 
and Sison vs. Pajo (14 SCRA 160), where this Court upheld the payment of
 back salaries to re足instated employees corresponding to the period they
 were deprived of work.
</p><p>
As correctly observed by the Solicitor General, the above provision 
cited by petitioner applies only where the officer or employee concerned
 is placed under "preventive suspension," which is subsequently lifted 
when the officer or employee is finally exonerated.  In the case at bar,
 herein petitioner is differently situated.  As he has admitted, as of 
September 19, 1975, when he was purged, there was no pending 
administrative charge against him for any act or omission that warrants 
disciplinary action under pertinent laws and rules.  His separation from
 the service is not considered a preventive suspension contemplated 
under Section 35 of the Civil Service Law.  It is not the consequence of
 an administrative case, just as his reinstatement is not the result of 
an exoneration from administrative charges.
</p><p>
Webster, Third New International Dictionary of the English Language, gives the meaning of <em>purge</em>:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A purge is an act or instance of purging:  a ridding (as of a 
nation or party) of element or members regarded as treacherous, disloyal
 or suspect."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As We see it, the "September 1975 Purge" is part of the process of 
cleaning up the government machineries, which upon the imposition of 
martial law, the President had taken to task.  It was noted that the 
martial law in our country was not merely utilized to quell rebellion, 
but also to introduce institutional reforms and changes in the New 
Society, to eliminate the very causes of discontent that drive the 
people to rebellion.  Too well known fact is the evil that plagued 
government service.  Graft and corruption among government employees and
 officers were too rampant in almost all offices.  Numerous public 
officials, using their high positions for personal gain at the expense 
of the public, have not lived up to the public trust.  The program of 
reforms of the President in the New Society by instilling discipline on 
the people, particularly those in the government service, and by weeding
 out from the service employees and officials considered notoriously 
undesirable were envisioned as an answer to the long felt need for 
restoring the confidence of the people in the government.  It is in this
 context, therefore, that petitioner's separation cannot be categorized 
as preventive suspension provided in Section 35 of the Civil Service Law
 which orders payment of back salaries upon reinstatement.  His 
separation on September 19, 1975 was for all intent a dismissal pursuant
 to the urgently needed reform movement initiated by the President, 
which, as a compassionate gesture, was subsequently modified as 
suspension without pay -- a disciplinary penalty short of dismissal.
</p><p>
The President, of course, did not order the "September 1975 purge" by a 
snap of his fingers.  As adverted to earlier, the September, 1975 purge 
was made pursuant to Letter of Instruction No. 309, series of 1975 which
 was issued under the authority of Section 9, Article XVII of the 
Constitution, which vests upon the incumbent President the power to 
remove officials and employees of the existing government.  Pertinent 
portion of Section 9 reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 9.  All officials and employees in the existing Government 
of the Republic of the Philippines shall continue in office unless 
otherwise pro足vided by law or decree by the incumbent President of the 
Philippines x x."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Certainly, this dissipates all doubts petitioner entertained over the 
legality of his separation.  Said Section 9 of Article XVII qualifies 
during the transition Section 9, Article XII(B) of the Constitution 
which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 3.  No officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be suspended or dismissed except for cause as provided by law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At any rate, it is very significant to point out that petitioner's 
separation was based on the list submitted by then Acting Chairman 
Ismael Mathay Sr. of the Commission on Audit on August 28, 1975, or 
twenty-one (21) days before the purge.
</p><p>
The personal records of petitioner reveal that he had had an 
administrative case for which, although it was dismissed, petitioner was
 admonished by Mr. Mathay in his decision dated September 2, 1975, to 
wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "After due consideration of the findings and conclusions of the 
Committee created under Office Order No. 9122 dated July 24, 1974, which
 this Com足mission finds to be well taken and borne out by the record of 
the case, the aforementioned administrative case against you is hereby 
dismissed and the matter is considered closed.  However, you are hereby 
sternly admonished to exercise more caution and prudence and to comport 
yourself with the highest degree of responsibility in your official 
actuations in order to obviate similar occurrences in the future.  More 
specifically, you are exhorted to henceforth exercise closer and 
stricter supervision over your personnel assigned in the Currency 
Retirement Division of the Central Bank, and as much as possible to make
 a personal overseeing of their performance, including daily visits to 
their place of assignment for purposes of physical follow-up and ocular 
check-up of their respective tasks" (201 File). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To exonerate means "to exculpate, to relieve" (35 C.J.S., p. 227).  It 
is "to clear from accusation or blame" (Webster, Third New International
 Dictionary of the English Language).  The word "<em>exonerate</em>" "may imply <em>complete</em>
 clearance not only from immediate charge or accusation but from 
suspi足cion or attendant denigration" (Ibid.).  Petitioner was not 
completely exonerated of the administrative charge filed against him.  
The admonition to petitioner contained in the decision in the 
administrative case no more implies than that petitioner had also been 
remiss in the discharge of his duties.
</p><p>
Being a legal act therefore on the part of the President, petitioner is 
not entitled to back salaries.  Even the Letter of Instruction No. 647 
which was issued on December 27, 1977 in connection with the "September 
1977 Purge" does not authorize payment of backwages to purged but 
reinstated employees (Octot vs. Iba単ez, et al., 111 SCRA 79, 83-84).
</p><p>
Another point.  It is a settled rule in our jurisdiction that absent a 
showing that the dismissal was tainted with bad faith and in grave abuse
 of discretion, an employee is not entitled to backwages (Octot vs. 
Iba単ez, <em>supra</em>, citing San Miguel Corp. vs. Secretary of Labor, 
64 SCRA 56).  The separation of some 2,000 undesirables, which include 
herein petitioner was impelled by the desire to have reforms in all 
branches of the government, including the Commission on Audit where 
hundreds were involved.  The President had noted "that in a great number
 of cases, graft and corruption in the government has been possible only
 with the collusion, participation, if not at the instance, of personnel
 of the Commission on Audit" (Speech of President Marcos, <em>supra</em>).
  Before the measure for reforms was implemented, the government 
undertook a performance audit of all government officials and employees 
(Ibid.).  As We have said earlier, the list of employees of the 
Commission on Audit to be purged was submitted by Mr. Mathay on August 
28, 1978, when petitioner had still a pending administrative case.
</p><p>
The cases cited by petitioner are not in point.  The case of Abellera vs. City of Baguio, <em>supra</em>,
 refers to administrative suspension of a cashier in the Office of the 
City Treasurer of Baguio who was charged administratively for dishonesty
 and gross negligence in the performance of official duty.  In this 
case, the cashier, when found guilty by the Civil Service Commissioner 
of the charges against him, was deprived of work for two years, although
 on appeal to the Civil Service Board of Appeals, the ruling was 
modified by reducing the penalty imposed on him to only two months 
suspension without pay.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the cases of Ta単ala vs. Legaspi, <em>supra</em>, and Sison vs. Pajo, <em>supra</em>, refer to illegal dismissal.
</p><p>
The case of Ta単ala vs. Legaspi involves the administrative suspension 
and later, separation of a sanitary inspector from the government 
service who was later acquitted of the criminal charges against him and 
whose reinstatement was ordered by the President of the Philippines 
after a reversal of the decision of the Civil Service Commissioner in 
the administrative case which ordered his separation.
</p><p>
The case of Sison vs. Pajo deals with illegal dismissal and replacement 
of an employee who, by reason of the preference established by law in 
force at the time of his appointment, was entitled to keep his position 
until the Commissioner of Civil Service certified to the availability of
 a civil service eligible.
</p><p>
Petitioner relies further "as a matter of precedent" on the cases of 
other purged Commission on Audit officials, particularly Jose Trinos, 
former Department Manager, and Nicasio Pinto, former Assistant Auditor 
of Manila, who were allegedly both paid their back salaries covering the
 periods when they were purged.
</p><p>
The argument of the Solicitor General on this point is well taken:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "But petitioner is, as a matter of fact, differently situated than
 Messrs. Trinos and Pinto.  The records in the Commission on Audit 
dis足close that the case of Mr. Jose Trinos like those of other graduates
 of the Career Executive Service Development Program (CESDP) was taken 
cognizance of by a Special Committee created under Administrative Order 
No. 371 dated November 13, 1975; that upon recommendation of such 
committee, President Marcos issued Administrative Order No. 375 on 
December 25, 1975 whereby he reconsidered the acceptance of the 
resignation of Mr. Trinos, among others, and reinstated him to his 
position as Commis足sion on Audit Department Manager 'effective as of the
 date their (his) respective resignation was accepted.' A copy of said 
administrative order No. 375 is attached as Annex '2'.  The precise 
tenor of such order of reinstatement clearly signifies that Mr. Trinos 
was deemed as never having been out of the service since the effectivity
 of his reinstate足ment was made to retroact to the date of his 
separation.  Nor was he considered under suspension during the 
intervening period.  Thus, Mr. Trinos was clearly entitled to collect 
the salaries corresponding to the said period.  In contrast, 
petitioner's reinstatement was made 'effective immediately,' i.e., as of
 March 28, 1977. </p>
  <p> "In the case of Mr. Pinto, records in the Commission on Audit 
completely belie petitioner's allegation.  For, as disclosed therein, 
Mr. Pinto collected the money value of his <em>leave credits, not his sala足ries</em>,
 corresponding to the period that he was out of the service, from 
October 1, 1975 to January 5, 1977, as a result of his 'purge.' A 
certification to this effect, issued by the City Auditor Arturo V. Uy of
 Manila on March 9, 1978, is attached as Annex '3'" (pp. 43-44, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case at bar, herein petitioner who is not a Presidential 
appointee, did not tender a resig足nation, but was removed.  Not a 
graduate of CESDP, his reinstatement was not made retroactive to the 
date of his resignation.  The memorandum of Presidential Executive 
Assistant Jacobo Clave clearly states that reinstatement was to take 
effect "immediately." As regards the case of Mr. Pinto, suffice it to 
say that as the certification will show that he collected the money 
value of leave credits, it was not possible that he could still collect 
back salaries for the period he was out of the service.
</p><p>
Because petitioner had made several pleas for reinstatement to the 
President and followed up his case for no less than "fifty times" 
(Letter of Appeal dated November 26, 1976, 201 File), stressing the 
mental anguish and financial hardships he suffered as a result of his 
separation from the service (letter dated March 11, 1977, 201 File) and 
citing his 38 long years of loyal and dedicated service to the 
government and his achievements in his job (Ibid.), the President 
ordered his reinstatement only -- without back salaries.
</p><p>
No back salaries, therefore, can be ordered paid to petitioner.  
Petitioner, however, pursuant to the decision of the presidential 
executive assistant dated August 30, 1977, may charge the period of his 
suspension against his leave credits, if any, and may commute such leave
 credits to money value.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, THE INSTANT PETITION IS HEREBY DISMISSED.  NO COSTS.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro</em> and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
