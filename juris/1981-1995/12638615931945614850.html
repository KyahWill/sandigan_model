his adversary to the ground thinking him dead, but <span class="SpellE">Antaeus</span>
rose even stronger to resume their struggle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This happened several times to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>Finally, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">they continued grappling, it dawned on
Hercules that <span class="SpellE">Antaeus</span> was the son of Gaea and could
never die as long as any part of his body was touching his Mother Earth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

not as fanciful as the foregoing </span>tale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">But they also tell of the
elemental forces of life and death, of men and women who, like <span class="SpellE">Antaeus</span>, need the sustaining strength of the precious earth

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Recognizing this need,
the Constitution </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1935 mandated the policy of social justice to

diffuse property ownership and profits."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Constitution of 1987
was not to be outdone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides echoing
these sentiments, it also adopted one whole and separate Article XIII on Social
Justice and Human Rights, containing grandiose but undoubtedly sincere
provisions for the uplift of the common people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These include a call in the following words for the adoption by the
State of an </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">agrarian </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reform program:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>SEC. 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The State shall, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">by </span>law, undertake an agrarian reform program
founded on the right of farmers and regular <span class="SpellE">farmworkers</span>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">who are landless, to own directly or
collectively the lands they till or, in the case of other <span class="SpellE">farmworkers</span>,
to receive a just share of the fruits thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To this end, the State shall encourage and undertake the just
distribution of all agricultural lands, subject to such priorities and
reasonable retention limits </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
Congress may prescribe, taking into account ecological, developmental, or
equity considerations, and subject to the payment of just compensation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In determining retention limits, the State
shall respect the right of small landowners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The State shall further provide incentives for voluntary land-sharing.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Earlier, in fact, R.A.
No. 3844, otherwise known as the Agricultural Land Reform Code, had already
been enacted by the Congress of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="8" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">August 8, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, in line with the above-stated
principles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was substantially
superseded almost a decade later by P.D. No. 27, which was promulgated on
October 21, 1972, along with martial law, to provide for the compulsory
acquisition of private lands for distribution among tenant-farmers and to
specify maximum retention limits for landowners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The people power
revolution of 1986 did not change and indeed even energized the thrust for
agrarian reform.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 17,
 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, President
Corazon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> issued E.O. No. 228, declaring full
land ownership in favor of the beneficiaries of P.D. No. 27 and providing for
the valuation of still unvalued lands covered by the decree as well as the
manner of their payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was
followed on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 22, 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> by Presidential Proclamation No. 131,
instituting a comprehensive agrarian reform program (CARP), and E.O. No. 229,
providing the mechanics for its implementation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Subsequently, with its
formal organization, the revived Congress of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> took over legislative power from the
President and started its own deliberations, including extensive public
hearings, on the improvement of the interests of farmers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The result, after almost a year of spirited
debate, was the enactment of R.A. No. 6657, otherwise known as the
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988, which President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
signed on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">June 10, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
law, while considerably changing the earlier mentioned enactments, nevertheless

<p class="BODY">They contend that President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
usurped legislative power when she promulgated E.O. No. 228.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said measure is invalid also for
violation of Article XIII, Section 4, of the Constitution, for failure to
provide for retention limits for small landowners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

rentals </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">advance payment on the land, the executive
order also deprives the petitioners of their property rights as protected by
due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The equal protection clause
is also violated because the order places the burden of solving the agrarian
problems on the owners only of agricultural lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No similar obligation is imposed on the
owners of other properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioners also
maintain that in declaring the beneficiaries under P.D. No. 27 to be the owners
of the lands occupied by them, E.O. No. 228 ignored judicial prerogatives and
so violated due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Worse, the
measure would not solve the agrarian problem because even the small farmers are
deprived of their lands and the retention rights guaranteed by the Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

rate, the challenge to the order is premature because no valuation of their

insist they are proper parties because P.D. No. 27 does not provide for
retention limits on tenanted lands and that in any event their petition is a

compensation by the administrative authorities is a final ascertainment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As for the cases invoked by the public
respondent, the constitutionality of P.D. No. 27 was merely assumed in Chavez,

full for the lands they wanted to be distributed among the farmers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We may therefore assume that their intention
was to allow such manner of payment as is now provided for by the CARP Law,
particularly the payment of the balance (if the owner cannot be paid fully with
money), or indeed of the entire amount of the just compensation, with other
things of value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We may also suppose that
what they had in mind was a similar scheme of payment as that prescribed in
P.D. No. 27, which was the law in force at the time they deliberated on the new
Charter and with which they presumably agreed in principle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has not found in the records of the Constitutional
Commission any categorical agreement among the members regarding the meaning to
be given the concept of just compensation as applied to the comprehensive
agrarian reform program being contemplated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was the suggestion to "fine tune" the requirement to
suit the demands of the project even as it was also felt that they should
"leave it to Congress" to determine how payment should be made to the
landowner and reimbursement required from the farmer-beneficiaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such innovations as "progressive
compensation" and "State-subsidized compensation" were also
proposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the end, however, no
special definition of the just compensation for the lands to be expropriated
was reached by the Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn50" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, there
is nothing in the records either that militate against the assumptions we are
making of the general sentiments and intention of the members on the content
and manner of the payment to be made to the landowner in the light of the
magnitude of the expenditure and the limitations of the expropriator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">With these assumptions,
the Court hereby declares that the content and manner of the just compensation
provided for in the afore-quoted Section 18 of the </span>CARP Law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>not <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not mind </span>admitting that a
certain degree of pragmatism has influenced our decision on this issue, but
after all this Court is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>cloistered
institution removed from the realities and demands of society or oblivious to
the need for its enhancement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
is as acutely anxious as the rest of our people to see the goal of agrarian
reform achieved at last after the frustrations and deprivations <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of our peasant masses during all these
disappointing decades.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are aware that
invalidation of the said section will result in the nullification of the entire
program, killing the farmer's hopes even as they approach realization and
resurrecting the <span class="SpellE">spectre</span> of discontent and dissent in
the restless countryside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is not in
our view the intention of the Constitution, and that is not what we shall
decree today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accepting the theory that payment of the just compensation is not
always required to be made fully in money, we find further that the proportion
of cash payment to the other things of value constituting the total payment, as
determined on the basis of the areas of the lands expropriated, is not unduly
oppressive upon the landowner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
noted that the smaller the land, the bigger the payment in money, primarily
because the small landowner will be needing it more than the big landowners,
who can afford a bigger balance in bonds and other things of value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No less importantly, the government financial
instruments making up the balance of the payment are "negotiable at any
time." The other modes, which are likewise available to the landowner at
his option, are also not unreasonable because payment is made in shares of
stock, LBP bonds, other properties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>assets,
tax credits, and other things of value equivalent to the amount of just
compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, the compensation contemplated in the law will cause
the landowners, big and small, not a little inconvenience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As already remarked, this cannot be
avoided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Nevertheless, it is devoutly hoped that these countrymen of ours,
conscious as we know they are of the need for their <span class="SpellE">forebearance</span>
and even sacrifice, will not begrudge us their indispensable share in the
attainment of the ideal of agrarian reform.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, our pursuit of this elusive </span>goal will be like the
quest for the Holy Grail.</p>
