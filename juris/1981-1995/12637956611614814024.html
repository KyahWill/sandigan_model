<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence, as summarized by the trial court, and by 
the Solicitor-General states:</p>
<blockquote>The prosecution evidence shows that in line with its anti-narcotics 
campaign, the <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span> Police Station formed a team 
composed of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Coronel</span>, Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Ricamara</span>, Rolando Cruz, <span class="SpellE"><span>Cris</span>tino</span> <span class="SpellE">Magliad</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Cenen</span> <span class="SpellE">Payloma</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The team was ordered to go after a notorious drug pusher in <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span> known as Boy Flint.<span>&nbsp; </span>At about 
<st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30 P.M.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1982</st1:date> the members of the team talked to 
Eduardo Lim and asked him if he could help point out Boy Flint to them.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Eduardo agreed and received from the policemen, the sum of P200.00 in 
bills which, as agreed upon, he was going to use in buying marijuana from Boy 
Flint.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before giving the money to Eduardo, the policemen had the 
two P100.00 bills <span class="SpellE">xeroxed</span> (Exhibits "E" and "E-1") 
(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> pp. 2-4, <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="8">August

at different places.<span>&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, Eduardo approached and 
talked to a man who turned out to be the accused <span class="SpellE">Donilo</span> Santiago.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eduardo gave to the accused 
the P200.00 bills given to him by the policemen.<span>&nbsp; </span>After receiving 
the money, the accused went inside the compound where Boy Flint was allegedly 
staying.<span>&nbsp; </span>Five minutes later, the accused returned and handed to 
Eduardo dried marijuana leaves wrapped in a newspaper.<span>&nbsp; </span>Immediately 
then, Patrolmen Ortiz and <span class="SpellE">Ricamara</span> approached and 
tried to arrest the accused who was able to ran away.<span>&nbsp; </span>But before 
the accused could enter the compound of Boy Flint, the policemen were able to 
apprehend him near the gate of the compound.<span>&nbsp; </span>Right then and there, 
the policemen searched the body of the accused and found some marijuana leaves 
and two <span class="SpellE">mogadon</span> tablets hidden inside the sock of the 
accused.<span>&nbsp; </span>The policemen did not recover any money, however (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> pp.

<p class="BODY"><span>Upon</span><span> the </span><span>other hand, it is the 
position of the appellant that he is not </span><span>a drug </span><span>pusher 
at all, that it was not he who had promised to get any marijuana for Lim, that 
Lim never handed any money to him, much less the two P100.00 bills used as bail 
money for the purchase of the prohibited drug; that what actually happened 
insofar as he is concerned is the following:<span>&nbsp; </span>he was in a store on 
A. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, when Lim approached him and asked if he knew 
where a certain "Boy Flint" could be contacted, that while he did not know of 
the existence of a "Boy Flint", he knew of a certain "Boy", that he pointed out 
to him the building where said "Boy" was staying, that Lim went towards the 
building, that he then saw Lim conversing with someone from "Boy” 's household, 
that Lim gave the P200.00 to the person with whom he was talking, that the 
recipient then went inside the building, and a few minutes later, he (the 
recipient) came out and handed to Lim something which appeared to be covered, 
that shortly thereafter policemen entered the store, chased his friends out of 
the place, but he remained standing for he recognized one of the policemen as a 
former classmate of his, that he was </span>then asked by the police to 
accompany them to police headquarters so that he could act as a "witness", that 
while there he was shown a piece of paper which he was compelled to sign, so 
that he could be released, that he then asked permission to call his house, and 
one of his lawyer friends, but this was refused; that in his desire to get away 
as soon as possible, he was not able to read anymore the contents of the piece 
of paper (the paper turned out to be an affidavit admitting his participation in 
the sale of the prohibited drug).</p>
<p class="BODY">After <span>a </span>study of the case, <span class="GramE">We</span> have come to the conclusion that there is reasonable doubt 
as to the guilt of the appellant.</p>
<p class="BODY">Be it borne in mind that appellant was not actually the object of 
the drug-busting operation.<span>&nbsp; </span>The police authorities had for their 
intended quarry a certain "Boy Flint", ostensibly known in the vicinity as an 
inveterate drug pusher and there is certainly no dispute that appellant is not 
"Boy Flint" nor has he ever been known by such name.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then again 
consider the fact that appellant had no prior record as a drug pusher, nor had 
he ever been previously suspected to be one and the further fact that he stood 
his ground (in the store) when the policemen rushed in — while all his 
companions scampered away.<span>&nbsp; </span>A nagging question continues to trouble 
Us:<span>&nbsp; </span>why did the police deny appellant the benefit of calling up by 
phone one of his lawyer friends; and why did they ask him to sign an affidavit 
which is virtually an extrajudicial confession without first informing him of 
his constitutional rights and without the attendance of counsel?<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In fine, the charging of appellant appears to have been brought about by 
the police authorities to "save face" in their failure to apprehend "Boy 
Flint".<span>&nbsp; </span>It is true that a drug pusher is a vicious bane of our 
drug — deadened society, but first <span class="GramE">We</span> must make sure 
that the person We convict is indeed one.</p>

ACQUITTED of the crime charged.</p>
