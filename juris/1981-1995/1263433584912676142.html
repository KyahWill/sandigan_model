				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Assailed in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of
the Rules of Court is the resolution promulgated on August 1, 1991 by the
Sandiganbayan which granted the private respondent's motion to quash the
information for violation of <span style="">the </span>Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. No. 3019) on the ground <span style="">of </span>prescription or the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two letter-complaints were filed on October 28, 1986 and December
9, 1986, with the Tanodbayan by Teofilo Gelacio, a political leader of Governor
Valentina Plaza, wife <span style="">of </span>Congressman
Democrito O. Plaza of Agusan del Sur, shortly after the private respondent had
replaced Mrs. Plaza as OIC/provincial governor or Agusan del <span style="">Sur in </span>March 1986 (p. 235,
Rollo).  Gelacio's complaint questioned
the issuance to Governor Paredes, when he was still the provincial attorney <span style="">in </span>1976, of a free patent title for
Lot No. 3097-8, Pls. 67, with an <span style="">area
of </span>1,391 sq.m., more or less, in the Rosario public land subdivision <span style="">in </span>San Francisco, Agusan del Sur.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 23, 1989, the Tanodbayan referred the complaint to
the City Fiscal of Butuan City who subpoenaed Governor Paredes.  However, the subpoena was served on, and
received by, the Station Commander of San Francisco, Agusan del Sur, who did
not serve it on Paredes.  Despite the
absence of notice to Paredes, Deputized Tanodbayan/City Fiscal Ernesto Brocoy
conducted a preliminary investigation <u>ex</u> <u><span style="">parte</span></u><span style="">.  </span>He recommended that an information be
filed in court.  His recommendation was
approved by the Tanodbayan who, on August 10, 1989, filed the following
information in the Sandiganbayan where it was docketed as TBP Case No.
86-03368:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about January 21, 1976, or sometime prior or
subsequent thereto, in San Francisco, Agusan del Sur, Philippines, and within
the <span style="">jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused, a </span><span style="">public
</span><span style="">officer, being then the
Provincial Attorney of Agusan del </span>Sur, having been duly appointed and
qualified as such, taking advantage of his public position, did, then and
there, wilfully and unlawfully persuade, influence and induce the Land
Inspector of the Bureau of Lands, by the name of Armando L. Luison to violate
an existing rule or regulation duly promulgated by competent authority by
misrepresenting to the latter that the land subject of an application filed by
the accused with the Bureau of Lands is disposable by a free patent when the
accused well knew that the said land had already been reserved for a school
site, thus by the accused's personal misrepresentation in his capacity as
Provincial Attorney of Agusan del Sur and applicant for a free patent, a report
favorably recommending the issuance of a free patent was given by the said
Armando L. Luison, land inspector, thereby paving the way to the release of a
decree of title, by the Register of Deeds or Agusan del Sur, an act committed
by the accused, in outright prejudice of <span style="">the
public interest." (pp. 3-4, Rollo.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Paredes was arrested upon a warrant issued by the
Sandiganbayan.  Claiming that the
information and the warrant of arrest were null and void because he had been
denied his right to a preliminary investigation, Paredes refused to post
bail.  His wife filed a petition for
habeas corpus praying this Court to order his release (Paredes vs.
Sandiganbayan, 193 SCRA 464), but we denied her petition because the proper
remedy was for Paredes to file a bail bond of P20,000 fixed by the
Sandiganbayan for his provisional liberty, and move to quash the information
before being arraigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 5, 1991, Paredes filed in the Sandiganbayan <span style="">"An </span>Urgent Motion to Quash
Information and <span style="">to Recall Warrant of </span>Arrest"
alleging that:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="">1.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><!--[endif]-->he is charged for an offense which has prescribed;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="">2.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><!--[endif]-->the preliminary investigation, as well as the
Information prepared by the Tanodbayan and the Warrant of Arrest issued by the
Sandiganbayan were invalid for lack of notice to him of the preliminary investigation
conducted by Deputized Tanodbayan Ernesto M. Brocoy and Tanodbayan Prosecutor
Josephine Z. Fernandez; and<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="">3.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="">his
constitutional right to due process had been violated by the long delay in the
termination of the preliminary investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had filed their written arguments, the
Sandiganbayan issued <span style="">a<i> </i></span>resolution
on August 1, 1991 granting the motion to quash on the ground of prescription of
the offense charged.  The
Sandiganbayan's ratiocination of its resolution is quoted below:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The crime charged is alleged to have been committed on or
about January 21, 1976 when the accused allegedly misrepresented to a Lands
inspector of the Bureau of Lands that the land subject of the herein movant's
Application for a Free Patent was disposable land.  This misrepresentation allegedly resulted in the issuance of a
Torrens Title under a Free Patent to the herein accused-movant.  This, the Information avers, was prejudicial
to the public interest because the land in question had been reserved for a school
site and was, therefore, not disposable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, the charge is for the violation of Sec. 3(a) of R.A.
No. 3019 because the accused had allegedly persuaded, induced and influenced
the Public Lands Inspector to violate existing law, rules and regulations by
recommending approval of the free patent application.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The accused asserts
that </span>since at the time of the alleged commission of the crime (January
21, 1976) the period <span style="">of </span>prescription
was ten (10) years under Sec. 11 of R.A. No. 3019, the crime should have
prescribed in 1986.  The prosecution
seems to agree with the movant's statement as to the term of the prescriptive
period with the qualification that the period of prescription should have
commenced to run from March 28, 1985, when the complaint was allegedly filed by
the Republic for the cancellation <span style="">of </span>the
title.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx  xxx  xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The question then is
this:  when should the period of
prescription have commenced to run </span>as to the alleged misrepresentation
which persuaded, influenced and induced the Lands Inspector of the Bureau of
Lands resulting in the approval or the application or the accused for a free
patent?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx  xxx  xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Supreme Court has clearly stated that even in the case of
falsification of public documents, prescription commences from its recording
with the Registry of Deeds when the existence of the document and the averments
therein theoretically become a matter of public knowledge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx  xxx  xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The matter of improper inducement, persuasion or influence
upon the Lands Inspector allegedly applied by the accused through <span style="">his </span>misrepresentation may have been
unknown to others besides the two of them because their interaction would
presumably have been private.  The fact
of the improper segregation of <span style="">the </span>piece
of land in question and the grant thereof to the accused, however, became,
presumptively at least, a matter of public knowledge upon the issuance of a
Torrens Title over that parcel of non-disposable public land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx  xxx  xxx.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.  Notice to the whole world must be presumed
at the very latest on May 28, 1976 when the Register of Deeds of Agusan del Sur
issued Original Certificate of Title No. 8379 in the name of the accused as a
result of the grant of the patent on the school site reservation;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"5. The act of filing the </span>approved
free patent with the Registry of Deeds is notice duly given to the various offices
and officials of the government, e.g., the Department (Ministry) of Agriculture
and the Bureau of Lands, who are affected thereby specially because it is the
Bureau of Lands which files the approved patent application with the Registry
of Deeds.  If the land in question was
indeed reserved for a school site, then the Department (Ministry) of Education
would also know or would be presumed to know." (pp. 28-33, Rollo.)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Sandiganbayan could not abide the fact that the Lands
Inspector (Luison) who was supposedly induced by Paredes to violate the law,
and who did violate it by recommending approval of Paredes free patent
application was not charged with a crime.  The Sandiganbayan concluded:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>â€œIt would seriously strain credulity to say that while the violation
of law rules or regulation by the Lands Inspector was obvious and public (since
the school site had been titled in the name of the alleged inducer Pimentel<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a>), the beneficiary thereof could not have been
suspected of having induced the violation itself.  It would be grossly unfair and unjust to say that prescription
would run in favor of the Lands Inspector who had actually violated the law put
not to the public official who had benefited therefrom and who may have,
therefore, instigated the favorable recommendation for the disposition of
non-disposable land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of all the foregoing, the Motion to Quash the
Information is granted." (p. 36, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Sandiganbayan further observed that since R.A. No. 3019 is a
special law, the computation <span style="">of </span>the
period for the prescription <span style="">of </span>the
crime of violating it is governed by Section 29 of Act No. 3326 which provides
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.  Prescription
shall begin to run from the day <span style="">of </span>the
commission of the violation of the law, and if the same be not known at the
time, from the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings
for its investigation and punishment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"The prescription
shall be interrupted when proceedings are </span>instituted against the guilty
person, and shall<sup> </sup>begin to run again if the proceedings are
dismissed for reasons not constituting jeopardy."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Sandiganbayan correctly observed that "the date of the
violation of the law becomes the operative date for the commencement of the
period of prescription" (p. 34, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Assuming </span>that
Paredes <span style="">did </span>induce Lands
Inspector Luison to recommend approval of his application for free patent
(which both of them denied doing), the date of <span style="">the violation, for the purpose </span>of computing the period <span style="">or prescription, would be the date </span><span style="">of </span>filing his <span style="">application on January 21, 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of the prosecution that the prescriptive period should
not commence upon the filing of Paredesâ€™ application because no one could have
known about it except Paredes and Lands Inspector Luison, is not correct for,
as the Sandiganbayan pointedly observed:  "it is not only the Lands Inspector who passes upon the
disposability or public land x x x other public officials pass upon the
application for a free patent including the location of the land and,
therefore, the disposable character thereof" (p. 30, Rollo).  Indeed, practically all the department
personnel, who had a hand in processing and approving the application, namely:  (1) the lands inspector who inspected the
land to ascertain its location and occupancy; (2) the surveyor who prepared its
technical description; (3) the regional director who assessed the application
and determined the land classification; (4) the Director of Lands who prepared
the free patent; and (5) the Department Secretary who signed it, could not have
helped "discovering" that the subject of the application was
nondisposable public agricultural land.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Sandiganbayan correctly observed that the "crime"
whether it was the filing of Paredesâ€™ application for a free patent in January
1976 or his supposedly having induced Luison to recommend its approval,
prescribed ten (10) years later, on January 21, 1986.  Gelacio's complaint, dated October 28, 1986, was filed late.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The reason for the </span>extinction
<span style="">of </span>the State's right to prosecute<span style=""> a crime after the lapse </span>of the
statutory limitation period for filing the criminal action, is that:</p>

<blockquote>"Statutes of Limitation are construed as being <u>acts</u> <u>of</u>
<u>grace</u>, and as a surrendering by<i> </i>the sovereign of its right to
prosecute or of its right to prosecute <span style="">at
its discretion, and they are considered as equivalent</span> to <u>acts</u> <u>of</u>
<u>amnesty</u>.  Such statutes are
founded on the liberal theory that prosecutions should not be allowed to
ferment <span style="">endlessly in the files of the
government </span>to <span style="">explode only after
witnesses </span>and <span style="">proofs necessary
to the </span>protection <span style="">of accused
have by sheer </span>lapse <span style="">of time
passed beyond availability.  They serve,
not only to bar prosecutions on aged and untrustworthy evidence, but also to
cut of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">prosecution for crimes a </span>rea<span style="">s</span>onable <span style="">time after completion, when no further danger to society is
contemplated from the criminal activity." </span>(22 CJS 573-574.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the absence of a special provision otherwise, <u>the</u> <u>statute</u>
<u>of</u> <u>limitations</u> <u>begins</u> <u>to</u> <u>run</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u>
<u>commission</u> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>offense</u> <u>and</u> <u>not</u> <u>from</u>
<u>the</u> <u>time</u> <u>when</u> <u>the</u> <u>offense</u> <u>is</u> <u>discovered</u>
or when the offender becomes known, or it normally begins to run when the crime
is complete." (22 CJS 585; Underscoring<b> </b>ours.)<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even if the ten-year prescriptive period commenced to run from
the registration and issuance of the free patent title by the Register of Deeds
on <u>May</u> <u>28,</u> <u>1976</u>, registration being constructive notice to
the whole world, the prescriptive period would have fully run its course on May
28, 1986, or five (5) months before Gelacio filed his complaint, and more than
thirteen (13) <span style="">years before judicial
proceedings </span>were <u>initiated</u> in the Sandiganbayan August 10,<span style=""> 1989 by </span>the filing of the <span style="">information therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Batas Pambansa Blg. 195 which was approved on March 16, 1982,
amending Section 11 of R.A. No. 3019 by increasing from ten (10) to fifteen
(15) years the period for the prescription or extinguishment of a violation of
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, may not be given retroactive
application to the "crime" which was committed by Paredes in January
1976 yet, for it would be prejudicial to the accused.  It would deprive him or the substantive benefit of the shorter
(10 years) prescriptive period under Section 11, R.A. 3019 which was an
essential element of the "crime" at the time he committed it.</p>

<blockquote>"Protection from prosecution under a statute of limitation is
a substantive right.  Where the statute
fixes a period of limitation as to a prosecution for a particular offense, the
limitation so fixed is jurisdictional, and the time within which the offense is
committed is a jurisdictional fact, it being necessary that the indictment or
information be actually filed within the time prescribed." (22 CJS 574.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Fact</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>statute</u> <u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>limitations</u> <u><span style="">is</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>jurisdictional</u> <u>necessarily</u>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To apply</span> B.P. <span style="">Blg. 195 </span>to Paredes would make it an <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> <u>post</u> <u>facto</u> law f</span>or it<span style=""> </span>would alter his situation to his disadvantage by making him
criminally liable for a crime that had already been extinguished under the law

are forbidden to pass â€˜any ex post facto law.â€™ Most all state constitutions
contain similar prohibitions against ex post facto laws.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An 'ex post facto law' is defined as a law which provides for
the infliction of punishment upon a person for an act done which, when it was
committed, was innocent; a law which aggravates a crime or makes it greater
than when it was committed; <span style="">a </span>law

annexed to <span style="">the crime when it was
committed:  a law that changes the rules

at the time <span style="">of the commission of the
offense in order to convict the offender; a law which, assuming to regulate </span>civil
