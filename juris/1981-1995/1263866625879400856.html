				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner questions the resolutions of the Civil Service Commission
(CSC) which reversed the findings of the CSC Merit Systems Board and the
Department of Education, Culture, and Sports on the validity of the private
respondent's reassignment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She contends
that if the CSC resolutions are sustained, it would result in the "triumph
of discourtesy and insubordination over that of order and efficiency in the
performance of official duty." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 2)</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the private respondent contends that the
declaration of excess teacher in the <span class="SpellE">Malvar</span>
Elementary School, her transfer by the Division Superintendent of City Schools
to another school, and other acts of harassment constitute removal not for
cause but because of personal ill-motives of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The comments filed by the private respondent and the Civil
Service Commission are treated as answers and the petition is decided
accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the
Solicitor General <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">agrees </span>with
the petitioner and recommends that the CSC resolutions be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span>
was appointed “National (City) Elementary Grades Teacher” in the Division of
City Schools, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1970" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her status <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">was </span>"Regular (Permanent) Reappointment." The position
to be filled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>"Item No.
15-702, RA 4092 (Intermediate)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy which led to this case arose at the beginning of
school year 1984-1985 when the student population of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malvar</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
significantly decreased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Classes in the
intermediate level were reduced from eleven to ten resulting in an overall
excess of one teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was, however,
a vacancy in Grade IV in the primary level.</p>

<p class="BODY">Following the "Guidelines Governing Excess Teachers",
Circular No. 10, Series of 1982 of the Division of City Schools, the 58
teachers of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malvar</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place> were
evaluated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The performance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">rating </span>showed that <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> ranked No. 55 with Rebecca <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, Elena <span class="SpellE">Morelos</span>, and
Rosario <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span> ranking <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Nos. </span>56, 57, and 58
respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When length of service and
relative fitness were added to performance ratings, <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> ranked last.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was, therefore, declared as excess teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When efforts to find an acceptable position
in the intermediate grades were unsuccessful, she was assigned to the Grade IV
class.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> refused to accept the
new <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">assignment </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">insisted on any class provided it was in the
intermediate grades.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The refusal
prompted </span>petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Orcino</span>, principal of the school, to recommend that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Ms. </span><span class="SpellE">Moti</span> be
reassigned to another school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The then
Superintendent Josefina Navarro assigned the respondent first to <span class="SpellE">Lakandula</span> Elementary School and later, to <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Salvador Elementary School.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of complying with the order of the Division
Superintendent, respondent <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> filed a protest with
the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">(MECS).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The MECS
sustained the Superintendent's order and ruled that Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti's</span>
transfer to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Moises</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Salvador</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was justified by the facts and the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent decided to go to the Civil Service Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CSC Merit Systems Board ruled that the reassignment of Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> to another school was in order and dismissed her
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Commission
itself, the CSC set aside the orders of the Merit Systems Board and ordered Ms.
<span class="SpellE">Moti</span> restored to her former position of Grade VI
classroom teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Disciplinary action
against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Orcino</span> was also ordered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition</p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule, the Court respects the factual findings of the Court
of Appeals and quasi-judicial agencies like the CSC, giving them a certain

</span>Findings of facts of the Court of Appeals <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In this particular case, both the Regional Director and the
Minister of the MECS and <span class="SpellE">CSC's</span> own Merit System's
Board sustained the recommendations made by the petitioner and upheld the
actions of the Division Superintendent of City Schools.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have examined the records carefully and
agree with the Solicitor General that the questioned CSC resolutions are not
supported by the evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that the decreased enrollment in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malvar</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
led to a reduction of classes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Faced
with an excess of teachers, it was the duty of the petitioner as school
principal to recommend a solution to the problem.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no factual basis for the CSC conclusion that the
reassignment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> to another class or
another school violated her security of tenure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and </span>the statutory restriction that any reassignment should not
involve a reduction in rank, status or salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reassignment from Grade VI to Grave IV involves no reduction in
rank, status, or salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
showing in the records that there <span class="GramE">is</span> less honor in
teaching Grades I to IV than in teaching Grades V to VI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is erroneous for the CSC to even intimate
that an intermediate teacher is demoted when asked to teach a lower grade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The best teachers should welcome assignments
to teach Grade One as this is where young minds need the best guidance and
inspiration from talented and dedicated mentors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the reassignment was not only
justified but also necessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether the transfer from one school to another was
disciplinary, the records show that respondent <span class="SpellE">Moti</span>
was appointed "National (City) Elementary Grades Teacher" in the
Division of City Schools, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Annex 1, Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">88) </span>The Solicitor General
correctly observes that her appointment is without specific station and does
not specify any assignment as Grade VI teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Elementary Grades Teacher, she could be assigned to any public
elementary school in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> and
ordered to teach any Grade or subject within her competence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The entries in the lower half of her appointment paper, alongside
and below the signature of the appointing authority are merely informative,
specifying where she would be assigned and stating some personal data.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General states that "these
words do not constitute the appointment." (Manifestation in Lieu of
Comment, p. 16) Among them are - Position to be filled:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Item No. 15-702, Page No. 303, RA 4092
(Intermediate); Authorized Salary Range 35, Authorized Salary Rate 3264 and
such entries as title, place, and date of teacher's examination, maiden name,
performance rating, highest educational attainment, last station, who recommended
her, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 88)</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent cannot rely on her initial assignment to fill a
specific vacancy in the Intermediate Grades in a particular school as giving <span class="GramE">her a</span> vested right to that item.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She can be assigned to any grade anywhere in
the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> in the best
interests of the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can the alleged length of experience of the respondent
strengthen her case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The CSC finding
that Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> taught Grade VI for 13 years is pointed
out by the Solicitor General as contradicted by the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only in 1983-1984 or the year before
her questioned transfer that she was assigned to Grade VI-2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Manifestation in Lieu of Comment, p. 14)</p>

<p class="BODY">The CSC disregarded the record before it - the revised check list
to determine the allotment of teachers based on number of classes, the maximum
teaching loads in specific subject areas per teacher, the number of subject
preparations, and the table on how the number of classroom and special teachers
for a certain number of pupils and grades is determined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show that all relevant factors
were considered when MECS and the Merit Systems Board reviewed the
Superintendent's action and sustained it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(See Original Records, pp. 48-65)</p>

<p class="BODY">There are other findings of the CSC which are contrary to the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CSC stated that there could have been no reduction of
intermediate classes from eleven (11) to ten (10) because <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>1984-1985, there were still the
same five sections in G<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">r</span>ade <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">VI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>This
is non-sequitur.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Intermediate" consists of Grades V and VI, not Grade VI
alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, teachers in those
grades teach according to <u>subject</u> <u>areas</u> instead of teaching all
subjects in one class of one grade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
matter was thoroughly studied by the Division Superintendent and she was not
misled on the number of classes and teachers <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">in</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span><u>the</u>
<u>entire</u> <u>school</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>before
she issued the appointments and transfer orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is likewise nothing arbitrary in the
selection of the respondent as “excess" teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She ranked 58th out of 58 teachers evaluated
for performance, length of service, and relative fitness.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CSC found something wrong in the transfer of <span class="SpellE">Merly</span> Evangelista to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malvar</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and the reassignment of a provisional substitute teacher as elementary grade
teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also questioned why
respondent <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> was reassigned to Grade IV and then
transferred to two other schools in June and July, 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that when Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span>
became an excess teacher and pending her assignment to Grade IV, she was asked
to do office work, library work, and other assignments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing wrong in this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She could not be twiddling her thumbs while
being paid her usual salaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
given her choice of a morning Grade IV class, with three other teachers
yielding to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she refused,
another teacher was assigned to the morning class.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she also turned down the remaining
afternoon class, another teacher was appointed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, the reassignments and the appointments subject of her complaints
were prompted by the changes in school population and her stubborn refusal to
obey lawful orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A cooperative
attitude and a certain degree of flexibility are required of all who profess to
be educators.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CSC found personal motives, bias, and injustice behind the
petitioner's acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That there is bad
blood between the petitioner and the private respondent is apparent from the
records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On June 27, 1984 or one day
before the petitioner recommended to Superintendent Navarro that Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> be declared an "excess teacher", the latter
filed a complaint with the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> alleging among
others that Ms. <span class="SpellE">Orcino</span> was collecting P1.00 each from
teachers who failed to sign the city share payrolls and P10.00 each for the
purchase of an image of the <span class="SpellE">Sto</span> <span class="SpellE">Niño</span>
for the school premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was,
however, immediately denied by some teachers who claimed that there were
contributions for whoever was following up their payrolls at City Hall and for
the <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Niño</span>, but these
were purely voluntary on the teachers’ initiative and Ms. <span class="SpellE">Orcino</span>
had nothing to do with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint was dismissed by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> on <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1985</st1:date> (Original Records, pp.
4-9; pp. 93-96)</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Ms. <span class="SpellE">Orcino</span> filed
also on June 28, 1984, a complaint with the Superintendent of City Schools
against Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> charging her with non­-cooperation
in specified school activities, reading newspapers during rehearsals for
graduation exercises even with the Principal and Assistant Principal around,
talking and laughing during baccalaureate mass to the annoyance of the priest,
refusal to submit lesson plan and record book and to sit with the evaluators of
the performance ratings and other acts of defiance of specified school
regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charges were found
valid and Director <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Boquiren</span>
of the MECS National Capital Region fined Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span>
the equivalent of five (5) days salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Original Records, pp. 38-47)</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent charged Ms. <span class="SpellE">Orcino</span>
with coercing and <span class="SpellE">embarassing</span> her and telling her to
stop attending meetings of teacher associations, cease making representations
for better professional and economic benefits of teachers, avoid joining
delegations to <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> for the upgrading of
teachers’ benefits, etc.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, in all these charges <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and </span>counter-­charges, the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>sustained by the Division
Superintendent, Regional Director, Department Head, and CSC Merit Systems’
Board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the CSC arrived at different
findings without, as earlier stated, any factual basis on record for its conclusions.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, even assuming that the CSC is correct and that its
findings are not based on surmises and presumptions, there is no explanation
why the petitioner, a <u>p</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">urely</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>recommendatory</u> <u>authority</u> </span>should
be the one penalized and disciplined while the Superintendent of City Schools
who ordered the transfer and the higher MECS authorities who did not reverse
it, remain free of blame.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there was
any abuse of authority or arbitrariness, the Division Superintendent of <st1:place><st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Schools</st1:placetype></st1:place> who makes all the
appointments, transfers, and other personnel action should have been charged
and not the Principal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Superintendent could have rejected the recommendation to transfer Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> and ordered her retention in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malvar</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and the petitioner would have been bound to obey.</p>

this Court held that an excellent principal in a model and centrally located
school may be transferred to a struggling school in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>less attractive community to improve standards and to
"spur the improvement of small schools" (at p. 149).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the interest of the service
may dictate that the worst school should get the best principal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same principle applies to classroom
teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No one has the vested right to
balk at difficult assignments ordered for the best interests of the
service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There would be nothing
disciplinary in this and other transfers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the bad blood existing between Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span>
and Ms. <span class="SpellE">Orcino</span>, the Division Superintendent of
Schools had to choose between transferring one or the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since Ms. <span class="SpellE">Moti</span> was
clearly at fault, Superintendent Navarro exercised her sound discretion in
reassigning the private respondent to another school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We see no error, much less grave abuse of
discretion in her choice.</p>

without trial or hearing, and even without the consent of the employee.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The clue to such transfers may be found in the ‘nature of the
appointment.’ Where the appointment does not indicate a specific station, an
employee may be transferred or reassigned provided the transfer affects no
substantial change in title, rank and salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, one who is appointed ‘principal in the Bureau of Public Schools’
and is designated to head a pilot school may be transferred to the post of
principal of another school.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And the rule that outlaws <span class="SpellE">unconsented</span>
transfers as anathema to security of tenure applies only to an officer who is
appointed -- not merely assigned -- to a particular station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a rule does not prescribe <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>transfer carried out under a
specific statute that empowers the head of an agency to periodically reassign
the employees and officers in order to improve the service of the agency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The use of approved techniques or methods in
personnel management to harness the abilities of employees to promote optimum
public service cannot be objected to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither does illegality attach to the transfer or reassignment of an
officer pending the determination of an administrative charge against him, or
to the transfer of an employee from his assigned station to the main office, <span class="GramE">effected</span> in good faith and in the interest of the service
pursuant to Section 32 of the Civil Service Act."</blockquote>
