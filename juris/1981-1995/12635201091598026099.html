				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This is a revival of the immorality charge against respondent <span
class=SpellE>Justiniano</span> P. <span class=SpellE>Naz</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Salvacion</span> E. <span class=SpellE>Marcayda</span> in a
handwritten letter filed in this Court on <st1:date Month="4" Day="19"
Year="1977"><u>April 19, 1977</u></st1:date> asked that <span class=SpellE>Naz's</span>
oath-taking as a member of the bar (after having flunked twice) be withheld
pend­ing negotiations for the support of his alleged child begotten with <span
class=SpellE>Salvacion</span>.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Naz</span> in his answer of <st1:date Month="4"
Day="27" Year="1977"><u>April 27, 1977</u></st1:date> denied the paternity of
the child. He alleged that the complaint was pure harassment and blackmail. He
said that <span class=SpellE>Salvacion</span> could have filed an
administrative complaint with the Department of Education and Culture since he
was employed in the <span class=SpellE>Legaspi</span> branch of that Office but
she never filed any such complaint.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=BODY>Accompanying his answer was an affidavit wherein <span
class=SpellE>Naz</span> requested that, because clearance could not be given
him to take the oath on <u>April 29, 1977</u> due to <span class=SpellE>Salvacion's</span>
complaint, he be allowed to take the oath but his signing of the Roll of
Attorneys be deferred pending resolution of <span class=SpellE>Salvacion's</span>
complaint.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the following day, <u>April 28, 1977</u>, <span class=SpellE>Naz</span>
and <span class=SpellE>Salvacion</span>, both 47, natives of <span
class=SpellE>Camalig</span>, <span class=SpellE>Albay</span>, executed in <st1:City><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:City>
a notarized agreement before lawyer <span class=SpellE>Braulio</span> R. G. <span
class=SpellE>Tansinsin</span> wherein <span class=SpellE>Naz</span> admitted
that he had an affair with <span class=SpellE>Salvacion</span> in 1964 as a
result of which a boy named <span class=SpellE>Rey</span> E. <span
class=SpellE>Marcayda</span> was born on <st1:date Month="1" Day="8" Year="1965">January
 8, 1965</st1:date>, (should be <st1:date Month="3" Day="8" Year="1965"><u>March
 8, 1965</u></st1:date>, as shown in Exhibit 2). <span class=SpellE>Naz</span>
was a married man. <span class=SpellE>Salvacion</span> was married to Primo <span
class=SpellE>Marcayda</span> who died of tuberculosis on <st1:date Month="7"
Day="5" Year="1965"><u>July 5, 1965</u></st1:date> (<span class=SpellE>Exh</span>.
1).</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Naz</span> in that agreement bound himself to
pay <span class=SpellE>Salvacion</span> for <span class=SpellE>Rey's</span>
support (1) back support of P2<span class=GramE>,000</span> on or before
December 25, 1977 and another P2,000 on or before December 25, 1978 and (2)
P100 or its dollar equivalent in advance within the first five days of every
month, starting May, 1977 until <span class=SpellE>Rey</span> reached the age
of twenty-one.</p>

<p class=BODY>Because of that public instrument admitting pater­nity and the
promise to support the adulterous child, <span class=SpellE>Salvacion</span> on
<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt'>that </span>same date, <st1:date
Month="4" Day="28" Year="1977"><u>April 28, 1977</u></st1:date>, withdrew her
complaint filed in this Court to withhold the oath-taking of <span
class=SpellE>Naz</span> on the ground of immorality.</p>

<p class=BODY>The withdrawal document was also executed before Notary <span
class=SpellE>Tansinsin</span>. It is document <u>No. 628</u> of his <span
class=SpellE>nota­rial</span> book while the document of acknowledgment and
support is No. <u>629</u>.</p>

<p class=BODY>The result of these last minute maneuvers was this Court's
resolution of <st1:date Month="4" Day="28" Year="1977"><u>April 28, 1977</u></st1:date>
allowing <span class=SpellE>Naz</span> to take his oath by reason of <span
class=SpellE>Salvacion's</span> withdrawal of her complaint (SBC-582). He took
his oath on <st1:date Month="4" Day="29" Year="1977"><u>April 29, 1977</u></st1:date>.
But <span class=SpellE>Naz</span> did not live up to his promise to give
support.</p>

<p class=BODY>In a verified complaint dated <st1:date Month="12" Day="23"
Year="1977"><u>December 23, 1977</u></st1:date> <span class=SpellE>Salvacion</span>
asked for the reopening of the administrative case. She alleged that she
withdrew the complaint so that <span class=SpellE>Naz</span> would have a
higher salary and would be in a better position to support <span class=SpellE>Rey</span>.
He is now <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>an </span>incumbent legal
officer of Region V of the Ministry of Education and Culture in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span
  class=SpellE>Legaspi</span></st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>City</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
with an annual salary of P17<span class=GramE>,724</span>.</p>

<p class=BODY>She testified that after <span class=SpellE>Rey's</span> birth <span
class=SpellE>Naz</span> gave her forty pesos a month for six months. After she
withdrew her complaint, <span class=SpellE>Naz</span> gave her one hundred
pesos for May, 1977. As already stated, he did not comply with his commitment
in the <span class=SpellE>notarial</span> agreement of support which was the
basis of the withdrawal of the immorality complaint against him.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Naz</span> in his comment on the complaint and
in his testimony in the Solicitor General's office declared that <span
class=SpellE>Rey</span> was not his son. <span class=SpellE>Rey's</span> 1965
birth certifi­cate shows that he was born in wedlock to <span class=SpellE>Salvacion</span>
and her husband, Primo (<span class=SpellE>Exh</span>. 2). He alleged that he
was &quot;coerced&quot; to sign the agreement of support. The complaint was
like &quot;an <span class=SpellE>Armalite</span> trained on the head of the res­pondent&quot;.</p>

<p class=BODY>We hold that, as noted by the Solicitor General, <span
class=SpellE>Naz</span> is not guilty of <u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>gross </span>immorality</u>. He should not be disbarred because he had
admitted the paternity of <span class=SpellE>Rey</span> in a public document
and agreed to support him. This circumstance rendered his immorality not so
gross and scandalous. <span class=GramE>(<span class=SpellE>Arciga</span> vs. <span
class=SpellE><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Maniwang</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>, </span>Adm. Case No. 1608, August 14, 1981,
106 SCRA 591).</span></p>

<p class=BODY><u>The agreement of support was basis of the withdrawal of the
1977 complaint against him</u>. The eleventh-hour withdrawal paved the way for
his oath-taking. He cannot be allowed to repudiate that public document on the
ground of supposed coercion.</p>

<p class=BODY>Respondent <span class=SpellE>Naz's</span> stand of not giving
any value to that public document shows a certain unscrupulous­ness unbecoming
a member of a noble profession. It is tantamount to self-stultification. His
attitude is highly censurable. He wants to make a mockery of the proceedings in
this Court by making it appear that he lied brazenly about the <span
class=SpellE>filiation</span> of <span class=SpellE>Rey</span> <span
class=SpellE>Marcayda</span> just to facilitate his admission to the bar. In
his oath, he swore to do no falsehood.</p>

<p class=BODY>The remedy of complainant <span class=SpellE>Marcayda</span> is a
civil action for support on the basis of the agreement of support which is <u>irrevocably
binding on <span class=SpellE>Naz</span></u>. She could also file an
administrative complaint against him with the Ministry of Education and Culture
which could require him to give support to the child, <span class=SpellE>Rey</span>
(See sec. 36, Civil Service Decree, P. D. No. 807).</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent <span class=SpellE>Naz</span> is
severely reprimanded for his attempt to nullify the <span class=SpellE>notarial</span>
agree­ment to support a child whose <span class=SpellE>filiation</span> he had
admitted. A copy of this resolution should be attached to his record in the Bar
Confidant's office.</p>
