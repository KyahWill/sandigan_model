dismissing their petition for, <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction and (2) upholding the order of the respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Adurru-Santillan</span> of
the Regional Trial Court denying petitioners' motion for a writ of preliminary
injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as found by the respondent court, are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>Civil Case No. 84-26196 was filed by plaintiffs (petitioners
herein) on a claim of ownership by extraordinary acquisitive prescription of
lots no. 2520 and 2512 located at Felix <span class="SpellE">Huertas</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Sta</span> Cruz, Manila, and the improvements thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs also sought to enjoin the
defendants (private respondents herein) from further demolishing or destroying
the remnants of the structures built on the land, and sought recovery of
actual, moral and exemplary <span class="GramE">damages,</span> and determination
of the issue of ownership over the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The defendants claimed absolute ownership of the lots in question as
evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 160694 of the Register of Deeds
of Manila, and relied on the regularity and lawful issuance of the Demolition
Order No. 014 S-1984 dated <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="6">June 11,
 1984</st1:date> issued by the City Engineers' Office, Lands and Building
Official.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants made a counter-claim
for moral damages and attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon motion of the plaintiffs, the respondent Judge issued on <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1984</st1:date> a restraining order
to prevent defendants from the commission of acts that will dispossess
plaintiffs of their temporary shelter, and enjoining plaintiffs from
introducing additional improvements on the land and/or expanding the facilities
existing thereon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1985</st1:date>,
defendant <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Reyeses</span></span>,
manifesting that the aforesaid Order has been violated by plaintiffs through
expansion of the makeshift "barong-barong" by about two (2) meters of
its frontage, moved to cite plaintiffs in contempt of court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs' did not challenge the merit of
the motion, but instead filed an urgent motion on <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1985</st1:date> for immediate issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction in reiteration of their prayer in the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A hearing was conducted, at which the parties
orally argued their respective positions and sought for the filing of
respective memoranda after which the case shall be deemed submitted for
resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Judge in an
Order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1985</st1:date>,
found that the evidence submitted by plaintiffs to support the claim of
continuous and uninterrupted residence in the premises since 1947 could not be
given probative value, and upheld the claim of defendant on the basis of a
Torrens Certificate of Title in its favor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the issue of physical possession, the Court held that <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">defendant</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
Engineer and Building Official of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
had acted within the scope of his authority under the National Building Code
and the applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ordinances of the
City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> ordering the
demolition of structures found to be dangerous or ruinous and detrimental to
the life, health and safety of the community and its members.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondent Judge ruled that the ownership of the defendants
over the lots in question as proven by the Transfer Certificate of Title No.
160964 of the Registry of Deeds for Manila "is hereby confirmed", the
issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction is denied, and the case set for
pre-trial on the unresolved issues on the physical possession of the questioned
lots, and the claim for damages and attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plaintiffs did not file any motion for reconsideration of the said
order, but instead filed on <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="8">August 16,
 1985</st1:date> an urgent ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for
disqualification on the ground of partiality, bias and prejudice, preference
and pre-judgment against plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1985</st1:date>, plaintiffs filed
a manifestation that until after the question of disqualification shall have
been finally <span class="GramE">determined,</span> petitioners shall not attend
any hearing or trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On November 11, 1985, petitioners filed the instant petition,
claiming that respondent court acted arbitrarily and capriciously and with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to want or excess of jurisdiction when it
(1) issued the Order of July 1, 1985 "without<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>any evidence, documentary or testimonial, formally offered, had
virtually decided the case leaving only the question of damages and attorney's
fees unresolved"; and (2) issued its subsequent orders setting the case.
For pre-trial despite two motions for disqualification filed against her; and
(3) ignored the two motions for inhibition.</blockquote>

pp. 11-12-A.]</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the respondent Court of Appeals dismissed the
special civil action filed by petitioners and held that (1) any error committed
by the trial court in its factual or legal findings is correctible by appeal
and not by <i>certiorari</i>; (2) the trial court committed no whimsical or
capricious error in arriving at the legal conclusion that the city engineer
acted within the scope of his authority in issuing the demolition order; and
(3) the failure of the judge of the trial court to resolve the motion for her
disqualification did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to continue
hearing the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">As petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied, recourse
was sought in this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The instant
petition for review specifically points out the following as errors allegedly
committed by the respondent court:</p>

AND DEMOLISH PETITIONERS' HOUSES, CARRIED OUT IN BAD FAITH, DECEIT, AND IN
UTTER DEPRIVATION OF DUE PROCESS-- ALL THESE BY DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

RESPONDENT JUDGE WAS NOT CALLED FOR UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 87-88.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On the first assigned
error, petitioners contend that there was a conspiracy between the public <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">respondents</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
Engineer and Building Official of Manila and the private respondents Carmen <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Reyes and Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, who are mother and son, as shown by the alleged
deceptions committed by the latter in:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>1) making it appear that private respondents Carmen <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
de Reyes and Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes were the owners not
only of the lots but also of the houses; 2) sending the order of demolition
not<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to the petitioners who claim to be
the owners of the houses but to "Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes, et al." [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 4.]; and, 3) alleging
in their answer to the complaint for recovery of ownership and possession of
the disputed properties that Petitioners were legally and validly given notices
to vacate the premises in view of the demolition order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners insist that because of the
failure of private respondents to notify them of the order of demolition, they
were rendered "helpless and unknowing of what was going on about
them" and they were not able to resort to the remedies accorded to them by
the National Building Code Rules and Regulations [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 5.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention of a conspiracy between the private
respondents and the Manila City Engineer to demolish their houses involves a <span class="GramE">factual</span> matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
well-established rule is that findings of facts of the trial court are entitled
to great respect and will not be disturbed except for strong and cogent reasons
[Mendoza v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-45898, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 18, 1987</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 156 SCRA 597; <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> de <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 64728, July
22, 1986, 143 SCRA 77; Republic v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No.
70594, October 10, 1986, 144 SCRA 705.] Here, the petitioners' claim that
private respondents committed deception in failing to notify them of the order
of demolition was not given any credence by the trial court which found that
"what happened was their houses had been demolished' through their
inaction" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 47.] This is borne out by
the evidence on record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, although the demolition order was addressed to "Mr.
Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>" as
owner of the property, the affected tenants including, the petitioners were
duly furnished with a copy of said order (<u>See</u> Original Records, p. 77.]</span>
Since the demolition order which was dated <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1984</st1:date> was carried out only on <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1984</st1:date>, petitioners therefore had ample time
to contest the said order and resort to the remedies available to them under
the National Building Code (Presidential Decree No. 1096) but this they failed
to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court therefore finds no
compelling reason to warrant setting aside the trial court's findings, which
were affirmed by the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">II<span class="GramE">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The</span>
next issue revolves around the order of demolition dated <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1984</st1:date> issued by the respondent City
Engineer and Building Official of Manila on the subject buildings or structures
standing on the lots now in dispute, which were condemned as not fit for human
habitation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioners,
the demolition order was illegal since the Building Official was not authorized
to issue the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' position
is that since the houses were also considered as nuisances, it is the district
health officer, not the Building Official who decides on the propriety of
abatement or demolition in view of the provision of Article 702 of the Civil
Code which states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Article 702.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The district health officer shall determine
whether or not abatement, without judicial proceedings, is the best remedy
against a public nuisance.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This contention is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The issue presented before the court, <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is not really
whether the structures can be considered a nuisance under the Civil Code but
whether there has been a violation of the National Building Code so as to
warrant an order for the demolition of said structure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here, the Building Official was authorized to
issue the questioned demolition order in view of his finding that the disputed
structures are dangerous buildings and structures within the meaning of the
National Building Code (<u>See</u> Rule VII, Section 3, Implementing Rules and
Regulations of the National Building Code.] This factual finding will not be
disturbed by the court absent a showing of a clear, manifest and grave abuse of
discretion amounting to want of jurisdiction [<span class="SpellE">Sagun</span> <u>et</u>
<u>al.</u> v. People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and Housing
Corporation, G.R. No. 44738, <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="6">June 22,
 1988</st1:date>.]<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to petitioners' position, the fact that the buildings in
question could also constitute nuisances under the Civil Code does not preclude
the Building Official from issuing the assailed demolition order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the National Building Code itself
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>When any building or structure is found or declared to be dangerous
or ruinous, the Building Official shall order its repair, vacation or demolition
depending upon the degree of danger to life, health or safety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>This</u> <u>is</u> <u>without</u> <u>prejudice</u>
<u>to</u> <u>further</u> <u>action</u> <u>that</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>taken</u>
<u>under</u> <u>the</u> <u>provisions</u> <u>of</u> <u>Articles</u> <u>482</u> <u>and</u>
<u>484</u> <u>to</u> <u>707</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Civil</u> <u>Code</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u> [Second paragraph of Section 214.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">III<span class="GramE">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The</span>
third issue deals with the propriety of <i>certiorari</i> as the remedy
resorted to by the petitioners from the questioned order of the trial judge.
Petitioners brought a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> to the
appellate court on the ground that the respondent trial judge committed grave
abuse of discretion in issuing the order denying the writ of preliminary
injunction prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be borne in mind that the action of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in denying the writ was premised on the failure of the petitioners to show that
they have a right to be protected and preserved during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found
without any probative value the evidence adduced by petitioners to support
their claim of ownership by acquisitive prescription through continuous and
uninterrupted residence in the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, the trial court found private respondents' claim of
ownership based on a deed of sale executed in their favor on <st1:date year="1984" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1984</st1:date> by <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank tenable [<u>See</u> <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 15 <u>et</u> <u>seq.</u>] In the aforesaid contract of sale, <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank conveyed to private respondents the
ownership of the disputed lots, Lot Nos. 2520 and 2512, among other lots, and
"all the buildings and improvements existing thereon and belonging to the
VENDOR" [<u>Id</u>. at p. 17.] Accordingly, the trial court held that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Rather, it is defendants
(private respondents herein) who have demonstrated the attribute of ownership
through the registration of the deed of conveyance over the lots and subsequent
issuance of transfer certificate of title in favor of defendants which could
not have been made without first paying the real estate taxes by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u>jus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>disponendi</u></span>
as an element of ownership was never questioned by the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These negate the claim of plaintiffs that
their possession of the lots would ripen into ownership by prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The title of defendants obtained under the
Torrens System is indefeasible and no title to registered land in derogation to
that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse
possession.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Petitioners however insist that
the following allegations in the answer (to the complaint) dated September 26,
1984, prepared and filed by the same counsel for the private respondents, Atty.
Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, constitute "judicial

<blockquote>[Brief for the Petitioners, p. 8; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 94.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The phraseology used by the respondents does
not at all connote that they are acknowledging the petitioners as owners of the
demolished structures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, petitioners, as tenants of the former owner of the property which was <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span> Bank, cannot deny the title of the private
respondents which passed to the latter by virtue of the deed of absolute sale
dated <st1:date year="1984" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1984</st1:date>
[Rule 131, Section 3 (b), <span class="GramE">Revised</span> Rules of Court.]
Contrary to petitioners' stand, the negation and avoidance of warranty
contained in said deed does not refer to ownership but only to physical
possession as can be gleaned from its clear terms:<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Among the tenants listed in said annex to the deed are
petitioners Elisa Nantes, wife of <span class="SpellE">Arcangel</span> <span class="SpellE">Genoblazo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Areli</span> de
Fiesta.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A review of the records shows
that petitioners were formally notified by <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span>
Bank of the change of ownership of the subject premises in a letter which
states:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>We wish to inform you that the property which you are presently
occupying is now owned by Mr. Jaime de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and
Carmen <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Reyes in view
of the Deed of Absolute Sale which the Bank executed in favor of the new
owners.</blockquote>

February 1984 shall therefore now be paid directly to the new owners. . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Record, p. 157.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, petitioners' claim of ownership over the subject
premises was totally unfounded.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled rule that the issuance of the writ of preliminary
injunction as an ancillary or preventive remedy to secure the rights of a party
in a pending case rests upon the sound discretion of the court taking
cognizance of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The exercise of
sound judicial discretion by the lower court in injunctive matters should not
be interfered with except in case of manifest abuse [<span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>
v. Torres, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-26462, </span><st1:date year="1969" day="9" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 9, 1969</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 28 SCRA 489.]</span> Consequently, since the petitioners failed
to make a clear showing that the trial judge gravely abused that discretion in
denying the writ on the basis of her findings, the appellate court correctly
denied the petition for <i>certiorari</i> before it [Rule 65, Section 1 of the
Revised Rules of Court; <span class="SpellE">Tabil</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-46773, </span><st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 16, 1979</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,

<p class="BODY">IV<span class="GramE">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Finally</span>, petitioners' contention that
the respondent trial judge was disqualified from proceeding with the trial of
case is not well taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sole ground
for disqualification of the respondent trial judge invoked by petitioners, <u>i.e.</u>,
the alleged partiality and prejudgment of the merits of the complaint is not
among the legal grounds for disqualification enumerated under Section 1 of Rule
137 of the Revised Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Section 1.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Disqualification</u> <u>of</u> <u>judges</u>.</span>
- No judge or judicial officer shall sit in any case in which he, or his wife

<p class="BODY">While it is true that partiality and prejudgment may constitute a
just or valid reason for the trial judge to voluntarily inhibit himself from
hearing the case, it is not enough that the same be merely alleged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is now settled that mere suspicion that a
judge is partial to one of the parties to the case is not enough; there should
be evidence to prove the charge [Beltran V. Garcia, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-30868,

 1971</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 41 SCRA 158.]</span> In this case,
no such proof of partiality and prejudgment has been adduced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the trial judge acted correctly in proceeding with the
case by setting it for pre-trial since it is within her sound discretion, after
her decision in favor of her own competency, to either proceed with the trial
or refrain from acting on the case until determination of the issue of her
disqualification by the appellate court [Section 2 of Rule 137 of the Revised
Rules of Court; De la Paz v. Intermediate Appellate Court, <u>supra,</u> at
76.]</p>
