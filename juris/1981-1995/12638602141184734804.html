Appeals in C.A.-G.R. No. 03201, specifically the portion thereof granting the
respondent spouses' motion for new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="1">22 January 1979</st1:date>,
petitioner Georgia <span class="SpellE">Tumang</span> commenced action against
respondent spouses Daniel and <span class="SpellE">Haydee</span> Del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Regional</st1:placename>

City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint, docketed as Civil
Case No. 3484, alleged that petitioner was the registered owner of the
mentioned lot covered by Original Certificate of Title No. T-1289; that as an
act of accommodation for the benefit of respondent spouses <span class="SpellE">Haydee</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> and Daniel Del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span>
(who are petitioner's sister and brother-in-law, respectively), petitioner
executed two (2) deeds of sale over her nine-tenth (9/10) interest in the
property and a document confirming the sale of such interest, all of which
instruments were executed without any consideration moving from respondent
spouses to petitioner; that the accommodation was intended to enable respondent
Daniel del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span>, an employee of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue, to "puff7 up" his personal holdings so he could
comply with the government's policy requiring <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">its </span>employees to make full disclosure of all their properties;
that respondent spouses breached her trust when they had caused the
registration of the lot, and issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No.
T-27584, to include their own names as co-owners (1/10 for petitioner and 9/10
for respondent spouses); that the respondents, despite several demands, refused
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">return </span>her property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent spouses, in their answer, contended that the deeds of
sale were not without any consideration; that since the execution of the
questioned documents, they have been in possession of the land and been paying
realty taxes thereon; that it was petitioner who had formally requested the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City to cancel her title
and to issue another and new title in their (petitioner and respondent spouses)
names. Respondents filed a counterclaim for damages.</p>

receipts signed by petitioner apparently showing that she had received various
sums of money <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P69,992.00 from respondent

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's subsequent motion for reconsideration of the above
resolution was denied for lack of merit in a minute resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="4" month="2">4 February 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that respondent Court of Appeals erred in
regarding the receipts as "newly discovered evidence" and in allowing
new <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">trial </span>on this ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for new trial upon the ground of newly discovered
evidence, is properly granted where there is concurrence of the following
requisites, namely: a) the evidence had been discovered after trial; b) the evidence
could not have been discovered and produced during trial even with the exercise
of reasonable diligence; and c) the evidence is material, and not merely
corroborative, cumulative, or impeaching and is of such weight that if
admitted, would probably alter the result.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner does not dispute that the receipts which respondents
intend to submit as new evidence were found subsequent to the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, however, chiefly argues that the
receipts do not constitute newly discovered evidence but are merely
"forgotten evidence," being already in existence during trial and
which could have been discovered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
there presented by the respondents had they exercised due diligence in
searching for such receipts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Newly discovered
evidence, under prevailing jurisprudence, need not be newly created evidence;
newly discovered evidence, in other words may and does commonly refer to
evidence already in existence prior or during the trial but which could not
have been secured and presented during the trial despite reasonable diligence
on the part of the litigant offering it or his counsel.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

limited to evidence which, though already in existence before or during trial
was <u>not</u> known to the offering litigant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So-called "forgotten" evidence may, upon the other hand, be
seen to refer to evidence already in existence or available before or during
trial, which was known to and obtainable by the party offering it and,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> which could have been presented and offered
in a seasonable manner were it not for the oversight or forgetfulness of such
party or his counsel.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In order that a
particular piece of evidence may be properly regarded as "newly
discovered" for purposes of a grant of new trial, what is essential is not
so much the time when the evidence offered first sprang into existence nor the
time when it first came to the knowledge of the party now submitting it: what
is essential </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rather, that the offering party had exercised
reasonable diligence in seeking to locate such evidence before or</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">during
trial but had nonetheless failed to secure it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, a party who, prior to the trial had, no means of knowing that a
specific piece of evidence existed and was in fact obtainable, can scarcely be
charged with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lack of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">diligence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is commonplace to observe that the term "diligence" is a
relative </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">variable one, not capable of exact definition
and the contents of which must depend entirely on the particular configuration
of facts obtaining in each case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar, the
receipts which the Court of Appeals considered newly discovered evidence were
found by respondent Daniel del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span>, according to
his affidavit of merit attached to the Motion for Reconsideration and for New
Trial.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> on 4 October 1986 in their residence </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">at No. 3905 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Marigold Road, <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, Metro Manila, when,
in the course of "a general cleaning and re-arrangement" of their
house necessitated by floods caused by heavy rains, he happened to look into an
old desk in his "study cubicle." He sorted out various items "such
as old cards, letters, memorabilia, pamphlets, brochures, and similar
miscellaneous things accumulated through the years." He found in "the
bottom back portion of a drawer in said desk an old envelope containing </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">bunch of documents" among which, it turned out, were the receipts
issued by petitioner Dr. Georgia <span class="SpellE">Tumang</span> to respondent
spouses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter had "believed
these receipts to have been lost and no longer existing," having been
unable, to locate them "despite diligent effort(s) to search all documents
and files in our possession."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We agree with the Court
of Appeals that the receipts submitted by the respondent spouses are properly
regarded as newly discovered evidence warranting the grant of a new trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The receipts, previously thought lost and
gone forever and found in the "bottom back portion" of a drawer in an
old and unused desk, could hardly have been located with the exercise of
average or reasonable diligence; indeed, it was in the course of a
"general (house) cleaning and re-arrangement" of the respondents'
house that they were found once again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is what the Court of Appeals in effect held.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We think that the respondent spouses'
explanation has the ring of truth; it certainly is entirely plausible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems quite reasonable to assume that the
respondents would have exerted all efforts to locate the receipts earlier; it
was clearly in their interest and to their advantage to have presented them
during the trial had they in </span>fact been effectively available <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to them at that time, since </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">receipts appear to contradict petitioner's
express denial of receipt of any money in connection with the transfer of </span>9/10
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her interest in the property
involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The receipts also appear to
support respondent spouses' defense that the three </span>(3) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">documents nullified by the trial court were
not simulated merely to avoid possible anti-corruption charges against
respondent Daniel del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span> but had in fact been
executed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The receipts are, in other words, apparently of such import that a
reasonably prudent man would have most diligently searched for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is no question then
that the receipts involved are material and relevant to the issue of lack of
consideration, and could possibly effect a change in the result reached by the
trial court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Finally, we note that the
grant or denial of a new trial is generally speaking addressed to the sound
discretion of the court, </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">discretion
which cannot be interfered with unless a clear abuse thereof is shown.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Petitioner has not shown such an abuse here.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On the contrary, it appears to us that
the interests of substantial justice would best be served by remanding, as the
Court of Appeals did, the case to the trial court for a new trial, where the
precise import of the receipts may be litigated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner does not dispute the authenticity
of her signature on the receipts; however, </span>she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">argues that, the moneys receipted for were only received "in
trust" for the maintenance and educational expenses of respondents'
children who were then attending school in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Baguio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
question of whether the sums of money were actually received "in

13.0pt">payment for the sale of the property involved, can only be properly
threshed out in a new trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
