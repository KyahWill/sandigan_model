				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The application of the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> is the main issue in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The secondary issue is whether or not a case
involving the civil status of a person should first be referred to the
appropriate <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> officials for possible
settlement in accordance with the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
arbitration law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lourdes S. Flores <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>the
natural mother of <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span>
who was born on <st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On March 13, 1981, she filed a complaint for
support against Gil C. <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span> in the then Court of
First Instance of San Pablo City, alleging, among others, that she once served
as a domestic helper of Gil during which time they had sexual relations and
that as a consequence thereof, she begot a son, <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span>;
that the latter's birth was not recorded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in
</span>the local civil registrar's office due to inadvertence; that for four
years <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">since </span>the birth of the
child, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">she </span>was given a weekly
allowance of P10.00 to cover expenses for milk; that she was given an allowance
of P15.00 a month for her own maintenance until the child graduated from
elementary school; that the said allowance was increased to P20.00 a month
until September, 1980; that thereafter, she had to wash clothes for other
people in order to survive s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">o </span>she
became sickly; and that she needed a monthly allowance of P500.00 for the
support and education of the child, and an additional sum of P200.00 monthly
for support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>,
as well as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the parties eventually filed a joint motion to dismiss
alleging:</p>

<blockquote>1) That plaintiff has decided to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span>withdraw her complaint or to cause the dismissal of the same
against the defendant, for the reason that after pondering about the matter for
a considerable length of time, she now seriously doubts that the said defendant
is the person with whom she had her child named <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) That by reason, thereof, Article 283 of the New Civil Code is
not applicable to the herein plaintiff and the defendant and to the above-named
child of the plaintiff, hence, plaintiff is no longer interested to prosecute
this case;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3) That the parties hereto waive and forego any and all their other
claims and counter-claims under their complaint and answer, respectively.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion was granted in an order of the Regional Trial Court in
<st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
dated <st1:date year="1983" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was dismissed with prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1987</st1:date>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city> filed a motion for leave of
court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>the same case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for </span><span class="SpellE">Angelito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span> to continue and revive the case for support
inasmuch as he had already attained the age of majority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said motion was denied on <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two motions for the reconsideration of the
order of denial were also denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1987</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> filed in the same court a complaint for
support and declaration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>his
status as natural child of Gil C. <span class="SpellE">Maglalang</span> with hereditary
rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion to dismiss the
complaint on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">judicata</span></u></span>
and for lack of cause of action was filed by Gil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion to dismiss was granted by the
trial court in an order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="6">June 2,
 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Angelito</span>
elevated the case to the Court of Appeals wherein in due course a decision was
rendered on <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1988</st1:date>
affirming the appealed order.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
A motion for reconsideration filed by <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> was
denied on <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 11.0pt">August 5, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the herein petition the primordial issue being is whether
or not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
has set in.</p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original
action for support for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> filed by
his mother, Lourdes Flores, is predicated on the claim that Gil is the natural
father of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in the
joint motion to dismiss signed by Gil and Lourdes as well as their counsels, it
is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>categorically stated that she
seriously doubts that <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> is the son of Gil, so
that Article 283 of the Civil Code is not applicable; that she was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">no </span>longer interested in prosecuting the
case; and that they were waiving any claim or counterclaim against each
other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As above-stated, the case was
dismissed with prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed the complaint for support and
acknowledgment as a natural child against Gil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He alleges that the cause of action in his complaint is different from
the one in the first complaint and that there is no identity of parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it may
be true that in the first case the ostensible cause of action is for support
while in the second suit it is for support and acknowledgement as a natural
child, there can be no question that the causes of action in both cases are the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier observed, before
petitioner may be afforded support, it must be established that the petitioner
is the natural child of Gil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same
evidence is required in both cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, even considering that the plaintiff in the
first case was <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>, she
litigated not only in her own behalf but also in representation of her minor
child, the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, there
is identity of parties in the two cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the questioned order of dismissal with prejudice issued by
the trial court, which order had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
amounts to <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
which bars the prosecution of any similar case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
By virtue of the said order, the issue of the alleged <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Angelito</span> had been put to rest when <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>
admitted that Gil is not the father of petitioner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">No rule is more settled in this jurisdiction than that there is <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> when
the following requisites are present -</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>the judgment or order must be final;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>the court rendering it must have jurisdiction over the subject matter
and of the parties;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>that it must be a judgment on the merits; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that
there must be identity of parties, identity of subject matter and identity of
cause of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other issue relating to prior resort to <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
arbitration proceedings as a pre-condition to the filing of a complaint before
the court can be resolved by a cursory examination of Section 6 of Presidential
Decree No. 1508, the law on <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> arbitration, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Conciliation,
pre-condition to filing of complaint</u>.- No complaint, petition, action or
proceeding involving any matter within the authority of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lupon</u></span>
as provided in Section 2 hereof shall be filed or instituted in court or any
other government office for adjudication unless there has been a confrontation
of the parties before the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lupon</u></span> Chairman or
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Pangkat</u></span> and no conciliation or settlement
has been reached as certified by the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lupon</u></span>
Secretary or the <span class="SpellE"><u>Pangkat</u></span> Secretary, attested
by the <span class="SpellE">Lupon</span> or <span class="SpellE">Pangkat</span>
Chairman or unless the settlement has been repudiated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the parties may go directly to court
in the following cases:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">(1) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Where the accused is
under detention;</p>

<p class="2Q">(2) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Where a person has
otherwise been deprived of personal liberty calling for habeas corpus
proceedings;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt">(3) Actions coupled
with provisional remedies such as preliminary injunction, attachment, delivery
of personal property, and support <span class="SpellE">pendente</span> <span class="SpellE">lite</span>; and</p>

<p class="2Q">4) <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Where the action may
otherwise be barred by the Statute of Limitations."</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is clear that a case involving the civil
status of a person <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., the acknowledgment of a natural child is
not among the cases where prior resort to <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
arbitration is not necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason
is obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The possibility of
settlement at this level is encouraged even in such cases before the issue is
brought to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More so when there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">is </span>cogent basis for the civil status being sought to be
established.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the requirement of prior resort to <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> arbitration was not satisfied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the dismissal of the case for lack of
cause of action is called for.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
