the said petition for <i>certiorari</i> therein for lack of merit.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant petition with the
following submissions which allegedly warrant our review of the assailed
decision, viz.:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred when it ruled that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed with it was
not the proper remedy to assail the questioned orders and judgment by default
rendered by the respondent judge;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

erred when it found that <i>certiorari</i> was availed of by petitioner MERALCO
only after its right to appeal had lapsed into finality; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
not only departed from the usual course of proceeding, but also decided
questions of substance contrary to law and the applicable decisions of this
Honorable Court, when it refused to issue the equitable writ of <i>certiorari</i>
to correct the palpable grave abuse of discretion committed by the respondent
judge in issuing the questioned orders and judgment by default.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a careful consideration of the issues <span class="GramE">raised</span>,
which we shall rule upon conjointly, we find the petition devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> may be
availed of in the alternative situation where an appeal would not constitute a
plain, speedy and adequate remedy, this is on the theoretical assumption that
the right to appeal is still available in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, however, the remedy by appeal had already
been lost and the loss was occasioned by petitioner's own neglect or error in
the choice of remedies, <i>certiorari</i> cannot lie as a substitute or <span style="">a </span>tool to
shield the petitioner from the adverse consequences of such neglect or
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two remedies are mutually
exclusive and not alternative or successive.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applying this fundamental principle to the case at bar, it is
readily evident that petitioner had ample opportunities to appeal the default
judgment rendered against it by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, to wit, after
the default judgment itself was rendered and, later, after its motion to lift
the order of default and to vacate the default judgment was denied by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It nevertheless deliberately
allowed the period for appeal to pass without interposing one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, despite the then availability of the
remaining period for appeal from the denial of its motion to lift the order of
default and to vacate the default judgment, it opted to wait and subsequently
file a petition for relief from the judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
which by then was final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, with the added
misfortune that said petition could not claim any procedural validity both
technically and on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> technical grounds, it
is a firmly established doctrine that the relief provided for by Rule 38 of the
Rules of Court is of equitable character and <span style="">is </span>allowed only in exceptional cases, that <span style="">is, </span>where there is no other available
or adequate remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A petition for
relief is not regarded with favor and judgment will not be disturbed where the
party complaining has, or by exercising proper diligence would <span style="">have had, an adequate remedy at law,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as in the present case where petitioner
could have proceeded by appeal to vacate or modify the default judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is no creditable
argument that petitioner supposedly preferred respondent judge to correct her
own alleged errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a special
remedy, a petition for relief is available only under exceptional </span>circumstances,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">in which equity and justice will prompt
the court to give the petitioner a last chance to defend his right or to
protect his interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even so, the
relief will not be granted to a party, like the petitioner, when the loss of
remedy at law was due to his own negligence or a mistaken mode of procedure,
otherwise, the petition for relief </span>will <span style="">be tantamount </span>to <span style="">reviving
the right of appeal which had already been lost.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the merits of the
petition for relief, we likewise do not find excusable the failure of
petitioner's counsel to attend the pre-trial hearing as to justify the grant of
relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of record that petitioner
was represented in the case below by a number of readily available lawyers
belonging to its own legal department who could have easily been sent to attend
the pre-trial conference or, at the very least, to move for its postponement if
they were not prepared for such hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, however, utterly failed to comply with the rules to protect
its interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the patent
lack of coordination among or the cavalier response of the members of its own
legal staff, despite due notice of the pre-trial conference, cannot exculpate
petitioner from the adverse consequences of the default judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As aptly revealed by
private respondent in its comment to the basic petition:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the instant case, petitioner is represented by a battery
of lawyers headed by Attys. Gerardo R. Gonzales, Amador B. <span class="SpellE">Factura</span>,
Vicente M. Montero and Romeo M. Flores.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These lawyers appear as counsel on record for petitioner as shown no
less in page 21 of the Answer (Annex ‘M’ of Annex ‘D’, Petition) and page 12 of
the Opposition to Injunction (Annex ‘K’ of Annex ‘D’, Petition).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If indeed Atty. Romeo M. Flores was sick of influenza, one of
the lawyers aforementioned should have had the decency to appear at the
pre-trial <u>even</u> <u>just</u> <u>to</u> <u>reset</u> the same if such be
their pleasure, but certainly not to snub the Honorable Court, for such an
actuation would further aggravate the seeming disrespect that some lawyers have
for court orders.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner and counsel were notified of the pre-trial
setting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They knew that they did not
attend the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good judgment and due
diligence would have dictated that petitioner's counsel (a battery of them)
should have called up or visited the Court to inquire as to what transpired
during the pre-trial, which move they did not do through sheer gross negligence
and apathy. ‘The standard of care required of a defendant is that which<span style=""> </span>an ordinary prudent man bestows upon
his important business.' (Gaylord vs. <st1:state><st1:place>Berry</st1:place></st1:state>,
169 N.C. 733, 86 SE 623)</blockquote>

<span style="">Annex '2</span>' of petitioner's motion
to lift (Annex 'P' of Annex 'D', Petition) which is the medical consultation
slip issued by Dr. Rogelio Sanchez of the J. F. Cotton Hospital (the hospital
of <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> located at the back of their main building
in the same company compound), reveals that as early as April 27, 1988, Atty.
Romeo Flores <u>already</u> <u>knew</u> that he was to be confined at home for
such was the advice of the company doctor:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Advice:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for house <span style="">confinement </span>and to report back to J<span style="">. F. </span>Cotton

(one of petitioner's counsel) should have gone back to his <u>office</u> <u>which</u>
<u>is</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>compound</u> <u>or</u> <u>called</u>
<u>up</u> <u>his</u> <u>office</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>doctor's</u> <u>office</u><span style=""> <u>by</u> </span><u>intercom</u> (local
station) and advised the legal staff or his secretary of his situation so that
the legal office could have sent the other lawyers (as appearing in the
pleadings) to attend and postpone the pre-trial to be held the next day, April
28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For petitioner's Atty. Flores to
claim now that he did not have the means to communicate with his legal staff is
purely an afterthought designed merely as a subterfuge to escape the
consequences of his negligence as was his feigned illness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the
hospital (J. F. Cotton) where Atty. Flores had his check-up is a company

<span class="GramE">(Underscoring in the original).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not arguable that
negligence of counsel is binding on the client, just as the latter is bound by
the mistakes of his lawyer.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This is especially true in petitioner's case

<p class="BODY">With regard to petitioner's contention that the order declaring
it in default is a nullity due to its lack of notice of the pre-trial hearing,
the findings of fact both of the trial court and the respondent court, which
are conclusive upon us there being absent any showing of grave abuse of
discretion in the appreciation of such facts, belie such contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Says the trial court on this issue:</p>

one for defendant Manila Electric Company and another <span style="">to Atty. Flores.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The enclosure

the party through or care of his counsel at counsel's address, with the express
imposition upon counsel of the obligation of notifying the party of the date,
time and place of the pre-trial conference and assuring that the party either
appear thereat or deliver to counsel a written authority to represent the party
with power to compromise the case, with the warning that a party who fails to
do so may be non-suited or declared (as) in default.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

upon and courts are encouraged as much as possible to hear cases and determine
them on the merits; and that the rules of procedure ought not to be applied in
a very rigid, technical sense but should be used to help secure and not to
override substantial justice, this does not mean that a party may, by any
remedy it chooses to pursue and at any time it decides to do so, expect to
obtain a desired favorable result, in this case the nullification of the
default order or the setting aside of the default judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, a proper and timely
challenge is a requisite provided by the rules and compliance therewith is
essential for the orderly and expedient administration of justice for which
said rules, in the first place, were primarily framed and prescribed.</p>
