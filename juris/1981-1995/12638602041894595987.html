				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Does the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) have
jurisdiction to resolve a claim for non-payment of stock subscriptions to a
corporation? Assuming that it has, can an obligation arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> be offset against a money claim of an employee
against the employer? These are the issues brought to this court through this
petition for review of a decision of the NLRC dated <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only remedy provided for by law from such a decision is a
special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court
based on jurisdictional grounds or on alleged grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, not by way of an appeal by <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, in the interest of justice,
this petition is treated as a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was employed in respondent corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="8">August
 28, 1985</st1:date>, respondent Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>
persuaded petitioner to subscribe to 1,500 shares of respondent corporation at
P100.00 per share or a total of P150,000.00. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>He made an initial payment of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">P37,500.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner was appointed President and General Manager of the respondent
corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1986</st1:date>, he resigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioner instituted with the NLRC a complaint against private respondents for
the payment of his unpaid wages, his cost of living allowance, the balance of
his gasoline and representation expenses and his bonus compensation for
1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner and private respondents
submitted their position papers to the labor arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents admitted that there is
due to petitioner the amount of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> P</span>17,060.07
but this was applied to the unpaid balance of his subscription in the amount of
P95,439.93.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner questioned the
set- off alleging that there was no call or notice for the payment of the
unpaid subscription <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and<b> </b></span>that,
accordingly, the alleged obligation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is n</span>ot
enforceable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="4">April
 28, 1987</st1:date>, the labor arbiter sustained the claim of petitioner for
P17,060.07 on the ground that the employer has no right to withhold payment of
wages already earned under Article 103 of the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the appeal of the private respondents to
public respondent NLRC, the decision of the labor arbiter was reversed in a
decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC held that a stockholder who fails to
pay his unpaid subscription on call becomes a debtor of the corporation and
that the set-off of said obligation against the wages and others due to
petitioner is not contrary to law, morals and public policy.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, the NLRC has no jurisdiction to determine such
intra-corporate dispute between the stockholder and the corporation as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>the m<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">atter </span>of unpaid subscriptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This controversy is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, assuming <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">arguendo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>that
the NLRC may exercise jurisdiction over the said subject matter under the
circumstances of this case, the unpaid subscriptions are not due and payable
until a call is made by the corporation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for
payment.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>Private respondents have not
presented a resolution of the board of directors of respondent corporation
calling for the payment of the unpaid subscriptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not even appear that a notice of such
call has been sent to petitioner by the respondent corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>records show is
that the respondent corporation deducted the amount due to petitioner from the
amount receivable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">from him </span>for
the unpaid subscriptions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
No doubt such set-off was without lawful basis, if not premature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As there was no notice or call for the
payment of unpaid subscriptions, the same is not yet due and payable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, assuming further that there was a call for payment of the
unpaid subscription, the NLRC cannot validly set it off against the wages and
other benefits due petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article
113 of the Labor Code allows such a deduction from the wages of the employees
by the employer, only in three instances, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 113.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Wage Deduction</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">.- </span>No employer, in his own behalf or in
behalf of any person, shall make any deduction from the wages of his employees,
except:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cases where the
worker is insured with his consent by the employer, and the deduction is to

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For union dues, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>cases where the right of the worker

in writing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by the </span>individual
worker concerned; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In cases where the employer
