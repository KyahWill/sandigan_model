do you plead?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>I plead g<span style="">uilty</span></u><span style="">, </span>your

her money and it was on nighttime and you disregarded of her being a
woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is one aggravating
(circumstance) and the Court has no recourse but to impose death although I am
not willing to give it to you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do you
admit that?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">No, sir.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Abes</span>,
70, a neighbor of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Llantada</span>, testified that in
the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1979</st1:date>
he met her on the highway near the camp of De la Riva.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Lebajo</span>
and Armando <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Abes</span> pointed in court to a person with a
harelip who turned out to be <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eugenia <span class="SpellE">Petos</span>, a resident of <span class="SpellE">Oquendo</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, testified that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1979</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Lebajo</span>
and two persons, one of whom had a harelip, appeared in her store and wanted to
buy food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there was no food, they
just drank water.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three appeared to be panicky or frightened and were out of
breath. After drinking water, they left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worried that there was something wrong, <span class="SpellE">Petos</span>
closed her store.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Zacarias</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Daguman</span>, also a
resident of <span class="SpellE">Oquendo</span>, saw <span class="SpellE">Lebajo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span> eating in a restaurant that same evening
of </span><st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="5"><span style="">May 19, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They looked worried and fidgety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fiscal had filed a motion to discharge <span class="SpellE">Lebajo</span>
so that he could be utilized as a State witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It regarded as unnecessary <span class="SpellE">Lebajo's</span> presentation as a witness because of <span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span> plea of guilty (37 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1980</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court subsequently dismissed the
case against <span class="SpellE">Lebajo</span> for lack of evidence (pp. 82-83,
Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in convicting <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span>
reasoned out that his <u>second plea of guilty</u>, which superseded his prior
plea of not guilty, cured the defects of his extrajudicial confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span> did not
testify at the trial and did not appeal from the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">His learned and able counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>,
designated to present his side in this review of the death penalty, contends
that the trial court erred in accepting <span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span>
plea of guilty, in lieu of his prior plea of not guilty, because it did not
ascertain whether he had grasped fully the meaning and consequences of his
plea.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General agrees with the counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> that <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span> had
made an improvement plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court was justified in convicting the
accused on the basis of his <u>second plea of guilty</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the transcript of the stenographic notes for the hearing
on <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1980</st1:date> does not
reveal how <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span> withdrew the plea of not guilty
entered for him by the trial court at the hearing on <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1979</st1:date> and substituted it with his
second plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">That omission was the fault of the stenographer, not of the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated earlier, the minutes of
the hearing prepared by the clerk of court unquestionably prove that <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span> entered a plea of guilty to replace his previous
plea of not guilty (p. 69, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in its decision dictated in open court made
repeated references to <span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span> second plea of
guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If no such plea had been made,
as intimated by counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> and
the Solicitor General, then <span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span> counsel would
have called the trial judge's attention to that discrepancy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also true that the prosecution's oral evidence, which was
received after the plea of guilty was made, does not prove <span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span>
guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has very little probative
value.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the <span style="">other </span>hand,
as already adverted to, the extrajudicial confession, which was identified by
the police investigator, is not admissible under the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, it should be underscored that at <span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span> first arraignment on <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1979</st1:date>, when the trial court,
following the recurring admonition of this Court to trial judges in capital
cases, interrogated him, he freely and spontaneously pleaded guilty with the
assistance of his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Aside from
pleading guilty, he admitted having killed and robbed Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Llantada</span>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is significant that that admission was a
confession of guilt which was distinct from his plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">To all indications, he was aware of the consequences of his
judicial admission of the killing and robbery on the national highway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span> separate
and voluntary admission of guilt, made in open court, when he was assisted by
counsel and was not acting under duress or cajolery, is conclusive as to his
guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, that judicial confession was rendered inoperative when
moments later during the arraignment in the course of judicial interrogation, <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span> said that he confessed because he was
maltreated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that juncture, the trial
court entered a plea of not guilty for him, a plea which <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span>
confirmed and which cancelled his plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">But four months later, <span class="SpellE">MatiIla</span>, before
trial, was re-arraigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
re-arraignment, he withdrew his plea of not guilty and restored his original
plea of guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span> <u>second plea of guilty</u>
automatically revived his judicial confession of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly rationalized by the trial court,
his second plea of guilty validated his extrajudicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It</span> removed any reasonable doubt as to his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">In retrospect, it would appear that <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span>
withdrew his original plea of guilty because it was impressed upon him by the
trial court that his <u>mea</u> <u>culpa</u> would result in his electrocution.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it is clear that when he withdrew his plea of not guilty and
substituted it with a plea of guilty, he was fully cognizant of the grave
consequences of that second plea of guilty because he made the withdrawal long
after he had pleaded not guilty and after the fiscal had repeatedly refused to
accede to his request that the charge be changed to murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed by <span class="SpellE">Matilla</span> is
highway robbery with homicide penalized with death as a single indivisible
penalty under the aforementioned Presidential Decree No. 532 which provides:</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 of Presidential Decree No. 532 repealed pertinent
portions of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Matilla's</span> plea of guilty has no effect
on the death penalty which is imposable upon him (Art. 63, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the trial court did not err in imposing the death
penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the requisite ten
