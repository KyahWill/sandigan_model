				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On April 7, 1986, <span class="SpellE">Librado</span> Vargas was
recruited by the petitioner, GRF Shipping Agency, Inc., to work as a third
engineer, with a monthly salary of $615, on board the M/V 'Barbara Morgan,' a
vessel of <span class="SpellE">Chaldeos</span> Freighters Ltd.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1987</st1:date>,
while the ship was on its way to <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Cuiota</span></st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Morocco</st1:country-region></st1:place>, Vargas felt
severe pain in the region of his previous hernia operation, apparently caused
by excessive physical exertion on his part while calibrating the main engine
injection valve of the ship, a task which ordinarily would have required at
least two or more persons to perform.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was given first aid treatment and when the ship arrived in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Tunisia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
he was examined by a Tunisian doctor, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rekik</span> <span class="SpellE">Abbdellatif</span>, who found that he was suffering from hernia,
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">recommended his immediate
repatriation </span>for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">further </span>treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the ship captain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">advised him to wait </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">for </span>the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> or his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">representative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1987</st1:date>,
Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Sabat</span>, the recruiter's representative,
arrived in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Tunisia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">He </span>was
notified of Vargas’ illness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1987</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Sabat</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">brought Vargas to the same Tunisian
doctor who had </span>earlier examined him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The doctor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">affirmed his previous
diagnosis that Vargas was suffering from hernia and </span>recommended his
immediate repatriation to the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>He
issued another medical certificate to that effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the doctor's advice, <span class="SpellE">Sabat</span>
wanted Vargas to await the ship's arrival in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
which would take about two months <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>navigation, as repatriation was allegedly
not allowed by the laws of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Tunisia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Vargas sought the help of the ship's agent who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">brought the matter to the attention of the Port Authority in </span><st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Spax</span></span></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span><st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Tunisia</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was thereafter allowed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">by </span><span class="SpellE">Sabat</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">to </span>be repatriated and he was advised <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to </span>draw his salary for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">February,
1987, from the petitioner upon his arrival in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon his arrival in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Vargas was brought for treatment to the company's doctor, a certain Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
treated at the <st1:place><st1:placename>FEU</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
until he recovered from his illness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr.
<span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> opined that Vargas suffered from Spermatic
Cord Infection, a disease not subject to repatriation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the petitioner deducted from
Vargas' February salary the sum of P9<span class="GramE">,704.90</span> for the
medical expenses defrayed by the petitioner, and P5,300.00 from his salaries for
June and August, 1986.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1987</st1:date>,
Vargas filed a complaint for non-payment of wages, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">illegal </span>deductions, and unpaid medical benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1988</st1:date>,
the POEA rendered a decision allowing his claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, judgment is hereby
rendered ordering as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Payment by respondent GRF Shipping Agency unto the
complainant the following:<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="2Q">“3<span class="GramE">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>US</span>$615.00

 April 1987</st1:date>; and</p>

<p class="2Q">“4<span class="GramE">. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>P3,000.00</span>
as and for attorney's fees, to be tendered thru this office within ten (10)
days from receipt hereof." <span class="GramE">(pp. 31-32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed to the National Labor Relations
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1990</st1:date>, the NLRC dismissed the
appeal, and affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the <span class="SpellE">POEA's</span> decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised by the petition is whether or not the NLRC
gravely abused its discretion in finding that, as certified by the Tunisian
doctor, Vargas’ ailment was hernia (which is a cause for repatriation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the employee) and not spermatic
cord infection, as found by the petitioner's Manila doctor, which is not a
ground for repatriation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a
factual question which is for the public respondents, as <span class="SpellE">triers</span>
of fact, to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">determine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Well settled is the rule that factual
findings of quasi-judicial agencies like the National Labor Relations
Commission, which have acquired expertise because their jurisdiction is
confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not only respect but at
times even finality if such findings are supported by substantial evidence."
(Baby Bus, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Inc. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">vs. Minister of Labor, 158 SCRA 221.) The
NLRC correctly observed that the medical certificate issued </span>by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the petitioner's own physician was
self-serving evidence. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>As such, its
probative value is inferior compared with the medical certificate issued in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Tunisia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> by an impartial foreign doctor in the
presence of petitioner's own representative who did not question its veracity
and authenticity at the time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is dismissed
for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
