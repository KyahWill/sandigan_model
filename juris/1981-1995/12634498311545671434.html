				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a special civil
action of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> complaining of the Order dated
October 1, 1980 as well as the </span><span style="">Order
</span><span style="">dated December </span>1, 1980 <span style="">of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>, Branch XXXIX, as having been issued with grave abuse
of discretion, the first Order recalling the writ of execution issued on </span>June
<span style="">18, </span><span style="">1980 </span><span style="">in Civil Case No.
7222-P, entitled "Philippine Holding Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
Figueroa" and the second Order denying the motion for reconsideration
filed by herein petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
prays to compel respondent Judge to order immediate execution of the judgment
of eviction and to issue the corresponding writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction for the purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court hereby </span>sets
<span style="">aside the two orders and grants the
writ of <i>mandamus</i> prayed for, since the said orders were issued in
violation of the specific and mandatory provisions of Section </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">Rule </span>70 <span style="">of the Rules of
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For a brief statement of
the undisputed facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a decision dated
October </span>17, <span style="">1978 of the City </span><span style="">Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>,
Branch IV, respondent <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> Figueroa was ordered
evicted from the premises owned by petitioner corporation located at 1400 <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Boulevard corner <span class="SpellE">Salud</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City by virtue of the expiration of the
contract of lease thereon between said respondent as lessee and herein
petitioner as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For un­explained reasons, petitioner did not receive a copy of the
decision until after it filed, on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="1"><span style="">January 15, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, a motion for the early decision of the case
and City Judge Francisco Llamas issued an order that a copy of the decision be
sent to petitioner's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surprisingly also, respondent Figueroa received a copy of the decision
only much later on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="3"><span style="">March 5, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After respondent's motion for reconsideration of the deci­sion of
eviction had been denied, the City Court issued the corresponding writ of
execution on petitioner's motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1979</st1:date>,
respondent Figueroa filed a notice of appeal dated <st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1979</st1:date> from the decision of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City Court and at the same time filed a <span class="SpellE"><u>supersedeas</u></span>
bond consisting of a first lien or mortgage executed in favor of petitioner
over two parcels of land located at <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>, La Union.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Court of First Instance, after respondent failed to
deposit the monthly rentals that had fallen due since the perfection of the
appeal, petitioner moved for execution on <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="2">Februa­ry 12, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was reiterated on <st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="5">May 13,
 1980</st1:date> and again on <st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="6">June 13,
 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1980</st1:date>, respondent Judge
granted the motion and ordered execution of the lower court's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="7">July
 23, 1980</st1:date>, respondent, on his own behalf, filed an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> Motion to Recall Writ of Execution Pending
Appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, or on <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1980</st1:date>, respondent Judge
issued an order suspending the writ of execution and thereafter recalled the
same on <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1980</st1:date>,
reasoning thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court ordered the execution of the appealed decision on
the ground that the defendant failed to pay or deposit the current monthly
rental of the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon review of
the motion to recall writ of execution, the Court noted that the defendant, to
stay execution, offered real estate property the value of which, according to
defend­ant, is more than sufficient to cover up the money judgment as well as
current and future monthly rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the firm and honest belief that this property is sufficient to pay the current
monthly rentals, the defendant did not anymore pay the same in Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant is offering another parcel of
land situated in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> to answer for the current
monthly rentals.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">The Court, although aware
of the mandatory provisions of Sec. </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">Rule 70, Revised
Rules of Court, deems it a wiser policy and a more sound exercise of discretion
to liberalize its application in the interest of justice and equity."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied, the
instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> was filed wherein
petitioner submits that respondent judge's Order dated October 1, <span style="">1980 </span>recalling the writ of execution <span style="">previously </span>issued in the case and
Order dated December 1, 1980 <span style="">denying </span>its
<span style="">motion </span>for reconsideration were
issued with grave abuse of dis­cretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner accordingly
prays that <i>mandamus</i> issue to com<span style="">p</span>el
respondent Judge to perform his ministerial duty of ordering immediate
execution of the lower court's decision of eviction against respondent for
non-payment of rentals falling due during respondent's appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent Judge, while
admitting in his questioned Order that the provisions of Section </span><span style="">8, </span><span style="">Rule 70 of the Revised Rules of Court are mandatory, recalled the writ
of execution because he "deems it a wiser policy and more sound exercise
of discre­tion to liberalize its application in the interest of justice and
equity." This is patently grave abuse of discretion and officiousness on
the part of respondent Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section <span style="">8, </span>Rule 70
of the Rules of Court <span class="SpellE">mandatorily</span> pro­vides that in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases, "if judgment is rendered against the
defendant, execution shall issue immediately, unless an appeal has been
perfected and the defendant to stay execution files a sufficient bond, approved
by the municipal or city court and executed to the plaintiff to enter the
action in the Court of First Instance and to pay the rents, damages, and costs
accruing down to the time of the judgment appealed from, <u>and </u><u><span style="">unless, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the appeal, he deposits with the appellate court the amount of rent due from
time to time under the contract</span></u><span style="">,
</span><span style="">if any, as found by the judgment
of the municipal or city court to exist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of a contract, he shall deposit with the court the
reasonable value of the use and occupation of the premises for the preceding
month or period at the rate determined by the judgment, </span><u><span style="">on or before the tenth </span></u><u><span style="">day of each succeeding month or period.</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The law is explicit and is beyond respondent Judge's dis­cretion
or notion of what would be a "wiser policy." In a case where the
defendant in an eviction case did not file a <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">super­</span>sedeas</u></span> bond or, <span style="">as </span>in the case at bar, did not make
any monthly deposit of the rentals, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, like
petitioner in the case at bar, is entitled as a matter of right to the
immediate execution of the municipal or city court's judgment for the restor­ation
of possession and the payment of the accrued rentals or compensation for the
use and occupation of the premises.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In <span style="">such cases, execution is mandatory.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The only exceptions are the existence of
fraud, accident, mistake or excusable </span><span style="">negligence </span><span style="">which
prevented the defendant from posting the </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">supersedeas</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">bond
or making the monthly deposit, or the occurrence of super­vening events which
brought about a material change in the situation of the parties and which would
make the execution inequitable</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> - none of which holds in the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When the <span class="SpellE"><u>supersedeas</u></span> bond is not
filed or the current rents are not deposited with the court as required by the
cited Rule, the duty of the court to order the immediate execution of the
appealed decision is ministerial and imperative.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The mere offer of additional bond by respondent in lieu of the
required monthly deposit of rentals does not justify the recall of the writ of
execution already issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For when the
judgment in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case is appealed, the stay
of the execu­tion is conditioned upon the monthly payment to plaintiff or
deposit in court of the accruing rentals or compensation for the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the defendant-lessee to make
cash deposits for current rentals calls for immediate execution of the
judgment, even if the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">supersedeas</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>bond
filed covers both the back rents and current rents<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and the Court of First Ins­tance has <u><span style="">no
discretion</span></u><span style=""> </span>in the
matter and <u><span style="">no power</span></u><span style=""> </span>to extend the time for making such
payment.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It has long been settled that the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">supersedeas</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>bond
answers only for the rents or damages down to the time of the perfection of the
appeal and not for the future rents or damages arising during the appeal, which
rents are guaranteed to be covered by the monthly cash deposits required by the
Rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance has no
authority to accept a bond in lieu of cash deposit for future rents.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>
