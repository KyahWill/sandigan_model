<p class="BODY">The facts, as summarized by the trial court, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
last August 3, 1978, approximately 9:15 o'clock in the evening, the victim,
Alexander Mantilla, as incumbent <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Councilman
and a Ronda Member of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Consuelo, General Luna,
<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte, while performing his official
duties, was at the billiard hall of accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>,
together with the following persons, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ruirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Teraytay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sunico</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aureliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacanor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Segundiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacanor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Minglana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> <span class="SpellE">Buñga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tokong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tokong</span>, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> and <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There were two (2) billiard tables and on them the following
persons were playing:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Domingo <span class="SpellE">Teraytay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> <span class="SpellE">Buñga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tokong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Sunico</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The billiard game was first interrupted when Domingo <span class="SpellE">Teraytay</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span> were
grappling for the knife which was protruding at the back pocket of the former,
the knife was ultimately taken with the assistance of <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sunico</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aureliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacanor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Manuel <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>, as owner of the billiard hall, confiscated the
knife in order to prevent any trouble therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>, sometimes called 'Rodolfo', clattered the billiard
balls which caused Alexander Mantilla to admonish him to stop his act as he was
not concerned with the game.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Without any word, accused Manuel <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>
who came from the back of Mantilla, held the hands of the latter while being
raised when all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of </span>a sudden, <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> appeared in the
scene, with unsheathed sharp pointed bolo (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A')
which was hidden inside the umbrella (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B')
thrust many times said bolo upon Mantilla.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mantilla was released only by <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>, after
the victim was staggering unconsciously <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">who
</span>later fell dead outside the billiard hall." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 29-31)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> and <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span> were then charged with murder with assault upon an
agent of person in authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both
pleaded not guilty to the charge and after trial, the trial court rendered the
judgment which appellants now seek to be reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, the prosecution established the guilt of
appellants through the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tokong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teraytay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Minglana</span>, among others, who were all present at the
billiard hall when the incident happened.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> testified that in the
billiard hall, he saw Manuel <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dominog</span> <span class="SpellE">Teraytay</span> grappling with
each other for possession of a knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The others present in the hall tried to pacify the two and the knife was
taken by <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Sunico</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also testified that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">he saw </span><span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> making trouble inside the billiard hall and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>advised by the deceased Alexander
Mantilla to stop as he had nothing to do with the game.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>
approached the deceased from behind and took hold of the latter's hands,
whereupon <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> run
towards them repeatedly thrusting a sharp pointed bolo at the victim (Alexander
Mantilla) who kicked his assailant in a futile attempt to defend himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim was hit below his left breast and
right breast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Weakened and already down,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>
again stabbed the helpless victim on the mouth after which appellants <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> and <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span> walked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">away </span>(TSN, March 8, 1979, pp. 3-11;
Original Records, pp. 172-180).</p>

<p class="BODY">The above testimony of <span class="SpellE">Crisologo</span> was
corroborated in all material points by the testimonies of (1) <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Tokong</span> who was inside the
billiard hall because of rain (TSN, April 25, 1979, pp. 3-12; Original Records,
pp. 218-227); (2) Domingo <span class="SpellE">Teraytay</span> who was also
playing billiards (TSN, June 28, 1979, pp. 3-16; Original Records, pp.
250-263); and (3) <span class="SpellE">Edisimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Minglana</span>
who was also in the hall watching the billiard game (TSN, November 13, 1979,
pp. 4-17; Original Records, pp. 232-245).</p>

<p class="BODY">All of the above witnesses gave exactly the same version of the
gruesome and merciless killing of Alexander Mantilla to the effect that the
deceased was only trying to stop <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> from making trouble when Manuel <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>
approached the deceased from behind, held both of the latter's hands, while the
accused <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>,
father of <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>, suddenly attacked Mantilla and
stabbed the latter several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
victim staggered towards the door, he fell flat on his face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied with the injuries already inflicted
by him, accused <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> held the head of the fallen
victim and stabbed the latter on the armpit, hacked him at the left arm biceps,
forearm and mouth.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellants raise the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>"1. THAT THE
LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT APPELLANT MANUEL LOROSO HELD ALEXANDER
MANTILLA FROM THE BACK WHILE THE LATTER WAS BEING STABBED SEVERAL TIMES BY
APPELLANT JOVEN BAUSING, THAT APPELLANT MANUEL LOROZO AND JOVEN BAUSING
CONSPIRED IN KILLING ALEXANDER MANTILLA AND THAT APPELLANT MANUEL LOROZO'S

<blockquote>"5. ASSUMING

ERRED IN CONVICTING HIM OF MURDER AND NOT ONLY OF HOMICIDE AND IN NOT
APPRECIATING THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCE OF VOLUNTARY SURRENDER IN HIS
FAVOR." (Appellant's Brief, pp. 1-2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
85 c-d)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' assignment of errors being interrelated, the same
shall be addressed jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>
admitted the killing of the deceased but invokes the justifying circumstance of
defense of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">r</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">elative in a bid to escape criminal
liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a careful examination
of the verdict rendered by the trial court, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">We </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">find no compelling
reason to reverse the judgment of conviction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In order that the justifying circumstance of defense of a
relative may be properly invoked, the following requisites must concur:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) in case the
provocation was given by the person attacked, that the one making the defense
had no part therein (Art. 11, par. 1 &amp; 2, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">The first requisite is indispensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There can be no self-defense unless it is
proven that there had been unlawful aggression on the part of the person
injured or killed by the assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
there is no unlawful aggression, there is nothing to prevent or repel (People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Malazzab</span>,
160 SCRA 123 [1988]; Ortega v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
[1990]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, for unlawful
aggression to be appreciated, there must be an actual, sudden, unexpected
attack or imminent danger thereof, and not merely a threatening or intimidating
attitude (People v. Pasco, Jr., <u>supra</u>; People v. <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>,
172 SCRA 149 [1989] and the accused must present proof of positively strong act
of real aggression (<span class="SpellE">Pacificar</span> v. Court of Appeals 125
SCRA 716 [1983]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Aquiatan</span>, 123 SCRA 501
[1983]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, 124 SCRA 835 [1983]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlawful aggression must be such as to put in
real peril the life or personal safety of the person defending himself or of a
relative sought to be defended and not an imagined threat.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, appellant <span class="SpellE">Bausing's</span>
claim of unlawful aggression committed by the deceased has not been
sufficiently established to warrant the appreciation of defense of a relative
as a justifying circumstance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All four
prosecution witnesses who were eyewitnesses to the killing of Mantilla
testified categorically that no unlawful aggression was committed by the
deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim merely admonished <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>, son of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Joven</span>, to stop meddling with the game going
on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's claim of defense of his
son cannot prevail over the positive testimonies of the eyewitnesses pointing
beyond reasonable doubt that he (appellant) was the aggressor who treacherously
assaulted the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, appellant <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>
already admitted the killing of Mantilla.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Having made the admission, it is thus incumbent upon the accused to
prove the justifying circumstance to the satisfaction of the court in order to
be relieved of any criminal liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In such instances, the accused must proffer strong, clear and convincing
evidence of self-defense and depend not on the infirmity of the prosecution,
for even if the latter was weak, the plea of self-defense cannot prosper
especially so where the accused himself has admitted the killing, as in the
case at bar (People v. <span class="SpellE">Bayocot</span>, 174 SCRA 285 [1989];
People v. <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>, 157 SCRA 320 [1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Abagon</span>, 161 SCRA 255 [1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Tesorero</span>,
71 SCRA 579 [1976]); People v. <span class="SpellE">Llamera</span>, 51 SCRA 48
[1973]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Bauden</span>, 77 Phil. 105 [1946]; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Ansoyon</span>, 75 Phil. 772 [1946]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span> next contends that the
trial court erred in holding that <span class="SpellE">Ederesa</span> <span class="SpellE">Tokong's</span> testimony has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">been </span><span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> and therefore fatal to
the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lorozo</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">argues </span>that he has in fact
testified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as a </span><span class="SpellE">sur</span>-rebuttal witness and rebutted the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Tokong</span> point by point.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is devoid of merit and need not be discussed at
length.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the trial court meant when
it said that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Tokong</span> was <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> is the fact that appellant <span class="SpellE">Lorozo</span>
failed to rebut the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Tokong</span> that after
the killing of Mantilla, said appellant slept in their (spouses <span class="SpellE">Tokong's</span>) house with bloodstains on his shirt and pair of
trousers and that the blanket and beddings used by him were also stained by
blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court's pronouncement
did not mean that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">no </span><span class="SpellE">sur</span>­-rebuttal witness was ever presented by the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nature, character, location and number of the wounds suffered
by the deceased belie any supposition that the deceased was the unlawful
aggressor (People v. <span class="SpellE">Marciales</span>, 166 SCRA 436
[1988]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As reflected in the autopsy
report and the testimony of Dr. Prospero <span class="SpellE">Tayco</span>, the
deceased suffered seventeen (17) incised wounds, including the "through
and through" incised wound of the heart, 21 inches <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">long </span>with entrance at the apex of the heart which is the primary
cause of death and massive blood l<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">oss </span>secondary
thereto, aside from the numerous abrasions and avulsions (Autopsy Report, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 15, Original Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In contrast, both <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> suffered no
injury.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The infliction the 17 wounds on
the deceased could only lead to the conclusion that Mantilla was the victim of
aggression and not the unlawful aggressor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>
faults the trial court for classifying his denial of participation in the
killing of the deceased as one of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant claims that he was busy pumping air into his <span class="SpellE">petromax</span> lamp lighting the billiard hall at the time the
incident occurred and ran away as soon as he saw blood after the second thrust
by appellant <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's defense would therefore appear as a simple denial of his
participation in the commission of the offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's unsubstantiated disclaimer of participation cannot be
given any credence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Self-serving as it
is, his denial of participation in the commission of the crime cannot prevail
over the forthright and positive testimonies by the prosecution witnesses as
they uniformly pointed to him as having held both hands of Mantilla from behind
and raised them upwards while <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> suddenly appeared on one side of Mantilla,
unsheathed the bolo inside the umbrella he (<span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>)
was carrying and stabbed the victim continuously.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Loroso</span> released his
hold of Mantilla only when the latter was already on the verge of death as a
result of the stab wounds inflicted by appellant <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The weak denials of appellant cannot prevail
over the clear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and positive testimonies
</span>of the eyewitnesses regarding his participation in the killing of the
deceased (People v. <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>, Sr., 188 SCRA 175
[1990]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Delavin</span>, 148 SCRA 25 [1987]; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Alcid</span>, 135 SCRA 280 [1985]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Tuscano</span>, 137 SCRA 203 [1985]) for it is a settled rule that
greater weight is given to the positive identification of the accused by the
prosecution witnesses than to the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> plain
denial of participation in the commission of the crime (People v. de Mesa, 188
SCRA 48 [1990]; citing People v. Canada,144 SCRA 121 [1986]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span>, Jr., 124 SCRA 906 [1983]).</p>

<p class="BODY">That the killing of Alexander Mantilla is murder qualified by
treachery is borne out by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The victim was not only unarmed but was also deprived of every means to
defend himself from the treacherous attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Loroso</span> held both hands of the deceased victim
while <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> suddenly
appeared and started stabbing the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In People v. <span class="SpellE">Mahusay</span> (138 SCRA 452 [1985]),
this Court ruled that there is treachery where the victim was held tightly by
one of the accused before his co-accused stabbed him, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants executed the crime in a manner
that tended directly and specially to ensure its execution without risk to
themselves arising from the defense which the deceased might have made (Art.
14, par. 16, Revised Penal Code; People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacabes</span>,
137 SCRA 158 [1985]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The presence of conspiracy was inferred from the concerted acts
of both the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They both
approached the victim almost simultaneously.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As one held the victim's hands tightly from behind and raised them
upward, the other delivered the fatal stabs which caused Mantilla's death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The manner by which <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span>
held the victim's hands from behind which clearly prevented the latter from
defending himself and without which act the crime would not have been
accomplished, makes appellant <span class="SpellE">Loroso</span> a conspirator
and a principal by indispensable cooperation (People v. Martinez, 127 SCRA 260
[1985]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the accused by their acts
aimed at the same object, one performing one part and another performing
another part so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>to complete
it, with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>view to the attainment
of the same object, and their acts were concerted and cooperative, indicating
closeness of personal association, concerted action and concurrence of
sentiments, the lower court was justified in concluding that the defendants
were engaged in conspiracy wherein the act of one is the act of all (People v. <span class="SpellE">Manlolo</span>, 169 SCRA 394 [1989]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy can be inferred from and proven by
the acts of the accused themselves when said acts point to a joint purpose and
design, concerted action, and community of interests (People v. <span class="SpellE">Monadi</span>, 97 Phil. 575 [1955]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender invoked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span><span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span> deserves scant consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While appellant <span class="SpellE">Bausing</span>
claims to have voluntarily surrendered to Pat. Arturo <span class="SpellE">Esparrago</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte Police Station on the night of
the incident, records of the case show that appellants were in fact arrested on
August 28, 1978 as per return made by Station Commander <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>
Plaza of General Luna, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Norter</span> Police Force (Original Records, p. 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mitigating circumstance of voluntary
surrender cannot be appreciated considering that the return of the warrant of
arrest showed that appellant was in fact arrested.</p>
