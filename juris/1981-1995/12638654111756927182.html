<p class="BODY">Based on the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> testimony,
private respondent contends that there is no sufficient basis for the charge
and this fact warrants the dismissal of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent also claims that the crime has prescribed
since more than ten (10) years had elapsed from the time the crime was
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the information charges
the complex crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of a
public document, then the penalty shall be that for the more serious crime
which shall be applied in its maximum period, as provided for by Article 48 of
the Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more serious crime
in the present case is the falsification of the public document which is
punishable with <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
in its medium and maximum period and a fine not exceeding P5,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> being a correctional penalty, the same
prescribes in ten (10) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was noted in said motion to dismiss that the information filed
in the case merely alleged the date of the commission of the crime which was
February 5, 1964 and the information was filed only on March 29, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, private respondent
claims that more than ten (10) years had passed from the commission of the
crime to the filing of the information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No other allegation having been made <span style="">as </span>to the discovery of the alleged
crime, private respondent claimed that the period of prescription commenced on
the day on which the crime was committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He asserts that, from the date appearing in the transfer certificate of
title covering the land mortgaged with the bank, the mortgage documents were
duly registered with the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
City on <st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1964</st1:date>,
hence the alleged crime became public knowledge on the same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To support his theory, private respondent
made the following citation:</p>

<blockquote>"The period of prescription commences to run from the date of
the commission of the crime if it is known at the time of its commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, if there is nothing that was concealed or needed to be
discovered, because the entire series of transactions was by public
instruments, duly recorded, the crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
committed in connection with said transaction was known to the offended party
when it was committed and the period of prescription commenced to run from the
date of its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People v. <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Dinsay</span></st1:city>, <st1:country-region>C.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution countered that the testimony of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Carrera</span> shows that what was intended was an authority to
mortgage only the one-half portion pertaining to his brother and he was only
quoting what his brother told him when he said that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> this is an authority to Federico de Guzman to get a

argued that the crime was actually discovered only in January, 1972 when Ramon

considered by the prosecution as a mere evidentiary matter which would not be

affirmative. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The falsification of a
public document may be a means of committing <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
because before the falsified document is actually </span>utilized <span style="">to defraud another, the crime of
falsification has already been consummated, damage or intent to cause damage
not being an element of the crime of falsification of public, official or
commercial documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The damage to
another is caused by the commission of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, not by
the falsification of the document, hence, the falsification of the public,

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the foregoing disquisition on the sufficiency of
the charge of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of a public
document, the resolution of the issue on prescription is, however, determinative
of the validity of the impugned orders of public respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the penalty
for a complex crime is that for the most serious component offense, the same to
be applied in its maximum period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
crime of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> thru falsification of a public
document, the more serious crime is the falsification which carries with it the
correctional penalty of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">prision</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> </span>in its medium and maximum
periods and <span style="">a </span>fine not<span style=""> more than P5,000.00 imposed by Article 172
of the Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crimes punishable by
correctional penalties prescribe in ten (10) years pursuant to Article 90 of
the Code, and Article 91 thereof states that the prescriptive period commences
to run "from the day on which the crime is discovered by the offended
party, the authorities, or their </span>agents x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The document which was
allegedly falsified was a </span>notarized special power of attorney registered
in the <span style="">Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="2"><span style="">February 13, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> authorizing private respondent to mortgage a
parcel of land covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 47682 in order to
secure a loan of P8,500.00 from the People's Bank and Trust Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>

January, 1972 by reason of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit against
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="">People <i>vs</i>.
Reyes</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> cites authorities on the well established

considerations, it holds that the prior ruling in <u>Cabral vs. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, etc., et al.</u>, </span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to the effect that in the crime of
falsification of a public document the prescriptive period commences from the
time the offended party had constructive notice of the alleged forgery after
the document was registered with the </span>Register of Deeds is not without
legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was also noted that in
<span class="SpellE"><u>Armentia</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Patriarca</span>,
et al.</u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in interpreting the phrase "from the
discovery" found in Article 1391 of the Civil Code which authorizes
annulment, in case of mistake or fraud, within four years from the time of the
discovery of </span>the same, <span style="">the Court
also held that the discovery must be reckoned to have taken place from the time
the document was registered in the Register of Deeds, for the familiar rule is
that registration is a notice to the whole world and this should apply to both
criminal and </span>civil cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are further in accord
with the conclusion in <u>Reyes</u> </span>that <span style="">the application of said rule on constructive notice in the
interpretation of Article 91 of the Revised Penal Code would most certainly be
favorable to private respondent herein, since the prescriptive period of the
crime shall have to be reckoned with earlier, that is, from the time the
questioned documents were recorded in the Registry of Deeds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
