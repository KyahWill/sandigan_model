This is an unusual case where Leon P. Gellada, as counsel, appealed for the <em>deceased plaintiff Silverio Lumawag</em>, who was succeeded by his wife, Gabina Casamayor, <em>also deceased.
</em>
<p>
In controversy is a parcel of land located at Barrio Tina, Dumarao, 
Capiz which Lumawag claimed as his own but which was allegedly forcibly 
entered upon by Solis.  The trial court rendered a judgment declaring 
Lumawag the owner of the land.  It ordered Solis to deliver to him 150 
cavans of palay and 30 cavans of corn beginning 1947 at the market value
 of eight pesos per cavan of palay and four pesos per cavan of corn.
</p><p>
<em>Pending appeal, or on February 10, 1958, the judgment was executed</em> upon Lumawag's filing of a bond of P3,000 with two bondsmen.  Solis had to deliver the land to Lumawag.
</p><p>
That judgment was <em>reversed</em> by the Court of Appeals on October 
17, 1963 in Lumawag vs. Solis, CA-G.R. No. 24014-R.  Lumawag's complaint
 against Solis was dismissed.
</p><p>
Upon motion of Solis, the trial court in an order dated February 17, 
1964 ordered the issuance of a writ of execution.  The sheriff on <em>March 17, 1964</em> restored Solis to the disputed land.  He reported that as of that date both <em>Lumawag and his wife, Gabina Casamayor, were dead </em>(pp. 21-22, Appellant's brief).
</p><p>
The <em>death of his client </em>did not deter Gellada from filing with 
this Court a petition for prohibition and certiorari, wherein he 
questioned the trial court's jurisdiction over Solis' claim for damages.
  The case was dismissed by this Court in a minute resolution dated 
November 16, 1964 (Lumawag vs. Solis, L-23665).
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the <em>death of Lumawag and his wife,</em> Judge Golez 
continued to hear Solisâ€™ claim for damages.  In an order dated April 5, 
1965, he turned the tables against the deceased Lumawag by ordering him 
to deliver to Solis 150 cavans of palay and 30 cavans of corn yearly for
 the period from February 20, 1958 to March 16, 1964 or pay its 
equivalent value of eight pesos and four pesos per cavan, respectively 
(p. 69, Record on Appeal).  Gellada appealed to this Court <em>although Lumawag was already dead</em>.
</p><p>
Gellada contended in his brief that Judge Golez had no jurisdiction to 
adjudicate damages, that his adjudication amounted to an amendment of 
the Appellate Court's decision and that damages could not be adjudged 
against the bondsmen after entry of final judgment.  (The order against 
Lumawag did not include his bondsmen.)
</p><p>
Gellada in the concluding part of his brief raised a point not raised in
 the trial court.  He noted that Solis' claim should be filed in the 
administration proceeding for the settlement of Lumawag's estate 
pursuant to section 5, Rule 87, now Rule 86, of the Rules of Court.  
Solis did not file any brief.
</p><p>
In the resolution of <em>May 16, 1984,</em> the Court required plaintiff's counsel to state the names of the persons succeeding Lumawag and his wife as plaintiffs.  <em>Plaintiff-appellant's counsel did not comply with that resolution.</em>
</p><p>
In view of that <em>non-compliance </em>and since it is <em>anomalous to decide a case where the deceased appellant has not been substituted by his heirs</em>
 and, moreover, as the claim of Solis is ultimately a money claim which 
should have been ventilated in the proceeding for the settlement of the 
debtor's estate, the Court resolved to dismiss this case.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p><em> Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, </em>and<em> Cuevas, JJ., </em>concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, J., (Chairman)</em>, on leave.
</p><p>
<em>Escolin, J.</em>, no part.
