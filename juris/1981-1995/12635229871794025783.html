Felix Mozar and Bartolome Mozar, together with Mallorico Mozar (who 
pleaded GUILTY upon being arraigned and was thereafter accordingly 
sentenced)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  were charged with and prosecuted for <em>MURDER</em>
 before the defunct Court of First Instance of Surigao del Norte under 
Criminal Case No. 4330, for allegedly having conspired, confederated and
 mutually helped one another in attacking and stabbing Rudy Salino 
thereby inflicting upon him physical injuries which caused the death of 
the latter.
<p>
Tried after pleading "NOT GUILTY" upon arraignment, they were convicted as charged and thereafter sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 with all the accessories prescribed by law; to indem­nify the heirs of 
the victim Rudy Salino, jointly and severally, in the sum of P8,000.00 
with no subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and to pay 
two-thirds (2/3) of the costs.
</p><p>
They now come before US, through the instant appeal, assailing the 
aforesaid judgment of conviction contending among others, that the trial
 court erred (1) in giving credence to the testimony of Alfredo Anuario,
 the prosecution witness; (2) in finding that conspiracy existed among 
the three accuseds; (3) in considering nighttime, abuse of superior 
strength and treachery to have attended the commission of the crime; and
 (4) in failing to consider the mitigating circums­tances of passion and
 obfuscation and voluntary surrender in favor of the appellants.
</p><p>
The prosecution's version of the stabbing incident as summarized by the Hon. Solicitor General in the appellee's brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  runs thus -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Early in the morning of October 25, 1969, the body of Rudy Salino
 was found slumped face down, on the floor of a boat locally known in 
Surigao del Norte as "baroto", somewhere at Lake Mainit.  The boat 
containing Salino's body was towed by Barrio Captain Jimmy Salino and 
Pat. Ernesto Salino from the lake to barrio Mansayao where Pat. 
Cresencio Belbar of the Mainit Police Department had stationed him­self 
and waited for the body for initial investigation (tsn, page 14, August 
20, 1970).  Belbar took note of the general appearance of the cadaver 
and drew a sketch (Exh. "C", folder of exhibits) thereby showing the 
location of the inflicted wound after which he had it brought to the 
house of Maximo Salino where a post­mortem examination was conducted by 
Dr. Felixberto Dumadag (tsn, pp. 14-15, <em>ibid</em>; pp. 68-70, August 21, 1970).
  </p>
  <p> Events that transpired earlier reveal that at about seven o'clock 
in the evening of October 24, 1969, Rudy Salino, accompanied by Alfredo 
Anuario, was riding on a "baroto" bound for the poblacion of Mainit from
 Mansayao to buy medicine for his ailing child (tsn, pp. 91-93, August 
21, 1970).  The two were paddling the boat with Anuario steering the 
same.  After negotiating some two hundred yards from Mansayao, the two 
met Felix Mozar, Bartolome Mozar (appellants herein) and Mallorico Mozar
 (convicted ahead) from the opposite direction.  Coming to a hailing 
distance with each other, Rudy Salino, the victim, greeted Felix Mozar 
and asked the latter where they were going.  Instead of giving an answer
 to Salino's greeting, the Mozars steered their own "baroto" nearer to 
that of Salino and Anuario.  At a standing position, Felix Mozar, now 
within reach of Salino, suddenly hurled a spear at the latter, hitting 
him in the abdomen.  At this juncture, and taking Felix Mozar's sudden 
attack as a cue, Bartolome Mozar and Mallorico Mozar jumped into and 
boarded Salino's boat and started hitting him with weapons in their 
hands, consisting of a paddle and a bolo, respectively.  Alfredo 
Anuario, gripped with fear and sensing something drastic might happen to
 him, jumped over­board and swam to the nearest shore which was some 
sixty meters away.  He then ran straight to his house which was about 
half a kilometer away.  After regaining his composure, he reported the 
matter to Maximo Salino, father of the victim (tsn, pp. 94-97, August 
21, 1970)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The defense, on the other hand, thru the combined testimonies of Felix 
Mozar, Bartolome Mozar and Conrado Palasan, sought to establish -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x that sometime past 5:00 p.m. of October 24, 1969, Felix 
Mozar accompanied by his sons Bartolome and Mallorico, went out in his 
boat to Lake Mainit at a spot called Haponan Sili, a fishing ground, to 
find out if his fishing net which he had previously laid out, had some 
catch.  Of the three, only Mallorico Mozar carried a bolo.  Mallorico 
Mozar was sitting at the front, Felix Mozar at the middle, while 
Bartolome Mozar was steering; that they reached Ha­ponan Sili at about 
6:30 p.m. but could not find the fishing net at the spot where it was 
laid.  After looking around for some time, Mallo­rico Mozar pointed to 
two persons who were also riding in a boat and coming towards their 
direction; that they steered their boat towards the other boat Mallorico
 Mozar saw, and at a distance of about 30 meters from each other, they 
recognized the occupants of the other boat to be Rudy Salino and Alfredo
 Anuario; that the other boat carrying Rudy Salino and Alfredo Anuario 
suddenly turned back, and it was at that time that they saw in the boat 
of Rudy Salino and Alfredo Anuario the fishing net of Felix Mozar, the 
ones marked as Exhibit "D" and "D-1"; that they gave chase to the boat 
of Rudy Salino and Alfredo Anuario; that they overtook the other boat, 
and one fathom before they actually overtook the other boat, Alfredo 
Anuario dived into the water and swam towards the nearest shore; that 
before Alfredo Anuario actually dived into the water, Felix Mozar called
 out at the two, Rudy Salino and Alfredo Anuario, but the latter did not
 answer; that instead, as the two boats edged near each other, Rudy 
Salino struck Felix Mozar with a paddle; that Felix Mozar was hit at the
 left wrist, which blow rendered him unconscious; that a medical 
cer­tificate (Exh. "3") was issued by Dr. Dumadag on account of this 
injury; and that at this instance, Mallorico Mozar began hitting Rudy 
Salino with his bolo and all that he, Felix Mozar, in his unconscious 
state, could hear was the sound of the blows hitting Rudy Salino."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The prosecution's case against the appellants gravitates principally 
upon Alfredo Anuario, an admitted companion of the victim on the fatal 
night of the incident in question, whose testimony have been heavily 
relied upon by the trial court.  This witness testified that at about 
7:00 o'clock in the evening of October 22, 1969, he was requested by the
 deceased Rudy Salino to go with him to the town of Mainit for the 
purpose of buying medicine for the latter's child who was then afflicted
 with fever.  He agreed and they used a boat locally known as "baroto", 
which the two of them paddled in proceeding to their destination.  On 
their way and after having travelled about 200 meters, they met another 
"baroto".  On board this "baroto" were accused Felix Mozar and his two 
sons, Mallorico and Bartolome.  After the two "barotos" came nearer to 
each other and at a point where they were merely about two fathoms from 
each other, Rudy Salino asked Felix Mozar where he was going.  Felix 
Mozar did not answer.  Instead, he immediately stood up, grabbed 
something "as small as a thumb but about one fathom long", and thrust it
 against Rudy Salino who was then sitting at the time, and almost 
simultaneously shouted, "son of a bitch".  Rudy Salino was hit at the 
stomach.  It was at that moment when Mallorico Mozar and Bartolome Mozar
 boarded Salino's "baroto" and started <em>hacking </em>Rudy Salino, but
 could not tell what instruments were used by them.  Because he was 
afraid that he may be involved, he immediately dived into the water and 
swam ashore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
The pertinent portion of his testimony particularly inculpatory against Mallorico and Bartolome Mozar, runs thus -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q:  After Rudy Salino was hit by the thrust of Felix Mozar, what happened if there was any? </p>
  <p>
    A:   Mallorico Mozar and Bartolome Mozar immediately went to our boat and started <em>hacking</em> the victim Rudy Salino.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q:  <em>What instrument was used by Mallorico Mozar if you still remember?
    </em> </p>
  <p>
    A:   <em>What I know is that they were hacking Rudy Salino.
    </em> </p>
  <p>
    Q:  What else happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A:   Because I was afraid that they will include me, I immediately dive into the water.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q:  After you dive into the water, what did you do?
  </p>
  <p> A:   I went or I swam to the shore."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>

  <p>
    A:   <em>Mallorico Mozar was bringing a bolo while Bartolome Mozar was bringing a paddle.
    </em></p>
  <p>
    Q:  Did you see what Bartolome Mozar do with the paddle?
  </p>
  <p> A:   (Witness demonstrated as if he was holding with his right hand the paddle and immediately rode to their boat’ ".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Considering the hazy and vague narration that characterized Anuario's 
declaration - particularly with respect to the manner of attack and 
instruments used - the issue that presents itself for a preemptive 
resolution is this - Where was Anuario at the time the victim was 
allegedly assaulted by the appellants?
</p><p>
From his direct testimony, he would like us to believe that he was 
beside the victim inside the latter's "baroto" when the appellants 
ganged up and assaulted the victim.  Cross examined however on this same
 point, his admission reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q:  You said you dived into the water and swam to the shore, was 
in this occasion that Felix Mozar uttered those words in an angry 
manner? </p>
  <p>
    A:   Not yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q:  Did you not dive from the boat immediately when Felix Mozar was already in your boat?
  </p>
  <p>
    A:   That was at a time when Felix Mozar stood up when they were 
already near and said, 'son of a bitch' and then thrust the instrument 
to the body of Rudy Salino.
  </p>
  <p> Q:  So you were already at the lake when you heard those words uttered by Felix Mozar, ‘You are a son of a bitch’. </p>
  <p>
    Fiscal Mantilla:
  </p>
  <p>
    Misleading, Your Honor, We object.
  </p>
  <p>
    Court:
  </p>
  <p>
    Objection sustained.
  </p>
  <p>
    Atty. Egay:
  </p>
  <p>
    Q:   Now, you said that after diving from the boat, you swam to the shore?
  </p>
  <p>
    A:    <em>When Rudy Salino was hit in the abdomen, I immediately jumped to the water.</em> </p>
  <p>
    Q:   And when you jumped into the water, you swam back to barrio Mansayao, is that correct?
  </p>
  <p> A:    I swam towards the barrio with a distance of 40 meters from the barrio Mansayao."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Redirect examination of this witness was undertaken by the prosecution. 
 But his aforesaid damaging admission to the effect that "When Rudy 
Salino was hit in the abdomen, I immediately jumped to the water" which 
contradicts his previous statement on direct examination on the same 
point, was never amplified much less explained.  In fact, there was not 
even a mere attempt, to show why and how he was still able to see and 
witness the hacking (not stabbing) of the victim by appellant Bartolome 
and Mallorico Mozar when, as admitted by him, right after the victim 
Salino was hit in the abdomen, he (Anuario) immediately jumped to the 
water.
</p><p>
Against that backdrop, we are far from convinced that Anuario actually saw what he narrated before the trial court - the <em>hacking </em>of the victim by Mallorico to which appellant Bartolome was allegedly a participant.
</p><p>
But what appears to have totally demolished Anuario's credibility on 
this specific point - hacking by Bartolome and Mallorico of the victim -
 is the nature of the injuries sustained by the victim.  Post-mortem 
examination conducted upon the cadaver of the victim by Dr. Dumadag, Jr.
 failed to reveal any wound produced by hacking.  On the contrary, what 
this medico-legal witness found were one (1) punctured wound, twelve 
(12) stab wounds, and abrasions.  Certainly, if the victim was 
continuously hacked by appellants Bar­tolome and Mallorico as claimed by
 Anuario, it is inconceivable as to why no hack wounds have been 
sustained by the victim.  For to hack is to cut with repeated or regular
 blows; to severe with repeated blows or to cut with blows.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  The character of said injuries together with the afore-described 
circumstances unerringly point to the inevitable conclusion - that 
Anuario was no longer at the scene of the incident when the victim was 
allegedly attacked by Mallorico and appellant Bartolome.
</p><p>
Another factor which adds credence to this view is the fact that Anuario
 suffered no injury whatsoever. . . . .  Not even a scratch or minor 
bruises.  If he was still beside the victim inside the latter's 'baroto'
 when the victim was attacked, we see no reason as to how he could 
miraculously escaped injury when he too could be a suspect in the taking
 of Felix Mozar's fishing net.
</p><p>
Aside from this Alfredo Anuario, no other eye witness appeared to have 
been presented by the prosecution.  The only inculpatory evidence then 
left against appellant Bartolome Mozar is that coming from Dr. 
Felixberto Dumadag, Jr., the Municipal Health Officer of Numancia, 
Surigao del Norte, who conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of the 
victim.  After dwelling at length on the various injuries found by him 
in the course of his autopsy examination, this witness concluded that 
from the nature of the injuries sustained by the victim, more or less, 
three (3) kinds of instruments may have been used by the victim's 
attackers, namely:  (1) a blunt instrument causing abrasions in the 
xyphoid process of the sternum; (2) a sharp pointed instrument that 
caused the punctured wound; and (3) a sharp bladed instrument which 
caused the multiple stab wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  On his conclusion, there can be no quarrel with this medical examiner 
since his aforesaid conclusion appeared to be supported by the very 
nature of the injuries sustained by the victim.  For instance, the 
punctured wound on the right part of the chest just below the nipple 
which is two inches therefrom,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  could have been caused by sharp instrument; the rest of the other 
injuries under Item Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15, by a 
sharp bladed instrument; and those appearing under Item Nos. 9 and 13 
which are abrasions on the thorax, by a blunt instrument.  That three 
kinds of instruments may have been used by the victim's attackers, do 
not however conclusively establish the number of participants 
responsible for inflicting the injuries found upon the body of the 
victim.  At most, it could merely serve as a basis for concluding, but 
not conclusive, that more than one person may have inflicted the said 
injuries.  But since Mallorico Mozar had already pleaded guilty thereby 
owning sole responsibility for the killing of the victim, then who 
between Felix and Bartolome must or could be made additionally liable 
for the victim's death?  While the finger of suspicion points to both or
 either one of them, suspicion alone however strong could not amount to 
proof beyond reasonable doubt sufficient enough to serve as a basis for 
conviction.  The presumption of innocence in favor of the appellant 
Bartolome Mozar cannot be said to have been overwhelmed by the necessary
 quantum of evidence prescribed by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</p><p>
But may not appellant Bartolome be held criminally liable because of the
 charge of conspiracy?  Our answer is in the negative.  Settled is the 
rule that proof of previous agreement to commit the crime is not 
necessary for conspiracy may be deduced from the facts and circumstances
 surrounding the commission of the offense.  Concert of action at the 
moment of consummating the crime and the form and manner in which 
assistance is rendered to the person inflicting the fatal wound may 
determine complicity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  And where conspiracy is duly established, the role played by each conspirator is of no moment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  Conspiracy, however, must be established by positive evidence and 
conviction pursuant thereto must be founded on facts, not on mere 
inferences and presumption.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
  In the case at bar, other than conjectures and assumptions, no 
satisfactory and convincing evidence exists as to what appellant 
Bartolome Mozar had done that will warrant a con­clusion of his being in
 conspiracy with appellant Felix Mozar.  There being no conspiracy, 
criminal liability of the appellants must be individual and separate.
</p><p>
Having disposed of the imputation against appellant Bartolome Mozar, we 
now come to the case of Felix Mozar.  Similar to that of Bartolome, the 
People's case against Felix Mozar centers also on the testimony of 
Alfredo Anuario.  But whereas we could not swallow 'hook, line and 
sinker' Anuario's version with respect to the participation of appellant
 Bartolome, we find his narration with respect to Felix credible enough.
  Reliance on the portion of his testimony with respect to Felix Mozar's
 role in the killing of the victim, does not violate any rule of 
evidence whatsoever.  For the fact that a witness may have lied at one 
instance on certain point does not make his entire testimony totally 
incredible and therefore inadmissible.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is perfectly reasonable to believe the testimony of a witness 
with respect to some facts and disbelieve it with respect to other 
facts.  And it has been aptly said that even when witnesses are found to
 have deliberately falsified in some material particulars, it is not 
required that the whole of their uncorroborated testimony be rejected, 
but such portions thereof deemed worthy of belief may be credited."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Anuario's testimony that upon Felix Mozar's 'baroto' approaching that of
 the victim's, Felix stood up, grabbed something, and then immediately 
thrust it against Rudy Salino<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
  appeared undiscredited despite extensive and piercing 
cross-examination.  Anuario at that time was still with the victim 
inside the latter's 'baroto'.  Anuario's story with respect to Felix's 
role finds ample and vivid corroboration in injuries marked as Item No. 2
 appearing in Exhibit "A"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> 
 which is a punc­tured wound "at the right side of the stomach towards 
the right part of the chest just below the nipple about 2 inches 
therefrom".  As testified to by Dr. Dumadag, Jr. this wound is fatal 
considering its depth and location and the vital organs in that region. 
 It is enough to produce death.  It is a punctured wound caused by a 
sharp pointed instrument inflicted by one who must have stationed 
himself in front of the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>  This is the injury produced by the sharp pointed instrument hurled by appellant Felix at the victim.
</p><p>
Aside from being positively identified, enough motivation exists on the 
part of appellant Felix Mozar to "deliver the works" on the victim in an
 attempt to get even with the latter.  The loss of his fishing net on 
that fatal night in question is not merely an isolated one.  He was the 
victim of previous losses before and believing that the deceased was 
likewise the perpetrator of and/or has something to do with his present 
and earlier losses, and feeling aggrieved by the affront against his 
property right, he has chosen to take the law unto his hands thereby 
penalizing the victim without recourse to legal and judicial processes. 
 It is but fitting and proper therefore that he should suffer the 
consequences of such transgressions to impart upon him that ours is a 
society of laws and not of men.
</p><p>
In his attempt to exculpate himself from criminal liability, Felix Mozar
 claimed that he was not able to inflict any wound upon the victim 
because when they overtook him, the latter immediately struck him 
thereby hitting him at his left wrist thus rendering him unconscious.  
In support of his assertion Felix Mozar submitted a medical certificate 
(Exh. "C") issued by Dr. Felixberto Dumadag, the same physician who 
conducted the autopsy of the victim, which states that a certain Felix 
Mozar
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "was inflicted with CONTUSION AND SWELLING at the left wrist region; and that </p>
  <p align="center">
    x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</p>
  <p align="center">
    x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</p>
  <p> said physical injury will require medical attendance for less than one (1) week."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellant Felix Mozar's aforesaid entreaty failed to persuade us.  On 
the contrary, the injury described in the aforesaid medical certificate 
hardly supports his story that the blow delivered against him knocked 
him down to unconsciousness.  We therefore find his excuse too lame a 
pretense as to warrant belief in it.
</p><p>
The charge against the appellants is that of <em>MURDER</em>, the attack
 or the assault being allegedly attended by treachery and evident 
premeditation.  We agree with the trial court that treachery was present
 despite the attack being frontal and/or face to face since it was so 
sudden and unexpected and without the victim being afforded the 
opportunity to defend himself against said attack.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>
  As regards evident premeditation, the evidence on hand failed to show 
elements thereof having atten­ded the commission of the offense in the 
case at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>  The 
encounter between the victim and his assailants was merely accidental.  
It occurred while the latter was merely searching for the missing fish 
net.  Similarly, nighttime not having been intentionally sought for in 
order to better accomplish their criminal design,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  may not be considered to have aggravated the criminal liability of the offenders.
</p><p>
Anent appellant's fourth assignment of error, the lower court committed 
no error in discarding voluntary surrender.  For while it is true that 
after the commission of the offense, appellant Felix Mozar went to the 
Municipal Building of Mainit yet he did so for purposes of surrendering 
his son, Mallorico, and not to submit himself to the authorities (in 
connection with the killing of the victim) which is one of the essential
 requisites of voluntary surrender.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> 
</p><p>
With respect to passion and obfuscation, it must be brought by causes 
naturally producing in a person powerful excitement such that he loses 
his reason and self-control thereby diminishing the exercise of his will
 power.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  The act producing
 the obfuscation must not be far removed from the commission of the 
crime by a considerable length of time, as in the instant case, during 
which the accused might have recovered his normal equananimity and to 
preclude a realization of the wrongfulness of the act taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
  As correctly pointed out by the prosecution, appellant's loss of his 
fishing net and paraphernalia occurred long before the killing of the 
victim.  The trial court therefore correctly disregarded said mitigating
 circumstances in favor of the appellant.
</p><p>
In its judgment of conviction, the court a quo ordered an 
indemnification of P8,000.00.  That should now be increased to 
P30,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> 
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, and except as thus modified, the judgment appealed from is
