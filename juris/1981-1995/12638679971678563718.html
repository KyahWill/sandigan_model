the Head of the CPLA Moro Company and the CPLA.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>their petition
dated November 17, 1987, petitioners alleged, among others, that Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an is the Chairman of the Cordillera <span class="SpellE">Bodong</span> Association; that sometime on October 5, 1987, at a
checkpoint manned by elements of the CPLA situated at <span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span>

Daniel has been detained and deprived of his liberty by respondents; that
respondents have no legal basis nor authority to detain him; that Daniel has
not committed a crime nor charged with an offense for which he can be legally
detained; that petitioners together <span style="">with
</span>their relatives and friends went several times to the CPLA detachment at
<span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span> but respondents refused to release Daniel
and reveal the place where he is detained; that respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>
in a radio interview admitted that the CPLA is responsible for the
disappearance of Daniel and even hinted that he will be or had been killed by
the CPLA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As relief petitioners prayed
that a writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> <span class="GramE">be</span> issued
directing respondents to produce the body of Daniel and show cause for his detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also prayed that after hearing Daniel be
restored of his liberty and discharged from confinement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1987</st1:date>,

the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the respondents
were required to respect Daniel's constitutional rights, (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

 23, 1987</st1:date> resolution of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They also prayed that the RUC <span class="SpellE">Comander</span> of

<p class="BODY">In this Court's resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1988</st1:date> the respondents were required to comment

resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of the resolution was again sent by

Col. <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Capulong</span> of

that the Office of <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>
at the Presidential Mansion House Complex refused to receive the resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1988</st1:date> alleging that said refusal
is in compliance with the CBA-CPLA Collective Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1988</st1:date>,
the Second Division referred the case to the Court En Banc <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">consulta</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
its resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1988</st1:date>,
the Court En Banc accepted the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On petitioners' motion, the Court En Banc issued a resolution
directing the Northern Luzon Command to submit a report on whether <span style="">the resolution </span>of <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1988</st1:date> was served on respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copy of said resolution for <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> and the CPLA was
received by <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> Martinez on <st1:date year="1988" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1989</st1:date>,

incarcerate him until he complies with the aforementioned resolution of this
Court (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 152-154).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1989</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>, thru his counsel Atty. Romeo <span class="SpellE">Bringas</span>, filed an urgent motion to lift the order of arrest
alleging among others that he has not defied any lawful order of this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pointed out that he is <span class="GramE">not residing nor</span> holding office at the Cordillera
House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also denied having authorized <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> Martinez or anybody to receive any mail matter or
resolution in his behalf at the Cordillera House or elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his motion he also requested a period of
thirty (30) days to file his comment on the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their comment and opposition to the urgent motion filed on
September 15, 1989, petitioners argued that the urgent motion dated September
6, 1989 is a mere scrap of paper as it was not verified by respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> but by a certain <span class="SpellE">Ama</span>
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Agosto</span> who claims to be the Deputy Chief
Executive of the Cordillera <span class="SpellE">Bodong</span> Administration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1989</st1:date>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>, thru his counsel, filed a reply to petitioners'
comment and opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reply was
verified by respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> and subscribed before
the Assistant Clerk of Court <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On even date respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> also filed his

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court En Banc resolved to lift, effective immediately, the order of arrest
it had issued on <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also exonerated respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> from the charge of contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court noted that respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> has not defied the order of this Court as he never
resided at the place where said order was served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>
was required to appear before Executive Judge Stella <span class="SpellE">Dadivas-Farrales</span>
and make a return of the writ of <u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u> </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 190-191).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his return of the writ of habeas corpus dated November 3,
1989, respondent <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Balweg</span></span><span style=""> </span>alleged <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">alia</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>that Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an
is not in his custody; that he has not ordered the apprehension of Daniel; that
he has nothing to do with the disappearance of Daniel; that he learned of
Daniel's disappearance in the radio and newspaper reports; that the petition
does not specifically state his participation in the disappearance of Daniel so
that the petition states no cause of action against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite notice served on <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="12">December
 26, 1989</st1:date>, petitioners failed to produce their witnesses in the
hearing scheduled on <st1:date year="1990" day="5" month="2">February <span style="">5, </span>1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid <span style="">delay, </span>Executive Judge Stella <span class="SpellE">Dadivas-Farrales</span>
allowed respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> to present his
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his testimony respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> confirmed the statements contained in his return of
the writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> dated <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1989</st1:date> which was marked as Exhibit
"1".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His compliance/comment
filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1989</st1:date>
before this Court, marked as Exhibit "2" was also offered together
with Exhibit "1" as part of the testimony of respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Noe</span> Villanueva, who
appeared as counsel for petitioners, cross-examined respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 30, 1990, pursuant to the resolution of the <span style="">Court </span>En Banc dated March 1, 1990,
allowing Atty. <span class="SpellE">Noe</span> Villanueva to present evidence for
the petitioner, Judge Stella <span class="SpellE">Dadivas-Farrales</span> heard
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Carmencita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an
the wife of Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her testimony she declared that her
husband left <span class="SpellE">Kalinga-Apayao</span> to attend a<span style=""> </span>seminar of the Cordillera People's
Alliance on September 7, 1987; that on October 5, 1987 on his way home her
husband was abducted; that on October 6, 1987 she was informed by her uncle <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> Lao-en that her husband was captured by <span style="">the </span>CPLA at <span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span>
Gate; that together with her brothers, sisters, and relatives numbering about
50, on the same day, they proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span>
Gate to talk with the CPLA; that at the <span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span> Gate
she talked with <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span>
alias "Ka <span class="SpellE">Sulong</span>", the Commander of the
CPLA; that <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span>
informed her that they talked to her husband but "they let him leave"
and "sent him away"; that she retorted that if it is true that her
husband left them he should be in their home; that they left the barracks and
searched the surroundings at the <span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span> Gate and in
the river; that the search lasted for 10 days but they were not able to find
Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an; that she knows <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> alias "Ka Ambo", because she saw him
before; that "Ka Ambo" wrote a letter dated October 20, 1987 to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Balway</span>
requesting for a conference; that they did not go to Captain <span class="SpellE">Balway</span> for a conference because they were afraid that if
they do not consent to the wishes of "Ka Ambo" they <span style="">will </span>be imprisoned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ramon <span class="SpellE">Edduba</span>, another witness for the
petitioners, testified that on October 5, 1987, at around 1:30 o’clock in the <span style="">afternoon, </span>while he was standing in
front of the restaurant at the <span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span> Gate, a jeep
arrived with Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an as one of the passengers
seating in the front portion of the jeep; that as Daniel was about to step down
from the jeep, <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span>
together with four (4) other men carrying long firearms, one of whom he
identified was "Ka Ambo", the "Assistant" of <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span>, approached the
former and got some papers from him; that after Daniel refused to drink liquor
"Ka <span class="SpellE">Sulong</span>" and his men tied his hand and
feet with a rope; that Daniel shouted for help when he was carried to the
detachment but nobody helped him; that after that he boarded a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and left the place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On direct examination he identified the affidavit he executed on
November 19, 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When cross-examined
he admitted to Atty. Romeo <span class="SpellE">Bringas</span>, the counsel for
respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> that he did not know the full <span style="">name </span>of "Ka Ambo" and the
other companions of <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners formally offered Exhibit "A", the letter
dated October 20, 1987 of "Ka Ambo" in the <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span>
dialect with a translation in the English Language by Court Interpreter <span class="SpellE">Teodora</span> <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> and Exhibit
"B", the affidavit dated November 17, 1987 of witness Ramon <span class="SpellE">Edduba</span>, after which they rested their case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The primary issue to <span style="">be </span>resolved
is whether or not Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-<span class="GramE">an
is</span> unlawfully detained or restrained of his liberty by respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> and the CPLA.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> generally applies to "all cases
of illegal confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his
liberty or by which the rightful custody of any person is withheld from the
person entitled thereto." (Section 1, Rule 102, Revised Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">The ultimate purpose of the writ of <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
is to relieve a person from unlawful restraint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Castriciones</span> v. Chief of Staff Armed Forces
of the Philippines, G.R. No. 65731, September 28, 1989, En Banc, Minute
Resolution; <span class="SpellE">Mizuaki</span> <span class="SpellE">Takenouchi</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Cristi</span> et al., G.R. 82232, July 25, 1988, Third
Division, Minute Resolution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
devised as a speedy relief from unlawful restraint (<span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Lukban</span>, 39 PHIL. 778).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a remedy intended to determine whether
the person under detention <span style="">is </span>held
under lawful authority (<span class="SpellE">Quintos</span> v. Director of
Prisons, 55 Phil. 304).</p>

<p class="BODY">In passing upon a petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>, the
Court must determine whether:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
person in whose behalf the application is made is imprisoned or restrained of his
liberty; (2) the name of the person detaining another; (3) the place where he
is imprisoned or restrained of his liberty; (4) the cause of his detention
(Section 3, Rule 102, Revised Rules of Court).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Only if the Court is satisfied that a person is unlawfully restrained of
his liberty that the petition for <u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u> </span>will be granted and the
person detained will be released from confinement (Gonzales v. Viola, 61 Phil.
824).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the respondents are not detaining
nor restraining the applicants or the person in whose behalf the petition for <u><span style="">habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>corpus</u> </span>is filed the petition should be dismissed (In the
matter of the Petition for <u><span style="">Habeas</span></u><span style=""> <u>Corpus</u> </span>of Ferdinand E. Marcos
etc. v. Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>, May 18, 1989, G.R. No. 88079, En Banc, Minute
Resolution).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioners miserably failed to substantiate
by clear and convincing evidence that Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an
in whose behalf the petition has been filed is under the custody or is unlawfully
detained and restrained of his liberty by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence linking respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> to the disappearance of Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an
is the declaration of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Edduba</span>, the lone
eyewitness for the petitioners that on October 5, 1987, at about 1:30 o'clock
in the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span>
together with "Ka Ambo" and three other men carrying long firearms
accosted Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an at the <span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span>
Gate and thereafter with a rope tied on Daniel's hands and feet he was carried
to the detachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witness <span class="SpellE">Edduba</span> apparently committed an error in naming "Ka
Ambo" as one of the companions of <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span> as he declared that "Ka Ambo" is the
assistant of <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span>
(TSN, June 19, 1990, p. 6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 231).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination he even admitted that he
does not know the full name of "Ka Ambo".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the affidavit he executed on November 19,
1987, which petitioners offered as Exhibit "B", Ramon <span class="SpellE">Edduba</span> declared that before Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an
could step down from the jeep he was approached by <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Appag</span> accompanied by men armed with long firearms one
of whom he identified as "Ka Elias".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He has not declared nor even insinuated that respondent <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span> popularly known as
"Ka Ambo" the Head of the CPLA was with the group of <span class="SpellE">Sagmayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Appag</span> when <span style="">Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an </span>was
accosted at the <span class="SpellE">Cagaluan</span> Gate on October 5, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ostensibly, the disappearance of Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> was established by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Edduba's</span>
testimony corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Carmencita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an the wife of Daniel <span class="SpellE">Ngaya</span>-an.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the granting of the relief is not
predicated on the disappearance of a person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners must establish by competent and convincing evidence that
the missing person in whose behalf the petition is filed is under the custody
of the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here there is no evidence that respondent <span class="SpellE">Balweg</span>
the Head of the <span class="GramE">CPLA,</span> is responsible for the
