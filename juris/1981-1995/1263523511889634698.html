Petition for review of the Decision of the then Court of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  in CA-G.R. No. 52783-R, entitled "Horacio Yaptinchay <em>vs.</em>
 Luis Tan, et al.", which modified the judgment of the former Court of 
First Instance of Rizal in Pasig, Branch XXV, in a damage suit for 
malicious prosecution by reducing the award of moral damages from 
P100,000.00 to P20,000.00, but affirming the appealed judgment in all 
other respects.
<p>
Sometime between 8 and 10 December 1969, petitioner Luis TAN, the 
General Manager of the United Bazaar, a business enterprise in Baguio 
City, owned by and under the sole proprietorship of his co-petitioner, 
Esperanza ANG, purchased goods in Manila worth P2,712.00.  The 
merchandise was delivered to Highway Express, Inc., a common carrier, 
for transport to Baguio City.  The President of Highway Express is 
private respondent Horacio YAPTINCHAY.
</p><p>
On 12 December 1969, the expected date of arrival of the goods, TAN 
inquired from the Highway Express Branch Office in Baguio City about the
 goods, but he was informed that the truck loading the merchandise had 
not yet arrived.  The following day, TAN left for Manila and inquired 
from the traders from whom he bought the goods whether they had made 
shipment.  The reply was in the affirmative, as shown by bills of lading
 (Exhibits "5", "6", "7" &amp; "8").  Upon further inquiry from Highway 
Express, a receiving clerk told him that the goods had already been 
shipped to Baguio City.  Verification in Baguio City, however, revealed 
that the goods had not arrived.  After shuttling back and forth between 
Baguio and Manila, and failing to see respondent YAPTINCHAY and to 
obtain definite information regarding the fate of the merchandise, TAN 
sought the assistance of the Filipino-Chinese Chamber of Commerce in 
Baguio City, which addressed a letter, dated 21 December 1969, to the 
Highway Express Manager (Exhibit "A") demanding the recovery or refund 
of the cost of the undelivered cargo or their substitution with the same
 or identical articles.  No reply having been received, petitioners 
wrote a demand letter dated 5 January 1970 (Exhibit "B").  On 14 January
 1970, Highway Express replied asking for sufficient time to investigate
 the cause of the alleged loss of the goods (Exhibit "10").
</p><p>
On 26 February 1970, TAN filed a criminal complaint for Estafa before 
the City Fiscal's Office in Baguio City (I.S. No. 9711) against 
YAPTINCHAY.  After preliminary investigation, the complaint was amended 
to include Juan Estacio (Assistant Manager), Primo Visperas (Dispatcher)
 and Manuel Labayne (Receiving Clerk) all of Highway Express.
</p><p>
On 16 November 1970, the criminal accusation was dismissed as against 
YAPTINCHAY and Juan Estacio for lack of probable cause, but an 
Information for Estafa was filed against the dispatcher, Visperas, and 
the receiving clerk, Labayne.  They were eventually acquitted by the 
City Court of Baguio, which found the element of misappropriation or 
conversion wanting, it appearing that the goods were robbed or hijacked 
while in transit.
</p><p>
About a year after the dismissal of the criminal case, or on 20 February
 1971, YAPTINCHAY commenced a damage suit (Civil Case No. 14430) in the 
then Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch VIII (later transferred to
 Branch XXV) against petitioners, Luis TAN and Esperanza ANG, for having
 lodged an allegedly malicious criminal charge.
</p><p>
Petitioners, as defendants below, traversed the Com­plaint alleging, in 
essence, that YAPTINCHAY's imputation of malicious prosecution was 
without basis considering that petitioners had no personal knowledge of 
the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss of the goods while in 
transit prior to the filing of their complaint for estafa because 
neither YAPTINCHAY nor his representative bothered to apprise them of 
the true cause of the loss of the goods while in transit.  They then 
counterclaimed for actual, moral, and exemplary damages, as well as 
attorney's fees and costs of litigation.
</p><p>
In a Decision rendered on 5 July 1972, the Trial Court awarded damages to YAPTINCHAY, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering defendants to pay plaintiff the sum of: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> “1.  P100,000.00 as and by way of moral damages; </p>
    <p> “2.  P10,000.00 as and by way of attorney's fees; and </p>
    <p> “3.  Costs of suit. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> SO ORDERED"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On appeal, respondent Appellate Court, in a Decision promulgated on 11 
August 1982, modified the appealed judgment by reducing the award of 
moral damages to P20,000.00 but affirmed it in all other respects.  
Reconsideration of the judgment sought by petitioners was denied by that
 Court.
</p><p>
Hence, petitioners' availment of this Petition to which we gave due course.
</p><p>
The issues raised by the petitioners may be compressed into the primary 
question of whether or not petitioners had imputed the estafa against 
YAPTINCHAY before the prosecuting officer maliciously, and without 
probable cause, thereby rendering them liable for damages.
</p><p>
We find in the negative.
</p><p>
In a damage suit based on malicious prosecution, there are essential elements that must be proven:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "To support an action for malicious prosecution under American law
 the plaintiff must prove, in the first place, the fact of the 
prosecution and the fact that the defendant was himself the prosecutor, 
or that he instigated its commencement, and that it finally terminated 
in his acquittal; that, in bringing it, the prosecutor had acted without
 probable cause, and that he was actuated by legal malice, i.e., by 
improper or sinister motives.  These three elements must concur; and 
there is no distinction between actions for criminal prosecution and 
civil suits.  Both classes require substantially the sane essentials.  
Malice is essential to the maintenance of an action for malicious 
prosecution and not merely to the recovery of exemplary damages.  But 
malice alone does not make one liable for malicious prosecution, where 
probable cause is shown, even where it appears that the suit was brought
 for the mere purpose of vexing, harassing and injuring his adversary.  
In other words, malice and want of probable cause must both exist in 
order to justify the action."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In pronouncing the petitioners liable for damages, respondent Appellate 
Court sustained the lower Court's finding that petitioner-defendant TAN 
had instituted the estafa charge against YAPTINCHAY without probable 
cause as evidenced by its dismissal by the Fiscal, and with malice, as 
TAN had prior knowledge of the loss of his goods while in transit by 
robbery-hijacking before he filed the estafa charge.
</p><p>
The existence of malice is negated by the facts.  Clear and preponderant
 evidence is wanting to prove that petitioners had knowledge that the 
criminal charge was false, that they had acted in bad faith<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> , and that they were actuated by improper and sinister motives.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  The evidence discloses, contrary to the Trial Court's deductions, that
 TAN had not been informed of the cause of the loss of his merchandise 
while he was making repeated inquiries regarding the same.  In its reply
 letter to petitioners' demand to make good the loss, Highway Express 
merely asked for time to investigate without advancing any cause for the
 disappearance of the goods.  TAN learned for the first time about the 
robbery-hijacking at the preliminary investigation of the complaint for 
estafa at the Fiscal's Office when the police report on the 
robbery-hijacking was presented by the accused.  The inclusion of 
YAPTINCHAY in the criminal complaint must have been prompted by TAN's 
reasonable belief that, as President of the company in whose custody the
 goods were lost, he was responsible for such loss.  Moreover, the 
evidence shows that TAN had, in fact, sought the advice of his friend 
Fiscal Salvador Valdes, Jr., after narrating to the latter the facts and
 circumstances surrounding the loss of his goods.  Relying upon said 
advice TAN signed the Affidavit prepared by the said prosecuting 
officer.  Such advice of counsel negates malice and is a complete 
defense to an action for malicious prosecution.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is the general rule, in the absence of any statutory provision
 to the contrary, that advice of counsel is a complete defense to an 
action for malicious prosecution where it appears that the prosecution 
was instituted in reliance in good faith on such advice, given after a 
full and fair statement of all the facts to the attorney.  This is true 
whether the advice was sought in respect of a civil action or a criminal
 prosecution.  Moreover, it is immaterial that the attorney's advice was
 unsound or erroneous; if the defense is worth anything to a party it 
must be available when through error of law, as well as of fact, his 
action has failed; the lawyer's error will not deprive his client of the
 defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The dismissal by the Fiscal of the complaint for estafa as against 
YAPTINCHAY neither rules out probable cause in so far as TAN was 
concerned.  The circumstances surrounding the loss of the merchandise, 
as they appeared to TAN, were such as to excite reasonable belief in his
 mind that YAPTINCHAY was guilty of the crime for which he (TAN) had 
charged him (YAPTINCHAY).  This is the essence of probable cause which 
further eliminates herein the element of malice essential in making out a
 case of malicious prosecution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  Moreover, the action of the Fiscal in filing the Information for 
estafa against the other employees of Highway Express shows that he 
believed in the existence of probable cause for TAN's charge 
notwithstanding the defense of robbery-hijacking.
</p><p>
Overall, paramount is the consideration that free resort to Courts for 
redress of wrongs is a matter of public policy.  The law recognizes the 
right of everyone to sue for that which he honestly believes to be his 
right without fear of standing trial for damages.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "While Courts must look upon the plight of hapless victims of 
unfounded and malicious prosecution with tolerance and sympathy, sound 
principles of justice and public policy dictate that persons shall have 
free resort to the courts for redress of wrongs and vindication of their
 rights without fear of later on standing trial for damages where by 
lack of sufficient evidence, legal technicalities or a different 
interpretation of the laws on the matter, the case would lose ground and
 therein defendants are acquitted.  Proof and motive that the 
prosecution or institution of the action was prompted by a sinister 
design to vex and humiliate a person and to cast dishonor and disgrace 
must be clearly and preponderantly established to entitle the victims to
 damages and other rights granted by law; otherwise, there would always 
be a civil action for damages after every prosecution's failure to prove
 its cause resulting in the consequent acquittal of the accused 
therein."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, respondent Appellate Court's judgment is hereby REVERSED and 
SET ASIDE, and the suit for damages (Civil Case No. 14430) is hereby 
ordered DISMISSED.  Petitioners' counterclaims are likewise DISMISSED 
for insuffi­ciency of evidence.  No costs.
