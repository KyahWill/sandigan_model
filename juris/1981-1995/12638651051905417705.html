				<H3>CONGRESSMAN ENRIQUE T. GARCIA, SECOND DISTRICT OF BATAAN, PETITIONER, VS. THE BOARD OF
INVESTMENTS, THE DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY, BATAAN PETROCHEMICAL
CORPORATION AND PILIPINAS SHELL CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>GRIÑO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with a
prayer for preliminary injunction, the petitioner, as congressman for the
second district of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, assails the approval by
the Board of Investments (BOI) and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
of the amended application for registration of the <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
Petrochemical Corporation, which seeks to transfer the site of its
petrochemical complex from <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, the original <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of choice, to the province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the case presents purely legal issues, and the subject of
the controversy vitally affects the economic interests of the country which
should not <span class="SpellE">pend</span> for too long, the Court, after
hearing the parties’ extensive oral and written arguments on the petitioner's
application for preliminary injunction, believes that it may now decide the
merits of the petition as well.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proclamation No. 361 dated March 6, 1968, as amended by
Proclamation No. 630 dated November 29, 1969, reserved a 388-hectare parcel of
land of the public domain located at <span class="SpellE">Lamao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Limay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> for
"industrial estate purposes," in line with the State policy of
promoting and rationalizing the industrialization of the Philippines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>P.D. No. 1803, dated January 16, 1981,
enlarged the area by 188 hectares, making it a total of 576 hectares, reserved
for the Petrochemical Industrial Zone under the administration, management and
ownership of the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC).</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Refining Corporation (BRC
for short) is a wholly government-owned corporation, located in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It produces 60% of the national output of naphtha.</p>

<p class="BODY">Taiwanese investors in a petrochemical project formed the <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Petrochemical Corporation (BPC) and applied with BOI
for registration as a new domestic producer of petrochemicals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its application specified <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place> as the plant site.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the terms and conditions for the
registration of the project was the use of "naphtha cracker" and
"naphtha" as feedstock or fuel for its petrochemical plant. The petrochemical
project was<b> </b>to be a joint venture with PNOC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>BPC was issued a Certificate of Registration
on <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1988</st1:date> by
BOI.</p>

<p class="BODY">BPC was accorded pioneer status and was given fiscal and other
incentives by BOI, like, (1) exemptions from tax on raw materials, (2)
repatriation of the entire proceeds of liquidation of investments in currency
originally made and at the exchange rate obtaining at the time of repatriation;
and (3) remittance of earnings on investments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As additional incentive, the House of Representatives approved a bill,
introduced by the petitioner, Congressman Garcia, eliminating the 48% <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> tax on naphtha if and when it would be
used as raw material in the petrochemical plant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The chairman of BPC, Tomas T. N. <span class="SpellE">Hsi</span>, profusely welcomed the bill, stating:</p>

<blockquote><i>"This project is aiming at a boon
not only to the </i><st1:place><st1:placetype><i>province</i></st1:placetype><i>
 of </i><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><i>Bataan</i></span></st1:placename></st1:place><i>,
but to the country of the </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i>Philippines</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i>
in general.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will support the
development of the Philippine petrochemical industry by providing an ability to
compete in the world market for manufactured petrochemical derivatives such as
polyethylene and polypropylene products . . .” (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, in February 1989, A. T. <span class="SpellE">Chong</span>,
chairman of USI Far East Corporation, the major investor in BPC, personally
delivered to Trade Secretary Jose <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> a letter
dated <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1989</st1:date>,
advising him of <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> desire to amend the original
registration certificate of its project by changing the job site from <span class="SpellE">Limay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>,
to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> (Annex F, p. 51, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>News of the shift was published by one of the
major Philippine dailies which disclosed that the cause of the relocation of
the project is the insurgency and unstable labor situation in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The presence in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> of a huge liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) depot owned by the <span class="SpellE">Pilipinas</span><b> </b>Shell
Corporation was another consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The congressmen of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
vigorously opposed the transfer of the proposed petrochemical plant to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At a
conference of the Taiwanese investors with President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
and her Secretary of Defense and Chief of Staff of the Army, the President
expressed her preference that the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
petrochemical plant be established in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, despite speeches in the Senate and in the House opposing
the transfer of the project to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, BPC filed in
the BOI on April 11, 1989 a request for "approval of an amendment of its
investment application x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
for establishing a petrochemical complex in the Philippines." <span class="GramE">(Annex F, p. 51, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span> The
amendments consisted of:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) increasing
the investment amount from US$220 million to US$320; (2) increasing the
production capacity of its naphtha cracker, polyethylene plant and
polypropylene plant; (3) changing the feedstock from naphtha only to
"naphtha and/or liquefied petroleum gas;" (4) transferring the job
site from <span class="SpellE">Limay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> (Annex F, p. 51, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Senator Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span>, Antonio
Francisco, vice-president and general manager of the <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
Refining Corporation, Congressman <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Payumo</span> of the 1st District of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>,
herein petitioner Congressman Enrique Garcia of the Second District, the
provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, the League of Mayors
and various civic and professional organizations all opposed the transfer of
the project to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> (pp. 10, 11, 12, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>; Annex Q, p. 81, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 4, 1989, petitioner addressed a letter to Secretary <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI),
through BOI vice-chairman and manager Tomas <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>,
requesting for "a copy of the amendment reportedly submitted by Taiwanese
investors, to their original application for the installation of the <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Petrochemical Plant, as well as the original
application itself together with any and all attachments to said original
application and the amendment thereto." <span class="GramE">(Annex K, p. 70,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1989</st1:date>,
BOI vice-chairman <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> informed petitioner that
the Taiwanese investors declined to give their consent to the release of the
documents requested (Annex O).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1989</st1:date>,
the BOI approved the revision of the registration of <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span>
petrochemical project (Annex S, p. 84, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1989</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition in this
Court, with a prayer for preliminary injunction, alleging that the BOI and DTI
gravely abused their discretion:</p>

<p class="BODY">(a) <span class="GramE">in</span> not observing due process in
approving without a hearing, the revisions in the registration of the <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> petrochemical project;</p>

<p class="BODY">(b) <span class="GramE">in</span> refusing to furnish the
petitioner with copies of <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> application for
registration and its supporting papers in violation of the Government's policy
of transparency;</p>

<p class="BODY">(c) <span class="GramE">in</span> approving the change in the site
of <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> petrochemical plant from <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place> to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
in violation of PD Nos. 949 and 1803 which establishes <span class="SpellE">Lamao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Limay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
as the "petrochemical industrial zone;"</p>

<p class="BODY">(d) <span class="GramE">in</span> approving the change in feedstock
from <u>naphtha</u> only, to <u>naphtha and/or <span class="SpellE">lpg</span></u>;
and</p>

<p class="BODY">(e) <span class="GramE">in</span> showing gross partiality for BPC.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is not concerned with the economic, social, and
political aspects of this <span class="GramE">case</span> for it does not possess
the necessary technology and scientific expertise to determine whether the
transfer of the proposed BPC petrochemical complex from <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place> to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
and the change of fuel from naphtha only to “naphtha and/or LPG” will be best
for the project and for our country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court is not about to delve into the economics and politics of this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is concerned simply with the
alleged violation of due process and the alleged extra limitation of power and
discretion on the part of the public respondents in approving the transfer of
the project to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> without giving due notice and
an opportunity to be heard to the vocal opponents of that move.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Omnibus Investments Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 226) of
July 16, 1987 expressly declares it to be the policy of the State "to
accelerate the sound development of the national economy x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> by encouraging private Filipino and foreign
investments in industry, agriculture, forestry, mining, tourism and other
sectors of the economy." For this purpose, the Code mandates the holding
of "consultations with affected communities whenever necessary" (Art.
2, <span class="SpellE">subpar</span>. 2 of the Omnibus Investments Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Correspondingly, Art.</span>
33 <span class="GramE">provides</span> that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Whenever necessary, the Board, through the People's Economic
Councils, shall consult the communities affected on the acceptability of
locating the registered enterprise within their community."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Code also requires the "<u>publication</u> of
applications for registration," hence, the payment of publication and other
necessary fees x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> prior
to the processing and approval of such applications" (Art. 7, <span class="SpellE">subpar</span>. 3, Omnibus Investments Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">As provided by the law, the <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span>
application for registration as a "new export producer of ethylene,
polyethylene and polypropylene" was published in the "Philippines
Daily Inquirer" issue of <st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="12">December
 21, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The notice invited
"any person with valid objections to or pertinent comments on the
above-mentioned application x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
(to file) his/her comments/objections in writing with the BOI within one (1)
week from the date of this publication" (Annex 1, public respondent's
Comment).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> amended application
(particularly the change of location from <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>) was in effect a new application, it
should have been published so that whoever may have any objection to the
transfer may be heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">BOI's</span> failure to publish such notice and to hold a hearing
on the amended application deprived the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>,
like the petitioner, of due process and amounted to a grave abuse of discretion
on the part of the BOI.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the public respondents' contention that the
petitioner has "no legal interest" in the matter of the transfer of
the BPC petrochemical plant from the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
to the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provision in the Investments Code
requiring publication of the investor's application for registration in the BOI
is implicit recognition that the proposed investment or new industry is a
matter of public concern on which the public has a right to be heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, when the BOI approved <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> application to establish its petrochemical plant in <span class="SpellE">Limay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>,
the inhabitants of that province, particularly the affected community in <span class="SpellE">Limay</span>, and the petitioner herein as the duly elected
representative of the Second District of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
acquired an interest in the project which they have a right to protect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their interest in the establishment of the
petrochemical plant in their midst is actual, real, and vital because it will
affect not only their economic life but even the air they will breathe.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, they have a right to be heard or "be consulted"
on the proposal to transfer it to another site for the Investments Code does
require that the "affected communities" should be consulted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While this Court may not require BOI to
decide that controversy in a particular way, we may require the Board to comply
with the law and its own rules and regulations prescribing such notice and
hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span>, 136 SCRA 27 and <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
vs. Civil Service Commission, 150 SCRA 530, has recognized a citizen's interest
and personality to procure the enforcement of a public duty and to bring an
action to compel the performance of that duty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, what the petitioner seeks is for the Board of Investments
to hold a hearing where he may present evidence in support of his opposition to
the <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> amended application for registration (which
amounts to a new application) since one of the effects of the amendment is to
change the site of its petrochemical plant from <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's request for <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copies of certain documents filed by BPC together with its original
application, and its amended application for registration with BOI, may not be
denied, as it is the constitutional right of a citizen to have access to
information on matters of public concern under Article III, Section 7 of the
1987 Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The confidentiality
of the records on <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> applications is not absolute
for Article 81 of the Omnibus Investments Code provides that they may be
disclosed “upon the consent of the applicant, or on orders of a court of
competent jurisdiction.” As a matter of fact, a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copy of <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> position paper dated <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1989</st1:date>, in support of its
request for the transfer of its petrochemical plant to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
has been submitted to this Court as Annex A of its memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, just as the confidentiality of an applicant's records in
the BOI is not absolute, neither is the petitioner's right of access to them
unlimited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution does not
open every door to any and all information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Under the Constitution, access to official records, papers, etc.
is subject to limitations as may be provided by law (Art. <span class="GramE">III,
Sec. 7, second sentence).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law
may exempt certain types of information from public scrutiny" (<span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> vs. Civil Service Commission, 150 SCRA 530).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trade secrets and confidential,
commercial and financial information of the applicant BPC, and matters
affecting national security are excluded from the privilege.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the oral argument on the petitioner's application for a
preliminary injunction on <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court was informed that if the BOI will hold a hearing on the <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> amended application, the petitioner will be able to
present his evidence in opposition to the transfer of the project to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> within a period of one week.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After such hearing, the BOI shall render its
decision which the petitioner may appeal to the President as provided in
Article 36 of the Investments Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
decision will be final and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Investments is
ordered:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) to publish the amended
application for registration of the <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
Petrochemical Corporation, (2) to allow the petitioner to have access to its
records on the original and amended applications for registration, as a
petrochemical manufacturer, of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
Petrochemical Corporation, excluding, however, privileged papers containing its
trade secrets and other business and financial information, and (3) to set for
hearing the petitioner's opposition to the amended application in order that he
may present at such hearing all the evidence in his possession in support of
his opposition to the transfer of the site of the BPC petrochemical plant to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> province.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The hearing shall not exceed a period of ten (10) days from the date
fixed by the <span class="SpellE">BOl</span>, notice of which should be served by
personal service to the petitioner through counsel, at least three (3) days in
advance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hearings may be held from
day to day for a period of ten (10) days without postponements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition for a writ of prohibition or
preliminary injunction is denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="12">17 December 1987</st1:date>,
a group of Taiwanese investors, doing business under the name of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Petrochemical Corporation (BPC), filed with the
Board of Investments (BOI) an application <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for
</span>registration as a new export producer of petrochemicals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The notice of application was duly published
in the Philippine Daily Inquirer on <st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="12">21
 December 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
application, as submitted, specified that the amount of the investment for the
establishment of a petrochemical complex in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was $220 million and that the plant was to be located in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place> using "<span class="SpellE">naphta</span>"
as feedstock.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="1">14 January 1988</st1:date>,
after compliance with other legal requirements, the BOI approved the
application, and issued the corresponding Certificate of Registration on <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="2">24 February 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>BPC was accorded pioneer status and became
entitled to the incentives provided for in the Omnibus Investments Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In February 1989, BPC sought to amend its application by
proposing the change of plant site from <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> and the feedstock from "<span class="SpellE">naphta</span> only" to "<span class="SpellE">naphta</span>
and/or LPG," and increasing its investment to $320 million, making the
project the single biggest foreign investment in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to date.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="4">11 April 1989</st1:date>,
BPC formally asked the BOI for approval of the proposed amendments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, the legislative representative of
the Second District of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, opposed the change of
the plant site in a privilege speech before Congress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also sent letters to the BOI and the
Department of Trade and Industry setting forth his objections to the
transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a hearing conducted by the
Senate Committee on Ways and Means, petitioner appeared and expounded on his
position.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="5">25 May 1989</st1:date>,
the BOI approved the revisions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>the
registered petrochemical project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Earlier, or on <st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="5">21 May 1989</st1:date>,
citing Article 81 of the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987, the BOI denied
petitioner's request for a copy of the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>revisions
submitted by the investors because the latter had declined to give their consent
to the disclosure.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="5">27 May 1989</st1:date>,
a meeting was called by President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> in <span class="SpellE">Malacanang</span> to discuss the transfer of the project
site.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Present at the meeting were BOI
officials, the petitioner and the other Congressman from <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner requested the President to reconsider the BOI decision
approving the transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="6">24 June 1989</st1:date>, the President again
called a meeting with the <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Congressmen, the
Governor, and the Mayors of the province.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She asked the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
officials to withdraw their objections <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
the transfer of the plant site to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, lest the
investors </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pack </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">up and <span class="GramE">leave</span> for,

<p class="BODY">In his Petition, petitioner alleges that the BOI committed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">grave </span>abuse of discretion and denied
him due process when it approved, without <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">hearing, </span>the amendments
to the registration of the BPC petrochemical project; when <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it denied petitioner's request for a copy of
the amendments; and when it approved the change of the plant site and feedstock
of the plant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the majority opinion, the Court is not concerned
with the economic, social and political aspects of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In ruling in favor of petitioner, the majority faults the BOI
with grave abuse of discretion and has ordered it (1) to publish the amended
application for registration; (2) to allow petitioner to have access to its
records on the original and amended applications for registration, excluding
trade secrets; and (3) to set for hearing petitioner's opposition to the
amended application.</p>

<p class="BODY">With all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">due </span>respect,
I find no grave abuse of discretion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>the
part of <span class="GramE">BOI, nor</span> denial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">by </span>it to petitioner of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards publication, Article 54 of the Omnibus Investments
Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 54.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Publication

<p class="BODY">Clearly, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>not
the application itself that is required to be published but notice of the
action of the Board <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">plus </span>the
specified data.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Notice

<p class="BODY">Absent the requirement of publication of the application itself,
there should be no need either to publish the amendments to the
application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statement in the
majority opinion that the amended application is considered a new application
does not find support in the Omnibus Investments Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, the amendment did not change the
essence or nature of the petrochemical project but only the site and the
feedstock.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Specially</span> significant, too, is the fact
that the confidentiality of applications is specifically provided <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for in the Omnibus Investments </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bold">competent jurisdiction.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering that all applications and their supporting documents
are confidential and are not to be disclosed to any person, it follows that
amendments thereto should also be considered confidential and need no
publication.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Which brings us to the second part of the
majority disposition requiring BOI to allow petitioner to have access to its
records.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">If BOI did not furnish petitioner with copy of the original
application and amendments thereto, it was because it had received a reply from
the project proponents “advising us not to release the subject documents in
view <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the sensitive information
contained therein which includes the accumulation of the proponents' business
experience and know-how” (Annex "O," Petition).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No grave </span>abuse of discretion can be
attributed to the BOI, therefore, for not acceding to petitioner's request that
he be furnished with copies of the original application with its amendments and
attachments (Annex "K," Petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, pursuant to Article 81 of the Omnibus Investments
Code, the Court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>it does not now, can order the BOI to allow petitioner to
have access to its records on the original and amended applications for
registration.</p>

<p class="BODY">There seems to be no longer any necessity <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
however.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attached to public respondent's
Opposition is <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> Position Paper, dated <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="4">10 April 1989</st1:date>, wherein BPC discoursed
on the significant benefits to be achieved by the transfer and why "using
LPG as alternative feedstock will be very advantageous to the project (Annex
"2," Opposition).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition,
petitioner already has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>his
possession:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the approval by the BOI
of the BPC application for registration, which includes the pre–registration
and registration conditions (Annex "A," Petition); (b) the
post–registration specific terms and conditions, which the BOI imposed for the
project (Annex "B," ibid.); (c) the BPC letter to the BOI requesting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">approval of the amendment of its investment
application for registration for the establishment of a petrochemical complex
in the Philippines (Annex "F," ibid.); and (d) the approval </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the BOI on 25 May 1989 of the revisions
to the project, subject to additional conditions (Annex "S,"
ibid.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in the Supplemental
Opposition filed by BPC it has attached a summary of the considerations that
guided it in proposing the amendments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Virtually all the data petitioner needs, therefore, are now of record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority ruling also requires the BOI to set for hearing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">petitioner's </span>opposition to the amended
application so that he may present at such hearing all the evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">in </span>his possession in support of his
opposition to the transfer of the site of the project to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Omnibus Investments Code, however, does not require the BOI
to hold hearings before approving applications for registration or amendments
thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, hearings would
contravene <span class="SpellE">Codal</span> provisions on confidentiality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 7, paragraph 4, cited <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the majority opinion neither
supports the necessity of hearings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 7.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Powers and
Duties of the Board. </blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">x <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span></span> <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, due hearing is required only in connection with
controversies between registered enterprises or investors therein and government
agencies concerning the implementation of the Omnibus Investments Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not speak at all of a hearing on
applications for registration or amendments thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, Article 34 of the Omnibus Investments Code, in
providing that applications not acted upon by the Board within twenty (20) days
from official acceptance thereof shall be considered automatically approved
implies that a hearing is not at all indispensable in the matter of
registration of enterprises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
intention of the law to make BOI proceedings non-adversarial and as expeditious
as possible consistent with the <span class="SpellE">Codal</span> policy to
encourage <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">investments,</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> is clearly discernible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>a hearing, as
ordained, will serve no practical purpose for petitioner has already fully
presented his case, the BOI has given it due consideration and has acted
accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is concretely shown by
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">following exchange of
communications:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(1) In his letter to the Secretary of Trade and Industry, who is
concurrently Chairman of the Board of Investments, petitioner "<span class="GramE">reiterate(</span>d)" his "most vehement protest against
the maneuver to transfer the <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Petrochemical
project from <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
which, if <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">successful, would greatly
prejudice not only the people of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, but more
importantly, our country and government" (Annex “E,” Petition);<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(2) Petitioner's letter, dated 2 May 1989, to the Secretary of
Trade and Industry protested the latter's "official position that ‘<span class="GramE">The</span> final choice (of site) is still with the proponent (the
Taiwanese), who would, in the final analysis, provide the funding or risk
capital for the project'" (Annex "J," ibid.);<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(3) Attached to said communication was petitioner's letter, dated
24 April 1989, addressed to the Senate Committee on Ways and Means giving
fourteen (14) reasons why the project should not be transferred to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> (Annex "I," ibid.);</p>

<p class="BODY">(4) The reply-letter of the BOI to petitioner, dated 11 May 1989,
took exception to petitioner's claim that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
</span>BOI and the DTI, by not vigorously opposing the transfer, had violated
the Constitution, the Omnibus Investments Code and P.D. 949 as amended by PD
1803, and urged petitioner not to proceed with his planned court action as it
would only serve to "discourage foreign investors and derail efforts at
economic recovery" (Annex "M," ibid.);</p>

<p class="BODY">(5) Petitioner's letter to the BOI of 16 May 1989 rebutted point
by point the arguments in the BOI letter of 11 May 1989 and argued that
"PD No. 949, as amended by P.D. No. 1803, as well as related issuances,
have chosen <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> as the site of the petrochemical
project" (Annex "N," ibid.);</p>

<p class="BODY">(6) Petitioner's letter to the BOI of 29 May 1989 formalized his
"motion for reconsideration of the BOI "decision" approving the
transfer of the project from <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, and contended that President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
had set it aside (Annex "P," ibid.);<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(7) Petitioner's
follow-up letter to the BOI, dated 19 June 1989, claimed that the BOI decision
to approve the transfer of the project had, in effect, been reversed by the
President herself and that the BOI should "refrain from taking any step to
execute said defunct decision" (Annex "Q," ibid.);</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(8) In the BOI letter of 21 June 1989 to petitioner, the former
denied that there had been a reversal by the President of the BOI decision; and
that, as far as petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the BOI decision is
concerned, “since you are not submitting any new cause of action for BOI to
reconsider its decision, we believe that we have sufficiently answered the
questions you have raised in your letter dated 2 May 1989, which has been
replied to by the Managing Head of the BOI on 11 May 1989" (Annex
"R," ibid.).</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, there can be no question that petitioner has been fully
heard on his original petition to the BOI to disapprove the transfer of the project
site and on his motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No further purpose will be served by setting petitioner's opposition for
hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do I think that “affected communities” have a right to be
consulted, as opined by the majority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The provision pertinent thereto reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 33.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Application.
- Applications shall be filed with the Board, recorded in a registration book
and the date appearing therein and stamped on the application shall be
considered the date of official acceptance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Whenever necessary, the Board, through the People's Economic
Councils, shall consult the communities affected on the acceptability of
locating the registered enterprise within their community."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the requirement on consultation is qualified by
the phrase “whenever necessary.” The clear implication is that the BOI may
dispense with such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">consultations if it
believes that it can decide applications for registration by itself without
consultation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, it is my view that the B<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">OI </span>did not commit any grave abuse of discretion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>approving the amendments to <span class="SpellE">BPC's</span> application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Nor had it failed to observe due process in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">approving </span>the same without a formal hearing, petitioner having,
in fact, been fully heard.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
matter of determining whether the transfer of the plant site and change of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">feedstock will be best </span>for the project
and the country <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lies </span>with the
BOI as the administrative body specifically tasked with such matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that absent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>clear, manifest and grave abuse of
discretion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">amounting to want of
jurisdiction, the decision and findings of an administrative agency on matters
falling within its competence will not be disturbed by the Courts</span> (<span class="SpellE">Sagun</span> vs. People's <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span> and
Housing Corp. G.R. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">No. </span>44738,
June 22, 1988, 162 SCRA 411) as the same falls within that agency's special
knowledge and expertise gained by it from handling the specific matters falling
under its jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Mapa</span> vs. Arroyo et al., G.R.
No. 78565, July 5, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">I vote, </span>therefore,
for the dismissal of the petition for lack of merit, which dismissal should be
immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The holding of hearings will serve no purpose
other than unnecessarily delay the implementation of the Philippines’ biggest
foreign project, representing a major step towards industrialization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further delay can only produce a chilling
effect on foreign investments in the country.</p>
