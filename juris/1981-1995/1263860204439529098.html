<p class="BODY">The prefatory facts follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1941, the late Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>,
as a settler of the National Land Settlement Administration (NLSA), was
assigned <span class="SpellE">Farmlot</span> No. 1279 (later re-numbered as Lot

situated in <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
with an area of 11.8822 hectares (the Disputed Property, for easy
reference).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1949" day="24" month="12">24 December 1949</st1:date>, a Certificate of Permanent

by the Farm Administrator of <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> Settlement
District (Exhibits "1", "1-A" to "1-D").</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 March 1954, Senior Inspector <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abrea</span> of the Land Settlement and Development
Corporation, <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span> Settlement District, rendered
a Status Report attesting to <span class="SpellE">Felisilda's</span> actual
possession and occupancy (Exhibits "2", "2-A" to

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1960" day="11" month="10">11 October 1960</st1:date>,
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> filed Free Patent Application No.
37-175 for the Disputed Property with the Bureau of Lands, through Lands

Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> died (Exhibit "H").</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Free Patent Application No. 37-175 remained <span class="SpellE">unacted</span> upon and unprocessed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

sought his help in expediting action on her husband's application.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it was only on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="10">11
 October 1963</st1:date> that the Application for Free Patent signed by Nicolas
<span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> was formally presented, subscribed and
sworn to before Lands Inspector <span class="SpellE">Cejas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same document, two (2) witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Salada</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paterna</span> Cortes, subscribed and swore to a Joint Affidavit
in support of the Free Patent Application (Exhibits "G",

Patent, with a certification of posting by Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>,
subscribed and sworn to before Lands Inspector <span class="SpellE">Cejas</span>,

affiant was stated to have exhibited his Residence Certificate No. A-4968202
issued at <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, <st1:place>South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="2">18 February 1963</st1:date> (Exhibits "J", "J-1,
"J-2").</p>

<p class="BODY">On 31 October 1963, Inspector <span class="SpellE">Cejas</span>
submitted a Certification to the Director of Lands that upon ocular inspection
of the land covered by Free Patent Application No. 37-175, he found that the
applicant had been in continuous occupation and cultivation thereof since 1941;
that the applicant "is still living" (Exhibit "I-2"); that
it was free from claims and conflicts at the time of inspection; and
recommending that patent be issued to the applicant (Exhibit "I").</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="3">20 March 1967</st1:date>
the Bureau of Lands approved the Application and ordered the issuance of Patent
(Exhibit “L”).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="4">14 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">April </span>1967</st1:date> Free Patent No.
326416 was issued to Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>, for Lot No.
2198, P1s-209-D-11 followed by the issuance of the corresponding Original
Certificate of Title No. (P-29004) P-11128 on <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="5">9 May 1967</st1:date> (Exhibit "M").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was subsequently cancelled and Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-10450 was issued in the name of the Heirs of Nicolas
<span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> after an extrajudicial settlement had been
executed by them (Exhibit "1-A").</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 June 1972, for and in consideration of the sum of
P120,000.00 the Heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> sold
9.8822 hectares to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span>, and 2 hectares
to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Laiz</span> for P60,000.00 (Exhibit
"4"), or the totality of the area covered by the Free Patent.
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-12335 and T-12416 were issued to <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Laiz</span>, on <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="8">11 August 1972</st1:date> (Exhibit
"O") and <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="8">15 August 1972</st1:date>
(Exhibit "N"), respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It appears that thereafter <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span>
subdivided the area sold to him and was issued 307 Transfer Certificates of
Title, all on <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="4">20 April 1979</st1:date>
(Exhibits "P", "P-1" to "P-307").</p>

<p class="BODY">If the Deeds of Sale of <st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="6">14
 June 1972</st1:date> to <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Laiz</span> are to be taken at their face value, the Disputed
Property was sold beyond the prohibitory period of five (5) years from the
issuance of the Free Patent on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="4">14
 April 1967</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Republic
stresses, however, that as early as 1970, or within the proscribed period for
transfer of land covered by a Free Patent, the Heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> had already alienated portions of the land to <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Laiz</span> except that
the formal contracts were not executed until 1972.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof of the matter was that even on 29
September 1970 and 22 April 1971 <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span> had
executed acts of ownership by entering into notarized contracts to sell portions
of the Disputed Property with <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Jamila</span> and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Poliquit</span>,
respectively (Exhibits "K", "K-1" to
"K-12").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said contracts
carried the letterhead "<span class="SpellE">Matutum</span> Heights <span class="SpellE">Subd</span>., Manuel <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span>, Owner;
Tomas D. <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>, Manager."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="17" month="11">17 November 1972</st1:date>,
a Protest entitled "Sta. Cruz Homeowners Association Inc.,
Occupant-Claimant-Protestant, vs. Heirs of the late Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>
represented by Catalina <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>,
et al., Applicant-Respondent," was filed with the Bureau of Lands (Exhibit
"8").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The grounds relied upon
were that the protestants were the actual occupants of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
land; that the Free Patent Application filed on 11 October 1963 had been
falsified, the patentee having died in 1962; and that the land in question had
been sold to other parties before the expiration of five (5) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneously, the Association also filed a
Sales Application over the same property on the same date.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a 2nd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1973" day="11" month="7">11 July 1973</st1:date> the District Land
Officer Buenaventura M. Gonzales recommended "that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">case </span>be considered closed and dropped
from the records" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">since </span>the
subject land was already titled property (Exhibits "3", "3-A,
"3-B", <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding, in a 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
of <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="8">15 August 1974</st1:date>, the
Director of Lands ordered the investigation of the Protest (Exhibit
"A").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Land Inspector Francisco
del Rosario was assigned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>Investigator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After hearings conducted by him, he
recommended the annulment of the Patent on the principal grounds that neither
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> nor his heirs had continuously
occupied or cultivated the land; that the application filed by them appears to
have been falsified; and that Section 118 of the Public Land Law, had been
violated (Exhibit "F").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Adopting that
recommendation, on 18 June 1976, the Director of Lands rendered a Decision
declaring that Free Patent No. 326416 granted to Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>
was null and void as it had been fraudulently issued, and recommending the
judicial cancellation of said patent and title pursuant to Section 91 of the
Public Land Law (C.A. No. 141).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Ministry of Natural Resources dismissed the appeal to it on <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="6">24 June 1980</st1:date> and denied a Motion for
Reconsideration on <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="3">30 March 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime also, the widow, Catalina <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>,
and Land Inspector Vicente Gal <span class="SpellE">Cejas</span> were jointly
indicted for Falsification of Public Document in Criminal Case No. 732 before
the Court of First Instance of General Santos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="7">8 July 1976</st1:date>, said
Court found the totality of the evidence wanting on the charge of falsification
and absolved both accused from any criminal liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">It likewise appears that even as early as 23 March 1972, the
Provincial Fiscal of General Santos City, in a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>Joint Resolution, had dismissed I.S. Case No. 155 filed by one <span class="SpellE">Melquiades</span> <span class="SpellE">Hilaga</span> against the
Heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> for Falsification of
Public Document and Reversion of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
property, and denied I.S. Case No. 362 filed by the Sta. Cruz Homeowners
Association against the same Heirs, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span>
and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Laiz</span> for Reversion of the same
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Complaint for
Falsification was dropped for lack of basis, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>
having been found to have perfected his rights to the land; while the complaint
for reversion was denied, the Association being without personality to seek
said remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="12">1 December 1980</st1:date>,
the Republic, as<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>petitioner,
apparently acting upon the recommendation of the Director of Lands, filed a
Complaint for cancellation of Free Patent No. 326416, Original Certificate of
Title No. P-29004, and Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-12335 and T-12416
with the then Court of First Instance of <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(Civil Case No. 3003).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Named as
defendants were the Heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>; the
Spouses <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span>; the Spouses <span class="SpellE">Laiz</span>,
and the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Koronadal</span>, <st1:place>South
 <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Essentially, the Republic claimed that actual
fraud and deception was practiced on the Director of Lands considering that the
Application for Free Patent and the Notice of Application for Free Patent were
accomplished after the death of the applicant Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span>,
in violation of Section 91 of the Public Land Law; and that the land was sold
within the prohibitory period of five (5) years contrary to Section 118 of the
same law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Traversing the Complaint, the defendants denied the commission of
any fraud stating that the application had been filed by Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> during his lifetime but was acted on officially
only after his death; that the sale of the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
property was made after the five-year prohibitory period; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>the Patent and Titles derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> are valid and binding against the whole world;
that <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Laiz</span>
were purchasers in good faith; and that majority of the protestants were mere
lessees while the rest had entered the land later as<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>plain squatters, the place being near the DOLE cannery site.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower Court dismissed the Complaint on 3
September 1985, declared the Free Patent as valid against the whole world and
the corresponding Original and Transfer Certificates of Title as legal and
binding, no fraud having been proven; that the property had become private land
by virtue of the titling thereof and, therefore, the Director of Lands no
longer had jurisdiction over the same; and that there was no violation of
Section 91 nor 118 of the Public Land Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An appeal was made to the Court of Appeals which affirmed said judgment <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">toto</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>on <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="8">13 August 1987</st1:date> except as to costs against the Government.</p>

that:</p>

5.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify"><u>The Issue of Falsification<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General maintains that the falsification lies in
the fact that although Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> died on <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="10">10 October 1962</st1:date> (Exhibit
"H"), when the Application for Free Patent was filed on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="10">11 October 1963</st1:date>, or one year after
his death, somebody appeared before the Lands Inspector with Residence
Certificate No. A-4968202, issued at <span class="SpellE">Polomolok</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="18" month="2">18

the Application (Exhibits "G", <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">G-1"
</span>to "G-5").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> himself is also said to have appeared, signed and
sworn to the truth of the fact that notices regarding his filing of an
application had been posted at the required places (Exhibits "J",
"J-1" and "J-2").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those false entries, therefore, according to the Solicitor General, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ipso</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> <u>fact</u> of </span>produced the cancellation of the patent and

<p class="BODY">Like the Courts below, we are not persuaded that falsification
attended the filing of the Application for Free Patent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be recalled that in a Second <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> of the District Land Office, dated 11 July
1973, its Officer, Buenaventura M. Gonzales, stated that the lot in question
was applied for by Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Felisilda</span> under Free
Patent No. 37-175, on 11 October 1960 (Exhibit “3").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That was during his lifetime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Application was not acted on, however,
until much later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it was
formally considered only on <st1:date year="1963" day="11" month="10">11

<p class="BODY">It is true that under Section 122 of the Land Registration Act<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a title </span>issued on the basis of a

Director of Lands as to how such title had been acquired, if the purpose of
such investigation is to determine whether or not fraud had been committed in
securing such title in order that the appropriate action for reversion may be
filed by the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rationale <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> has been explained, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is true that under Section 122 of the Land Registration
Act, a Torrens title issued on the basis of a free patent or a homestead patent
is as indefeasible as one judicially secured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And in repeated previous decisions of this Court that indefeasibility
has been emphasized by Our holding that not even the Government can file an
action for annulment, but at the same time, it has been made clear that an
action for reversion may be instituted by the Solicitor General, in the name of
the Republic of the Philippines (Director vs. De Luna, 110 Phil. 28; Republic
vs. The Heirs of C. Carle, 105 Phil. 1228; <span class="SpellE">Panimdim</span>
vs. Director, 11 SCRA 628; and the cases therein cited).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is to the public interest that one who
succeeds in fraudulently acquiring title to a public land should not be allowed
to benefit <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and the State should,
therefore, have an ever existing authority, thru its duly authorized officers,
to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the issuance of any such title,
to the end that the Republic, thru the Solicitor General or any other officer
who may be authorized by law, may file the corresponding action for the
reversion of the land involved to the public domain, subject thereafter to
disposal to other qualified persons in accordance with law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the indefeasibility of a
title over land previously public is not a bar to an investigation by the
Director of Lands as to how such title has been acquired, if the purpose of
such investigation is to determine whether or not fraud had been committed in
securing such title in order that the appropriate action for reversion may be
filed by the Government" (<span class="SpellE">Pinero</span> vs. Director of
Lands, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And in so far as the timeliness of the action of the Government
is concerned, it is basic that prescription does not run against the State
(Article 1108, Civil Code; Republic vs. Rodriguez, L-18967, January 31, 1966,
16 SCRA 53).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case law has also been:</p>

<blockquote>"When the government is the real party
in interest, and is proceeding mainly to assert its own rights and recover its
own property, there can be no defense on the ground of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
or limitation" (Government of the U.S. vs. Judge of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">49 </span>Phil.

31, 1965, 15 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">681).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Public land fraudulently included in patents or certificates
of title may be recovered or reverted to the State <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

provides that lands acquired under Free Patent shall not be subject to
encumbrance or alienation from the date of the approval of the application and
for a term of five years from and after the date of the issuance of the patent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the Free Patent was issued on <st1:date year="1967" day="14" month="4">14 April 1967</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And yet, barely three (3) years after its

proceedings covering the land in question (Exhibit "E-1-1").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records likewise indicate that after
respondent <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span> had acquired the property he
caused the same to be subdivided into small lots and announced himself <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>owner (Exhibits "K",
"K-1" to"K-4").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, on <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="9">29 September 1970</st1:date>
in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>Contract to Sell, he sold

13.0pt">"K-9" to "K-12").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, he was already exercising acts of ownership.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion is inevitable, therefore, that <span class="SpellE">Felisilda's</span>
widow had disposed of the land within the prohibitory period because <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>she herself stated she needed money
to finance her medical expenses (Exhibit "E", p.3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provision of the law which prohibits the
sale or encumbrance of the homestead within five years after the grant of the
patent is mandatory, the purpose of the law being to promote a definite public
policy, which is to preserve and keep in the family of the patentee that
portion of the public land which the State has gratuitously given to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Deeds of Sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Felisilda's</span>
widow only on 14 June 1972 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span>
(Exhibit "4") and <span class="SpellE">Laiz</span> (Exhibit
"5") cannot overcome the fact that as early <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>1970 <span class="SpellE">Serranillo</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>already exercising acts of
ownership over the land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indications
are that the sales were actually perfected within the prohibitory period but
the Deeds of Sale were made to appear as executed only on 14 June 1972 or five
(5) years and two (2) months after the issuance of the Patent on 14 April 1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 1972 Deeds were evidently merely
confirmatory documents designed to circumvent the prohibition against
alienation within a period of five (5) years.</p>

<blockquote>"The law prohibiting any transfer or alienation of homestead
land within five years from the issuance of the patent does not distinguish
between <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and consummated sales; and it would
hardly be in keeping with the primordial aim of this prohibition to preserve
and keep in the family of the homesteader the piece of land that the state had
gratuitously given to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To hold
valid a homestead sale actually perfected during the period of prohibition but
with the execution and the delivery of possession of the land sold to the buyer
deferred until after the expiration of the prohibitory period, purposely to circumvent
the very law that prohibits and declares invalid each transaction to protect
the homesteader and his family (<span class="SpellE">Mansano</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, L-14778, February 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 691, 697).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The authority of the Director of Lands to investigate
circumstances leading to the issuance of the patent after the same had been
issued is beyond question as heretofore discussed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, too, his decision as to questions

is conclusive (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Calibo</span>

is that we find ourselves in disagreement with his finding that the Patent had
been fraudulently issued and that there was falsification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the charge of Falsification of
Public Document was rejected twice in succession by the Resolution of the
