<blockquote>"In Civil Case No. 3762 entitled Juan Castro and Feliciana
Castro v. Benita Castro, the plaintiffs filed an action for partition of
properties against the defendant alleging, among other things, that they are
the forced heirs of Pedro Castro who died in <span class="SpellE">Mayantoc</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> on <st1:date year="1923" day="27" month="5">May

Benita Castro Naval alleging, among other things, that they are also compulsory
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro who died in <span class="SpellE">Mayantoc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> on August 24,
1961 and that they are entitled to the partition of the properties of said
deceased (p. 32, Record on Appeal).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendants in their amended answer in both cases allege
that Benita Castro Naval is the only child of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
and that said <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro is the son of Pedro
Castro, therefore, the complaint for partition has no cause of action (p. 25,
Record on Appeal).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With leave of Court, plaintiffs filed their amended
complaints whereby they converted the original action for partition into an
action for quieting of title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant's husband <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> Naval was
forthwith <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as party-defendant (p. 32, Record
on Appeal).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, defendant Benita Naval filed a petition for
appointment as receiver and for preliminary injunction in Civil Case No.
3762.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, however, denied
said petition for appointment of receiver, but granted the petition for writ of
preliminary injunction and also adjudged <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>
Bautista who is the plaintiff in Civil Case No. 3762 guilty of contempt and
ordering her to pay a fine of P100.00 (p. 97, Record on Appeal).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that evidence in these incidents of appointing a
receiver and preliminary injunction as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">as </span>the motion for contempt were related to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">merits </span>of the case, the parties

merits.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

child of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of this stipulation, defendant Benita
Naval was allowed to introduce evidence to show that she was indeed the
acknowledged natural child of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The evidence on record shows that Juan Castro and Feliciana
Castro, plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 3762 and <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
Castro who <span class="GramE">was</span> already dead were the children of the
deceased spouses Pedro Castro and Cornelia Santiago.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> Bautista,
one of the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 3763, is the surviving spouse of the

<span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> (Exhibit A).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro, who caused the registration
of said birth gave the date indicated in the civil registry that he was the
father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Benita Castro was later baptized
in the Roman Catholic Church of <span class="SpellE">Camiling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, wherein the baptismal certificate appeared that her
parents are deceased <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro and <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span> <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span> (Exhibit
C).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
Castro died, pictures were taken wherein the immediate members of the family in
mourning were present, among <span class="GramE">whom</span> was Benita Castro
Naval (Exhibits D and D-1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this
score, the plaintiffs in their complaint in Civil Case No. 3762 admitted that
defendant Benita C. Naval is the forced heir of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
Castro and a compulsory heir of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro in
Civil Case No. 3763.</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>, the natural mother of Benita C. Naval who
was a resident of <span class="SpellE">Mayantoc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
was wedded to Felix de Maya of <span class="SpellE">Anoling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camiling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> against her
wishes on May 23, 1913.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the
celebration of the wedding in <span class="SpellE">Anoling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camiling</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Tarlac</span></span>
was going on, the guests soon found out that <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span> <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span> surreptitiously left the party and went to the
house of her first cousin <span class="SpellE">Bernarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagarigan</span> at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Malacampa</span>,
also in <span class="SpellE">Anoling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camiling</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, and there she cried that she did not want to get
married to Felix de Maya.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That evening <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span> proceeded to Barrio San <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Mayantoc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, where she
united with her real sweetheart, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro,
the father of Benita Castro Naval.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“”Antonio <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>, the
brother of <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span> <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>
who was then in the wedding party learned of the disappearance of his sister.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He finally found her living with <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
few days later <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro accompanied by two
persons went to the parents of <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span> <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span> at <span class="SpellE">Mayantoc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> and informed them that <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span>
was already living with him as husband and wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pricola's</span> parents
merely submitted to their daughter's wishes, so <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
Castro and <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span> <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>
lived as husband and wife until the death <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of

Castro at the time he lived with <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span> <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>, was a widower, and was, therefore, free to marry <span class="SpellE">Pricola</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result

properties left by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These properties
are the subject of the civil cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
stated earlier, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue raised in this petition is whether or not
respondent Benita Castro Naval is the acknowledged and recognized illegitimate

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> recognition of Benita Castro
as a natural child of <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> Castro appears in the
records of birth and partition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Recognition shall be made in the record of birth, a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">will, </span>a statement before a court of
record, or any authentic writing (Art. 278, Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a voluntary recognition already
established which did not need any judicial pronouncement (Gut, 68 Phil. 385;
Root v. Root, (CA), <span class="GramE">71</span> O.G. 3061).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Onteclaro</span>, 74 Phil. 393, the Supreme Court clarified the
distinction between voluntary recognition and compulsory recognition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, a voluntary recognition
is made in a public document, whereas in the indubitable writing under Article
135 is a private document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Manresa</span>, Vol. 1, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">p. </span>579).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">father </span>would ordinarily be more
careful about what he said in a public document <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">than </span>in a private writing, so that even an incidental mention of
the child as his in a public document <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">deserves
</span>full faith and credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
second place, in an action on Article 131 (voluntary recognition) the natural
child merely asks for a share in the inheritance in virtue of his having been
acknowledged as such, and is not trying to compel the father or his heirs to
make the acknowledgment, whereas the action based on Article 135 is to compel
the father or his heirs to recognize the child.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the former case, acknowledgment has been formally and legally
accomplished because the public character of the document makes judicial
pronouncement unnecessary, while in the latter case, recognition is yet to be
ordered by the courts because a private writing, lacking the stronger guaranty
and higher authenticity of a public document, is not self-<span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A judgment in favor of the
status of a natural child according to Art.</span> 135 must therefore be based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">on an express recognition so found and declared
by the court after hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this
juncture, it is to be noted that an action </span>based on voluntary
acknowledgment may be brought after the death of the father, but not an action
to compel acknowledgment, as a general rule, (Art. 137, Civil Code) which shows
the liberality of the law as to voluntary recognition, and its strictness
toward compulsory acknowledgment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"While it is true that
<span class="SpellE">Pricola</span> <span class="SpellE">Maregmen</span>, Benita's
mother was married to Naval (sic), it is the rule, however, that in case the
recognition is made by only one of the parents, it will be presumed that the
child </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">natural if </span>the
parents recognizing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it had the legal

that apart from reporting the birth of a child, he should al</span>so have
signed the certificate and seen to it that it was preserved for 60 years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or that he should have taken all legal steps
