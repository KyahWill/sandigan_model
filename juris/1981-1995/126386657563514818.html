shot Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Biniegas</span>, all the four <span style="">fled toward the same direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was deliberate, sudden and unexpected
attack on the person of Bernardino <span class="SpellE">Biniegas</span> who

repel the assault.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly convicted the appellants but erred <span style="">in </span>the imposition of the penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals then made the following
corrections:</p>

Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, murder is punishable by reclusion
temporal in its maximum period to death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The imposable penalty which has three periods, namely, minimum
(reclusion temporal), medium (reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>) and
the maximum (death), makes Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code
applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the
prosecution was able to establish the qualifying aggravating <span class="SpellE">circumstancs</span> of treachery and abuse of superior strength
and the ordinary aggravating circumstance of nighttime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, abuse of superior strength and
nighttime or <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> are absorbed by
treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v<span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz,
147 <span style="">SCRA 359) </span>In the absence of
any mitigating circumstance, the imposable penalty should be <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, the medium period of the penalty pursuant
to Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
