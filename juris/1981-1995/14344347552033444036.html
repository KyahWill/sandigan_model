CV No. 06979, promulgated on July 23, 1987, which reversed and set aside the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> of the Regional Trial Court of Tarlac, Branch 67, and its (Court of Appeals) resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[***]</sup> denying the petitioner's motion for reconsideration.<p></p><p>The facts may be summarized as follows:</p><p>Eliseo F. Marquez, in his lifetime, contracted four marriages successively with the following: Rufina Velasco, mother of Maria Pilar Marquez (Pilar, hereinafter) the petitioner herein; Sergia Obcena, mother of Maria Paz Marquez (Paz, hereinafter), the principal private respondent; Carmen Sumo; and Agrifina Meris, who survived him upon his death on December 9, 1947.</p><p>While Eliseo Marquez had six other living children, four of the third marriage and two of the fourth marriage (a third child, a son, predeceased him), the controversy before us centers only on two of his daughters by the earlier marriages, Pilar, his only child by the first marriage, and Paz, one of the two daughters of the second marriage (the other being Rosario Marquez who predeceased Eliseo), and the lots in controversy are only Lots Nos. 3428 and 4296.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="50%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">I. </td><td width="90%">Special Proceedings</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>No. 306.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This case was instituted by his fourth wife in her capacity as administratrix before the Court of First Instance of Tarlac (now Regional Trial Court). In the inventory of the personal and real properties of Eliseo submitted to the court, the following parcels of land were included: (1) Lot No. 3428 which is covered by Original Certificate of Title (hereinafter, OCT) No. 13810; (2) Lot No. 4296, covered by OCT No. 13837; (3) Lot No. 4373, covered by OCT No. 13778; (4) Lot No. 2113, covered by OCT No. 17580; and (5) Lot No. 4063, covered by OCT No. 14180. Pilar claims to have inherited these lots from her mother (Rufina). Thus, she opposed the inclusion of the said lots in the inventory and at the same time demanded the reconveyance thereof from the other heirs actually in possession, principally from Paz and the latter's children, but to no avail. Without waiting for the termination of the special proceedings, she filed a complaint, dated April 12, 1973, with the caption and title immediately hereinbelow specified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="50%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">II.</td><td width="90%">Civil CaseNo. 4895, entitled <em>"MariaPilar</em></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><em>Marquez vs. Amanda Marquez, etc.,</em></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><em>Maria Paz Marquez. et al."</em> CFI, Tarlac</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>[now RTC, Tarlac, Branch LXIII (63)].</td></tr></tbody></table><p>In her complaint, Pilar alleged, among others, that: 1) the aforementioned lots were inherited by Rufina (Pilar's mother) from her deceased parents and upon Rufina's death, these lots were inherited by her, she being the only child of Rufina and Eliseo; 2) she was only two years old when her mother died and so the possession, management, and administration of the said properties were entrusted to her father; 3) her father, through fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of trust, declared four of the said lots (Lots Nos. 4373, 2113, 4296, and 3428) as his and Rufina's conjugal partnership properties enabling him to register one-half portion of the said lots in his name. Lot No. 4063 was declared as his and Sergia's (wife no. 2) conjugal partnership property; 4) through fraud, misrepresentation, and breach of trust, her father adjudicated the remaining ½ portion of Lot 4296 and ¼ portion of Lot No. 3428 in the names of his daughters by his second marriage, Paz and Rosario Marquez (the latter predeceased Eliseo) in equal shares; 5) in his lifetime, Eliseo was in possession of those portions registered in his name and enjoyed the fruits thereof. And so did Paz as regards 1/4 of Lot No. 4296 and 1/8 of Lot No. 3428.</p><p>Pilar prayed <em>inter alia</em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><blockquote><p><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center" border="0" width="80%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">1) </td><td width="90%"><div align="justify">That the defendant, Amando L.

But instead of filing the required compromise agreement, Pilar submitted a "Motion To Implement Order and Issuance of Judgment," which was opposed by Paz. The court granted the motion and accordingly the case was deemed submitted for decision on the bases of the proposals and counter-proposals.</p><p>On January 24, 1979, a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> was rendered which reads in part:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>It is noted by the Court it was only the defendant Maria Paz Marquez who was retracting from the previous agreement made during the pre-trial conference and all other defendants want to abide with the agreement.</p><p>WHEREFORE, finding nothing illegal in the proposal and counter proposal agreed upon among the parties, the same is approved and parties are ordered and enjoined to comply strictly with the terms and conditions thereof.</p></blockquote><p>The defendants, including Paz, appealed the decision of the trial court to the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. No. 06414-R. In a resolution promulgated on February 13, 1981, the appeal was dismissed due to defendants-appellants' failure to tile their brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> On March 12, 1981, the resolution became final and executory. "Entry of Judgment" was issued on April 9, 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p><p>Consequently, a writ of execution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> was issued by the trial court on July 10, 1981, but because the same was returned unsatisfied for the reason that the properties subject thereof were not properly described therein, an <em><em>alias</em></em> writ<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> was issued on October 28, 1981 on Pilar's motion. The <em>alias</em> writ was, as shown by the Sheriffs 1st Indorsement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> fully satisfied, the shares of Paz having been delivered to her daughter, Luz Jo Manaois.</p><p>After about two months from the rendition of the decision of January 24, 1979, or on April 3, 1979, Paz sold her "undivided share" in Lot No. 4296 in favor of her son, Eliseo M. Jo, which sale was registered in the Registry of Deeds of Tarlac only on May 29, 1981.</p><p>On August 7, 1984, Pilar sought the issuance of titles in her name over the lots adjudicated to her under the January 24, 1979 decision, but, because transfer could not be effected without the OCTs, on her motion, the trial court ordered the defendants to surrender to it the OCTs over the subject lots. Instead of surrendering the required OCTs, Paz filed, on August 28, 1984, a "Motion to Clarify Decision,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which the trial court granted in an order dated September 7, 1984," declaring that the January 24, 1979 decision is not binding on Paz. On the strength of the said "clarificatory" order, Paz moved for the cancellation of the notice of <i>lis pendens </i>annotated at the back of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 77540 (formerly Original Certificate of Title No. 13810) covering Lot No. 3428. The motion was granted although the trial court explicitly recognized that the decision of January 24, 1979 had "become final and executory." This lot was the subject of a Deed of Donation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> executed by Paz in favor of her daughter on July 6, 1984, the date the order of cancellation was issued.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><table  ="" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="50%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="10%">III.</td><td width="90%">Civil Case No. 059-P '85 entitled, </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>"<em>Maria Pilar Marquez vs. Maria</em></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><em>Paz Marquez, et al.</em>" Regional Trial </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>Court, 3rd Judicial Region, Paniqui,</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>Tarlac, Branch LXVII (67).</td></tr></tbody></table><p>By virtue of the final and executory decision dated January 24, 1979 in Civil Case No. 4895, Pilar filed, on January 29, 1985, a complaint for "Annulment of Document and Title, with Damages."

Pilar avers that since her half sister, private respondent Paz, is a party litigant in Civil Case No. 4895, she (Paz) is barred from denying the adjudication of certain parcels in favor of Pilar in accordance with their proposals and counterproposals, because she (Paz) too was adjudicated Lot No. 4063, in addition to her share in nine (9) other lots over which the petitioner, Pilar, waived her rights as a trade-off for the four (4) lots already adjudicated in her favor. She argues that to countenance the alleged repudiation by Paz of what had been agreed upon in the pre-trial, after the latter had derived and enjoyed the benefits therefrom, would be contrary to equity and puts a premium on fraud or misrepresentation. She asserts that the "clarificatory order" of September 7, 1984 is unavailing to create rights favorable to Paz.</p><p>Private respondent Paz, on the other hand, submits that a decision was indeed rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Tarlac, Branch 63, based on the parties' (including her) proposals and counter-proposals. She alleges, though, that the said decision is incomplete and vague as it failed to mention the obligations and liabilities of the parties thereto, more particularly, her obligations and liabilities in view of her retraction. She argues that because she had nothing to do with those proposals and counter-proposals, the decision rendered in accordance therewith can not be binding upon her, as the same could not have attained finality without her participation. She proffers that the clarificatory order issued by the Regional Trial Court of Tarlac, Branch 63, was necessary in order to clarify the mistake or ambiguity in the dispositive portion thereof brought about by the discrepancy between the body of the decision and its dispositive portion.</p><p>Contrary however to the allegation of Paz, there is really no variance-between the body of the decision and its dispositive part. When the trial court enjoined the parties to comply strictly with the terms and conditions of the proposals and counter-proposals, it referred to the plaintiff, the petitioner herein, and all the defendants, including Paz, now the private respondents.</p><p>The claim of Paz that she did not appeal the decision of January 24, 1979 because she knew that the same is not binding on her is not true; it is belied by the records, it appearing from the resolution of the Court of Appeals (Sixth Div.) in CA-G.R. No. 06414-R, promulgated on February 13, 1981, dismissing the appeal, that she was a party appellant. As previously stated, the judgment of January 24, 1979 became final and executory on March 12, 1981, entered on April 9, 1981, and was fully implemented on November 7, 1981, as shown by the Sheriffs 1st Indorsement dated January 30, 1984. The motion for clarification is a belated attempt of Paz to reopen an already executed decision. The trial court should not have acted on the said motion because with the finality of the decision and the full implementation of the writ of execution, the judge had no more jurisdiction to issue any clarificatory order. It is too late in the day to have the case reopened or relitigated anew. The controversy had long been laid to rest.&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>By and large the trial court and the appellate court may have committed an error in the assignment or partition of eight parcels of land to the parties in their case, but considering that the judgments are now final, the error, assuming that one was committed, can no longer be amended or corrected. We have consistently held that one of the purposes for which courts are organized is to put an end to controversy in the determination of the respective rights of the contending parties. With the full knowledge that courts are not infallible, the litigants submit their respective claim for judgment and they have a right at sometime or another to have final judgment on which they can rely as a final disposition of the issue or issues submitted, and to know that there is an end to the litigation (Miranda vs. Court of Appeals, 71 SCRA 295). Likewise settled is the rule that after a judgment has become final, no additions can be made thereto, and nothing can be done therewith except its execution, otherwise there would be no end to legal processes (Fabular vs. Court of Appeals, 119 SCRA 339).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></p></blockquote><p>This finality rule is reiterated in a recent case<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> where the Court emphasized:&nbsp; </p><blockquote><p>Once a decision becomes final, the Court can no longer amend or modify the same, much less set it aside. To allow the Court to amend the final judgment will result in endless litigation (<em>Del Carmen vs. CA</em>, G.R. No. L-36021, February 29, 1980). Every litigation must come to an end. Access to the court is guaranteed. But there must be a limit to it. Once a litigant's right has been adjudicate in a valid final judgment of a competent court, he should not be granted an unbridled license to come back for another try. The prevailing party should not be harassed by subsequent suits. For, if endless litigation were to be encouraged, scrupulous litigants will multiply in number to the detriment of the administration of justice (<em>Ngo Bun Tiong vs. Judge Sayo</em>, G.R. No. L-45825, June 30, 1988).</p><p>We take this occasion again to express our extreme disapproval at litigants dissipating the valuable time of Court by resurrecting cases, which, to all legal intents and purposes, are long dead and buried. Cases already decided with finality have no second lives.</p></blockquote><p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is GRANTED, the challenged decision and resolution of the Court of Appeals are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE, and the decision of the Court of First Instance of Tarlac, Branch I (now Regional Trial Court, Tarlac, Branch 63), in Civil Case No. 4895, is REINSTATED.
