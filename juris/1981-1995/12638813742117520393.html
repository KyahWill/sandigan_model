statement of the respondent judge that </span><u>Criminal</u> <u>Case</u> <u>No</u>.
<u>1127</u>, <span style="">like </span>Criminal Case

</span>While it is true that Section 2, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court provides
that no appeal or stay of the proceedings shall be allowed whatever is the
ruling of the judge on his competency, said restriction does not apply in
criminal cases where the motion for disqualification was filed by the prosecution
and the same </span>was <span style="">denied, the
reason being, in the event of acquittal, the prosecution has no remedy
available as double jeopardy will set in.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

</span>Under Section 17 of the Judiciary Act, the Supreme Court has concurrent

the fact that the grounds that would be raised therein were already stated in
the motion for disqualification and the issues were discussed lengthily in the
oral arguments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, a motion for
reconsideration may be dispensed with in this case due to the urgency of the
writs and because the question raised is purely one of law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bariales</span> (L-39962, 3 March
1977), the Supreme Court held that while under Section 2, Rule 110 of the Rules
of Court, police, constabulary and other peace or law enforcement officers and
private prosecutors may prosecute criminal cases in municipal and city courts
which do not have their own fiscals, such authority, however, ceases upon
intervention of the provincial fiscal or their assistants or upon the elevation
of the case to the Court of First Instance (now RTC).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Aside from being drastic, the court cannot help entertain the
idea, in relation with the other case just mentioned (Criminal Case No. 1127),
that this case is a superfluity as much as a harassment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, he has concluded that <span class="SpellE">Legaspe</span>
is a victim of harassment and that Criminal Case No. 1148 should not have been
filed at all in view of Criminal Case No. 1127; hence, according to him, the
former is a "superfluity." Yet, respondent Judge is fully aware of

be legally prohibited from sitting in litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when suggestion <span style="">is </span>made of record that he might be induced to act in favor of one
party or with bias or prejudice against a litigant arising out of circumstance

that the people's faith in the courts of justice is not impaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A salutary norm is that he reflect on the probability

judge had <span class="SpellE">unmeritoriously</span> tilted the scales of
justice against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That passion on the
part of a judge may be generated because of serious charges of misconduct
against him by a suitor or his counsel, is not altogether remote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a man, subject to the frailties of
other men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should, therefore,
exercise great care and caution before making up his mind to act or withdraw
from a suit where that party or counsel is involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could in good grace inhibit himself where
that case could be heard by another judge and where no appreciable prejudice
would be occasioned to others involved therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the result of his decisions to sit or not to <span style="">sit </span>may depend to a great extent the all-important confidence in
the impartiality of the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
after reflection he should resolve to voluntarily <span style="">desist from sitting in a case where his motives or fairness might be
seriously impugned, his action is to be interpreted as giving meaning and
substance to the second paragraph </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">Section 1, Rule 137.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He serves the cause of the law who forestalls

Neither is the mere filing of an administrative case against a judge a ground

the immediate inhibition of the judge on the basis alone of his being so
