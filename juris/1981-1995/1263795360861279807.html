exemption of their landholdings situated in <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, from the coverage of Operation Land Transfer
is hereby granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
Certificates of Land Transfer covering said lands issued to the tenants thereof
are hereby recalled and cancelled; however, said tenants shall remain in the
peaceful possession and cultivation of their respective <span class="SpellE">farmholdings</span>
as agricultural lessees thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">To the said Order of
October 5, 1983, herein petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, arguing
that (a) the provisions of LOI 474 issued on October 21, 1976 apply to the
landholding in question; and (b) the transfer of the subject landholdings,
having been executed prior to October 21, 1972 but not registered with the
Register of Deeds concerned before said date in accordance with the Land Registration
Act (Act No. 496) shall not be considered a valid transfer insofar as the
tenants-farmers are concerned and </span>therefore the land should be placed
under Operation Land <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Transfer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In an Order dated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">May </span>28,
1984 (Ibid., pp. 64-66), respondent Minister of Agrarian Reform denied
petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration on the grounds that (1) petitioners
failed to submit any evidence that the private respondents have other
agricultural lands; and (2) the authenticity and due execution of the deeds of
sale on July 13, 1972 have been certified to by the Acting Clerk of Court,
Regional Trial Court of Manila in his Certification dated April 22, 1983, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">this being so, there is no fraudulent
transfer, much less marked fraudulent transfer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed an Appeal with the Office of the President,
docketed therein as O. P. Case No. 2762.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners premised their appeal on the grounds that (1) the act of
registration is the operative act that conveys and affects the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">land; </span>(2) under LOI No. 474, all
tenanted rice/corn lands <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">are </span>subject
to operation land transfer pursuant to PD 27; and (3) payments have already
been made to the Land Bank of the Philippines covering their respective
landholdings.</p>

findings and conclusion that (1) herein petitioners were notified of the sale

this </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">fact </span>was never <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> at any stage by petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">they
are bound even if the registration of said transfers were made only after the
promulgation of PD 27; (2) herein private respondents' landholdings are not
covered by LOI No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">474 </span>since the
area of each landholding does not exceed seven hectares; and (3) the payments
made by herein petitioners represent "advance deposit" or
"farmers deposit" </span>and not monthly amortizations of a supposed sale
of landholdings to them.</p>

at any stage of the proceedings by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners insist before respondents MAR and the Office of the
President, that private respondents own other lands planted to rice and corn in
order obviously to bring this case within the coverage of the Operation Land
Transfer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pursuant to PD 27.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The former however failed to adduce evidence
to support their allegation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, he who alleges </span>a fact has the burden of proving it
and a mere allegation is not evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Top Weld Manufacturing Inc. vs. ECED, S.A., 138 SCRA 118 [1985]
citing <span class="SpellE">Legasca</span> vs. De Vera, 69 Phil. 376).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the evidence as found by respondent MAR
clearly shows that subject landholdings were part of a big land area and that
portions thereof were sold to private respondents, the total of which is less
than seven (7) hectares to each of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, it was also found by respondent MAR and affirmed on appeal
by the Office of the President that none of private respondents "own other
agricultural lands of more than seven (7) hectares in aggregate area or lands
used for residential, commercial, industrial, or other urban purposes from
which they derive sufficient income to support themselves and their
families." <span class="GramE">(Comment, Solicitor General, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 91-93).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is evident that there
is no dispute as to the requisites of a valid contract of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners even agree with respondents that
the contract of sale (to them) in the case at bar is understandably peculiar in
the sense that the parties were practically forced to agree
voluntarily".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A contract of sale
under PD 27, as petitioners assert, is one created by operation of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 8).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But petitioners missed the
point all together that PD 27, the agreed basis of Operation Land Transfer is
not applicable, precisely because none of the areas taken exceeds seven (7)
hectares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence as correctly observed by the Solicitor General, there could
hardly be any "meeting of the minds" between herein petitioners and
private respondents, as sellers and buyers, respectively, of the
landholdings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no assent and
concurrence of the parties to the forced sale of said landholdings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such forced sales of the subject
landholdings, upon a mistaken application of the Operation Land Transfer by way
of implementing PD 27, was obviously made under circumstances that certainly
negated consent on the part of herein private respondents as sellers
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 94).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Without consent nor the law to justify the compulsion of such
transfer, no valid and legal contract of sale, involving the subject
landholdings, is possible.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span class="GramE">III.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Neither can the continuous payments of rentals
to the previous registered owners and</span> to herein private respondents as
the new owners thereof by the tenants to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Land Bank of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> be considered as the agreed </span>cause or
consideration of the forced sale of subject landholdings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As established, such payments were considered
by the MAR as "amortizations/part payments of the said land if the tenants
will prevail in the case or rentals if otherwise" (Annex "G"
Petition, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 36).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the receipts issued by the Land
Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
show that the payments made by appellants (petitioners herein) represent
"advance deposit" of "farmers deposit" and not monthly
amortizations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such deposits may be
withdrawn from the Land Bank by the petitioners as their landholdings do not
fall within the purview of the operation land transfer, as stated by the
Minister of Agrarian Reform and sustained by the Office of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Annex "H-3"
Petition, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 39).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Finally, two agencies of
the <span class="GramE">government,</span> MAR and Office of the President,
examined the evidence and came up with the same findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore without question that such
findings supported as they are by substantial evidence, should be
respected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In line with this view, the
Court has ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

submitted to the administrative agency concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The findings of fact must be respected, so
long as they are supported <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span>substantial
evidence, even if not overwhelming or preponderant." <span class="GramE">(Police
