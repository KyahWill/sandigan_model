				<H3>NIEVES D. IGNACIO, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE WILHELMINA T. MELANIO-ARCEGA, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>QUIASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A verified complaint of Nieves Ignacio charges respondent with Falsification
and Delay in the Administration of Justice relative to Criminal Case No. 151-92
for Robbery.  Complainant is a sister of
Avelino Ignacio, who is the complaining witness in said criminal case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Demetrio B. Macapagal, who was directed by this Court to
conduct an investigation on the matter, submitted his report and
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant alleged that a preliminary investigation was
conducted and terminated on October 5, 1992.  Since the accused admitted their participation in the robbery,
respondent told Avelino Ignacio that she would resolve the case within ten (10)
days and transmit the resolution to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 1, 1992, complainant went to the Office of the
Provincial Prosecutor to follow-up the status of the case.  She was informed that ??? it had not
received respondent's resolution.  That
same day, she went to the court to inquire about the failure to transmit the
court's resolution to the Provincial Prosecutor.  It was only when she arrived at the court that respondent started
preparing the draft of the resolution.  Complainant was told by one of the court employees that the resolution
would be transmitted to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor the following
day.  On December 9, 1992, she obtained
a copy of the resolution and noticed that it was dated October 20, 1992,
instead of December 1, 1992.  She went
back to respondent to question the date affixed to the resolution but she was
told that respondent was on vacation leave.  Thereafter, she decided to file an administrative complaint with this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her comment, respondent stated:  (1) that she met complainant for the first time on December 1,
1992, when the latter saw her regarding Criminal Case No. 151-92; (2) that she
prepared the resolution of the case on October 20, 1992 and ordered its
transmittal, but upon inquiry she found out that her staff had misplaced the
records; and (3) that upon learning of such negligence, she immediately
prepared <span style="">another resolution, which was
transmitted to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his report and recommendation, Judge Macapagal stated that
what mattered was the date of transmittal of the resolution (December 2, 1992)
and not the date appearing thereon (October 20, 1992).  He recommended that the charges against
respondent be dismissed for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We disagree with the
Investigating Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be noted that
the complaint against respondent is not </span>only <span style="">for Falsification but also for Undue Delay in </span><span style="">the Administration of Justice.  Regardless of whether or not there was an
ante-dating of the resolution, respondent has to answer for the late
transmittal thereof to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under Section 5, Rule 112
of the 1989 Rules on Criminal Procedure, it is required that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Within ten (10) days after the conclusion of the preliminary
investigation, the investigating judge shall transmit to the Provincial or City
fiscal, for appropriate action, the resolution of the case, stating briefly the
findings of fact and the law supporting his action, together with the entire
records of the case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Judges should dispose of the court's business promptly and within
the required periods (Aquino v. Luntok, 184 SCRA 177 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent conducted a preliminary investigation of the subject
criminal case on October 5, 1992 which was terminated also on said date.  She issued her resolution of the case on
October 20, 1992 or after the lapse of the ten-day reglementary period.  Worse, the resolution was transmitted to the
Office of the Provincial Prosecutor only on December 2, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it was inadvertence on the part of the court employees
which caused the delayed transmittal of the resolution, the burden of
responsibility rests on the shoulders of respondent.  She cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency or negligence of
the court personnel (Nidua v. Lazaro, 174 SCRA 581 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent is FINED in the amount of P1,000.00,
and is WARNED that a repetition of the same or similar offense <span style="">will </span>be dealt with more severely.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">SO ORDERED<span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></p>
