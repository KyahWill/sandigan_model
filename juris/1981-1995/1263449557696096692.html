				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal had to be interposed by petitioner due to the fact
that after a decision was rendered <span style="">in
his </span>favor admitting him to Philippine citizenship, he was prevented from
taking his oath as such be足cause, as pointed out in the appealed order:
"Although the decision here was rendered on April 20, 1967, it is well
settled that the same has not become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and again, it has been held that the
applicant's qualifications, as well as his disquali足fications for
naturalization may still be inquired into even at this stage of the case,
because a decision in <span style="">a naturalization
case does not become final until the applicant was issued a Certificate of
Naturali足zation after he had shown that he had already complied with the
conditions under Section 1 of Republic Act No. 530 and had taken oath of
allegiance to the Republic (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chin Guan v.

that his character witnesses did not know him "well enough" during
the entire period of his residence in this country and that in his student days
he had been using an alias without proper court authority.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> After the briefs were filed, the case was

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on March 9, 1981, a Manifestation and Motion was
filed by the Solicitor General stating "that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal of the above captioned case,
petitioner-appellant Juan Simon alias <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Chua,
filed an application <u>for naturalization</u> under Letter of Instruction No.
270 and, upon recom足mendation of the Special Committee on Naturalization, was
granted Philippine Citizenship on April 20, 1976, pursuant to Presidential
Decree No. 923.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies of <span style="">his Oath of Allegiance and Certificate of
Naturalization are hereto attached as Annex '1' and '2', respectively."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The prayer was for the dismissal of the case
