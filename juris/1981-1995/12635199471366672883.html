<p class="BODY">Petitioners' original and amended complaints alleged that during
their lifetime the spouses <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> Guerrero and <span class="SpellE">Panay</span> Ramos were the absolute owners of the disputed
property, which is a parcel of land located at San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, with an
area of 42,299 square meters, more or less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The spouses had six children, named Andres, Juliana, Aurelio, Leona,
Jose and Cristina, and all surnamed Guerrero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Panay</span> Ramos predeceased <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span>
Guerrero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before his demise, <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> Guerrero verbally willed and ordained that the questioned
lot be assigned and adjudicated to Andres Guerrero as his share in the
inheritance, the other children having been assigned other lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> Guerrero, Andres Guerrero physically possessed the
lot and cultivated it through his tenant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
Ramirez, who earned a 50% share in the net produce, the other 50% being
retained by Andres Guerrero who defrayed the cultivation expenses and real
estate taxes on the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly
after the beginning of the Japanese occupation, Andres Guerrero entrusted the
land to his sister, Cristina Guerrero, and allowed her to have the property
cultivated and to retain the owner's share in the harvests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arrangement between brother and sister
was that Cristina Guerrero could continue in the cultivation of the land and
enjoyment of the owner's share in the produce for as long as she needed the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Ramirez
continued his tenancy until shortly before the death of Andres Guerrero.
Sometime in July 1943, Andres Guerrero died survived by his widow, <span class="SpellE">Segunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Laquindanum</span>, and their
children, who are the petitioners in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Cristina Guerrero continued as trustee of the deceased Andres Guerrero.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaints further alleged that as early as <st1:date year="1957" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1957</st1:date>, the land was
surveyed by the Bureau of Lands for and in the name of Andres Guerrero as Lot
No. 4752, Case No. 4, <span class="GramE">Cadastre</span> No. 229 of the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span> Cadastre.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime during the latter part of 1971 certain people who introduced
themselves as agents or buyers of the land ap­proached some of the plaintiffs
in order to secure their consent to the sale of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said plaintiffs were informed that the land
was titled in the name of their cousin, Manuel Guerrero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs made inquiries and discovered the
following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that Manuel Guerrero was able
to have the lot titled in his name on the basis of a 'Deed of Sale of Land'
dated April 24, 1948 purportedly executed by Cristina Guerrero; that he caused
the lot to be surveyed in his name as Lot No. 4752 and he was issued advance
Plan No. AP-10008 on February 28, 1962; that in the advance plan issued to him,
it was duly noted that Lot No. 4752 had been previously surveyed for Andres
Guerrero; that in 1963, Manuel Guerrero, assisted by <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
Guerrero, father of the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span>, filed
an application for registration of land with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; that notwithstanding the opposition of the heirs of
Cristina Guerrero, the court ruled that Manuel Guerrero owned the lot; that
despite <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>' appeal to a higher court, the
Register of Deeds issued Original Certificate of Title No. 4591 to the
applicant; that on September 14, 1971, there was filed with the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a "Deed of Absolute Sale"
purportedly executed by Manuel Guerrero in favor of the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span>; that the Register of Deeds gave due course to
the registration of that deed, cancelled OCT No. 4591 and was issued Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 339629 in its stead; that on the same day that the
deed of sale was registered, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span>
caused to be notarized an "Articles of Partnership” of St. Clare's Realty
Company, Ltd., constituting themselves as partners; that on September 28, 1971,
the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span> sold the disputed lot in a
"Deed of Absolute Sale" to the St. Clare's Realty Com­pany, Ltd.;
that by virtue thereof, the Register of Deeds issued TCT No. 340842 in the name
of said realty company.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the original and amended complaints, the Deed of
Sale in favor of Manuel Guerrero was fraudulent, simulated and falsified for
the reason, among others, that Cristina Guerrero was not the owner of the land
at the time she purportedly sold it; that Manuel Guerrero obtained OCT No. 4591
in fraud of the plaintiffs; that the Deeds of Sale to the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span> and St. Clare's Realty Company, Ltd. and the
transfer certificates of title in their favor are fraudulent and simulated, and
ineffective against the plaintiffs for the reason, among others, that at the
time of execution of the Deeds of Sale, the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span>
knew that the property belonged to Andres Guerrero; that long after the complaint
in the present case has been filed, the plaintiffs came to know that the St.
Clare's Realty Company, Ltd. executed a "Joint Venture Agreement"
with the United Housing Corporation under which the latter bound itself to
develop the property into a residential subdivision; and that the said
agreement was entered into in gross and evident bad faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Separate answers were filed by the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span>,
St. Clare's Realty Company, Ltd. and United Housing Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span>
alleged that Cristina Guerrero was the absolute owner of the property; that the
action of the plaintiffs had prescribed and they are guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>St. Clare's
Realty Company, Ltd. averred that its contract with United Housing Corporation
was made in good faith. United Housing Corporation averred that there is no <span class="SpellE">privity</span> of interest between plaintiffs and this defendant
considering that the plaintiffs are not parties to the Joint Venture Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Issues having been joined; the case proceeded to trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Frisco Cervantes, grandson of Cristina Guerrero, testified as a
witness of the plaintiffs that having had previous information that the
disputed lot was borrowed from Andres Guerrero and that Cristina Guerrero
merely mortgaged it to Manuel Guerrero, he went to the house of Manuel Guerrero
in Barrio San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in 1968 at the behest of the plaintiffs, to
inquire about the mortgage; that in reply, Manuel Guerrero stated that the land
had been sold but it would be changed with another lot of the same area; that
in 1970, <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> Cervantes and Laura Cervantes,
children of Cristina Guerrero, and he went to see Manuel Guerrero at the Sta.
Rita Church in <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>
and Laura asked if they could get the land back; that Manuel Guerrero answered
that it were better to change the disputed lot with another parcel of the same
area and value; that as he was not satisfied with the answer, Frisco Cervantes
went to the Office of the Register of Deeds in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, where he obtained a copy of a Deed of Sale in
favor of Manuel Guerrero which he delivered to the children of Andres Guerrero.</p>

<p class="BODY">Roman <span class="SpellE">Mataverde</span>, Chief Geodetic
Engineer of the Bureau of Lands designated as Officer-In-Charge of the Surveys
Division, tes­tified for the plaintiffs that in the Bureau's Lot Data
Computation Book showing the list of claimants for <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
4752, Case 4, Cadastre 299, <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, (Exhibit A), which was surveyed on <st1:date year="1957" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1957</st1:date>, Andres Guerrero
is listed as claimant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records of
the Bureau of Lands from 1957 (when <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 4752 was <span class="SpellE">cadastrally</span> surveyed for Andres Guerrero) until 1962 show
no claimant to the property except Andres Guerrero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1962, the Bureau of Lands received a
letter with an affi­davit attached to it from Manuel Guerrero requesting that
an advance plan be made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Advance Plan
No. 10008 was made without Andres Guerrero being notified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But in the advance plan, the Bureau of Lands
listed Andres Guerrero as original claimant so that he would, not be pre­judiced
when a case comes to trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Ramirez testified that during
the rainy season of 1936, Andres Guerrero asked him to work on his land located
at Barrio San <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, with an area of four (4) hectares, more or
less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As tenant, his agreement with
Andres Guerrero was that he would till the land in consideration of 50% of the
harvests with Andres Guerrero shouldering the cultivation expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From 1936, to about 1941 or 1942, he worked
on the land and gave 50% of the produce to Andres Guerrero who went personally
to the field to get the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1941 or
1942, he stopped working on the land because war had broken out.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 19, 1973, Laura Cervantes testified that her mother,
Cristina Guerrero, had been sick for a long time before she died at the age of
80 years in 1948; and that her mother could walk only inside their house in <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>; that the money spent for the illness of her
mother came from Manuel Guerrero; and that, through her children, Cristina
Guerrero could ask money from Manuel Guerrero because of the land that Andres
Guerrero had lent to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">After Laura Cervantes had thus testified, counsel for the
defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span> objected to the line of
questioning on the ground that the said witness was testifying "on matters
which are prohibited under Sec. <span class="GramE">20(a</span>), Rule 130, of
the Rules of Court." The trial court having ruled that the witness
"may answer"<span class="GramE">,</span> defendants' counsel registered
a continuing objection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court
allowed the witness to continue her testimony subject to such objection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, pp. 9-20, October 19,
1973.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Resuming her testimony, Laura Cervantes stated that the land was
lent by Andres Guerrero to Cristina Guerrero; that Manuel Guerrero loaned money
to Cristina Guerrero for quite some time; that shortly after the death of
Cristina Guerrero, Manuel Guerrero went to their house, accompanied by <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> Guerrero, and summed up the loans he had
extended to Cristina Guerrero in the total amount of P1,900.00; and that <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> Guerrero asked Laura Cervantes to sign a piece
of paper to attest to the fact that a certain amount of money had been borrowed
from Manuel Guerrero.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1973</st1:date>,
the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span> filed a written motion to
disqualify Laura Cervantes as a witness on the basis of Section 20(a), Rule
130, of the New Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion
was opposed by the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1973</st1:date>, the trial court
granted the motion and declared that Laura Cervantes, Jose Cervantes as well as
other witnesses similarly situated, are disqualified to testify in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1974</st1:date>,
plaintiffs filed a "Motion <span class="GramE">For The Honorable Presiding
Judge Of This Honorable Court To Inhibit Himself And/Or To Transfer Case To
Another</span> Branch." Oppositions to the said motion were filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1974</st1:date>, the trial court denied the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the continuation of the trial on <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1974</st1:date>, plaintiffs and their counsel failed to
appear despite due notice and repeated previous warnings to their lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of appearing in court, plaintiffs,
thru counsel, filed an urgent motion to reset the hearing, which was opposed by
the defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On even date, the, court
issued an order as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the non-appearance of the plaintiffs as well as
their counsel for today's hearing, they are deemed to have waived their right
to further present or formally offer their evidence in court, and on motion of
defendants' counsels, the Clerk of Court, Atty. Juan A. <span class="SpellE">Carambas</span>,
is hereby authorized and commissioned to receive the evidence for the
defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the defendants have
closed their case, they are given 10 days within which to file their respective
memoranda and the case is deemed submitted for decision after receipt of the
complete transcript of stenographic notes." <span class="GramE">(Record on
Appeal, p. 212.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 22, 1974, plaintiffs filed a "Manifestation" to
the effect that they did not waive their rights to present further evid­ence,
to cross-examine defendants witnesses, and to present rebuttal evidence; and
that they were reserving the exercise of those rights upon the finality of the
decision of the Court of Appeals in a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> against the Presiding Judge of the trial court,
which they were then preparing to file.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, on <st1:date year="1974" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1974</st1:date>,
plaintiffs instituted the said special civil action, which was docketed in the
Court of Appeals as its CA-G.R. No. <span class="GramE">SF-03120.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The action sought the disqualification of the
trial judge from continuing with the hearing of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="6">June
 27, 1974</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals denied the petition outright.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Copy of the resolution was received by the
plaintiffs on <st1:date year="1974" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They filed a motion for recon­sideration on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="7">July

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1975</st1:date>,
plaintiffs perfected their appeal to the Court of Appeals where the case was
docketed as CA-G.R. No. 57597-R. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1981</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals
rendered its decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, all the foregoing considered, the decision
appealed from is hereby affirmed, with modification in regard to damages as
follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) for the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span>, P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> moral
damages, and P10,000.00 exemplary damages; (b) for the defendant St. Clare's

Housing Corporation, P40,000.00 for loss of goodwill and business reputation
and P10,000.00 exemplary damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
actual damages and attorney's fees 'are hereby maintained."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1981</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for review by <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their instant petition for review, petitioners have raised
substantive and procedural points on which the lower tribunals have allegedly
erred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The substantive issues refer to
the lack of basis for the grant of actual, moral and exemplary damages in the
huge amount of over two million pesos; and the error of ruling that the action
was barred by prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span>. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Petitioners underscore the procedural errors
they attribute to the lower courts which resulted in the deprivation of their
full opportunity to ventilate their case and prove the validity of their
claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They assail the ruling that their
witnesses Laura Cervantes, Jose Cervantes" and others similarly
situated" are disqualified to testify; and that they waived the right to
present their evidence when they failed to appear at a hearing set by the trial
judge during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of proceedings taken by the
petitioners to disqualify him due to alleged hostility manifested by the latter
towards the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this instance, <span class="GramE">We</span> consider it
unnecessary to discuss the substantive merits of the petitioners’ cause of
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record reveals that they
have not yet completed the presentation of their evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever evidence they had previously presented
were apparently not considered in the rendition of the questioned decisions for
not having been "formally offered."<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It does not strike <span class="GramE">Us</span> as fair and just that the
petitioners would be made answerable for damages in such a huge amount for
having filed an allegedly baseless and unfounded action without affording them
the full opportunity of establishing the merit of their claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the face of the record, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are convinced that they had been denied that chance due to some mistaken and
capricious application of pertinent pro­cedural rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first question of importance that engages the attention of
this Court is whether or not the witnesses Laura Cervantes and Jose Cervantes
were correctly disqualified from testifying in the case and their testimonies
excluded on the basis of Section 20(a), Rule 130, of the Rules of Court, which
provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 20.</span> <span class="GramE"><u>Disqualification
by reason of interest or relationship</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>– The following persons cannot testify as to
matters in which they are interested, directly or indirectly as herein enumerated:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Parties or assignors of parties to a case, or
persons in whose behalf a case is prosecuted, against an executor or
administrator or other representative of a deceased person, or against a person
of unsound mind, upon a claim or demand against the estate of such deceased
person or against such person of unsound mind, cannot testify as to any matter
of fact occurring before the death of such deceased person or before such
became of unsound mind."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts and under the law, this Court is fully persuaded
that the affirmative rulings of both the trial court and the Court of Appeals
were made in error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plain truth is
that Laura Cervantes and Jose Cervantes are not parties in the present case,
and neither <span class="GramE">are</span> they assignors of the parties nor
"persons in whose behalf a case is prosecuted." They are mere
witnesses by whose testimonies the plaintiffs aimed to establish that it was
not Cristina Guerrero, but Andres Guerrero, who owned the disputed land at the
time of its alleged sale to Manuel Guerrero; that Cristina Guerrero did not
really sell but merely mortgaged the property to Manuel Guerrero.</p>

<blockquote>"Following this rule of construction, it may be said that <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> to testify established in the provision above
quoted, affects only the persons therein mentioned, and no others, that is, only
parties plaintiff or their assignors, persons in whose behalf a case is
prosecuted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere witnesses who are
neither <span class="GramE">parties</span> plaintiff, nor their assignors, nor
persons in whose behalf a case is prosecuted, are not included in the
prohibition."<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Moran,
Com­ments on the Rules of Court, 1970 ed., Vol. 5, p. 166.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">By excluding the testimonies of the two
witnesses and by barring them from further testifying, upon reasoning that
unduly strained the meaning of the provisions of the Rules of Court relied
upon, the trial court deprived itself of the opportunity of knowing the truth
in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the present case is not a claim or demand against the
estate of the deceased Manuel Guerrero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span> are not the executors
or administrators or representatives of such deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are being sued as claimants of ownership
in their individual capacities of the disputed lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lot is not a part of the estate of Manuel
Guerrero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the
inapplicability of the dead man's rule.</span></p>

<blockquote>"It has been held that statutes providing that a party in
interest is incompetent to testify where the adverse party is dead or insane,
must be applied strictly in accordance with their express wording, irrespective
of their spirit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law uses the word
‘against an executor or administrator or other representative of a deceased
person.' It should be noted 'that after the mention of an executor or
administrator the words or other representative follows, which means that the
word 'representative' includes only those who, like the executor or
administrator, are sued n their representative, not personal, capacity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And that is emphasized by the law by using
the words ‘against the estate of such deceased persons’, which convey the idea
of an estate actually owned by the deceased at the time the case was brought
and that, therefore, it is only his rights that are to be asserted and
defendant in the litigation by the person representing him, not the personal
rights of such representative."<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Moran, <u>ibid</u>., pp. 169-171.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The next question that requires attention is whether or not the
exclusion of plaintiffs' evidence and their preclusion from presenting further
proof was correctly sustained by the respondent Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the issuance of the court's order of
June 14, 1974, by which the plaintiffs were "deemed to have waived their
right to further present or formally offer their evidence", the following
had testified as witnesses of the plaintiffs, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo Zamora, Roman <span class="SpellE">Mataverde</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Moises</span> <span class="SpellE">Javillonar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Ramirez, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span>, Frisco Cervantes, Laura Cervantes and Jose
Cervantes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was error to hold that the
testimonial evidence should have been formally offered, or that without such
offer, such evidence was waived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
offer of testimonial evidence is <span class="GramE">effected</span> by calling
the witness to the stand and letting him testify before the court upon
appropriate questions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Moran, Comments on the Revised Rules of Court, Vol. 6, 1970 ed.,
p. 122.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding rigid cross-examination conducted by the lawyers
of the defendants, the witnesses discovered the following facts:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the 1930's Andres Guerrero physically
possessed the disputed lot, paid the real estate taxes for it, had the same
cultivated through a tenant, defrayed the cultivation expenses, and exclusively
enjoyed the owner's share in the harvests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Andres Guerrero loaned the lot to his sister, Cristina Guerrero, before
he died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cristina Guerrero became ill
prior to the year 1948.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She could walk
only inside her house in <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The money
spent for her illness was borrowed from Manuel Guerrero.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the death of Cristina Guerrero, Manuel
Guerrero and <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> Guerrero came to her house
and the money loaned to her was <span class="SpellE">totalled</span> in the
amount of P1<span class="GramE">,900.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1957" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1957</st1:date>,
the questioned lot was <span class="SpellE">cadastrally</span> surveyed and
denominated as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 4752 of the <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>
Cadastre.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Andres Guerrero was the lone
claimant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Until 1962, no other person
claimed the lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing proofs bear materially on the questions raised by
the plaintiffs as to whether or not:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
Cristina Guerrero or Andres Guerrero owned the lot when the former purportedly
sold it to Manuel Guerrero in 1948; (2) Cristina Guerrero really sold or merely
mortgaged the land to Manuel Guerrero; (3) Manuel Guerrero and, after him, the
defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span> were buyers in good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of insulating itself from evidence
that could lead it to the truth, the trial court should have addressed itself
to the questions why:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) if it is true
that Cristina Guerrero was the owner of the disputed lot in 1948, the cadastral
surveyors who actually repaired to the field listed Andres Guerrero as the sole
claimant of the property; (2) until 1962, no other person except Andres Guerrero
claimed the lot as his own; (3) notwithstanding the purported deed of sale by
Cristina Guerrero to Manuel Guerrero was executed on April 24, 1948, it was
presented for registration with the Register of Deeds almost ten (10) years
later only on February 27, 1958 (TSN, p. 15, January 9, 1974); (4) in the deed
of sale to Manuel Guerrero, it is stated that he appeared in <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, before Atty.
Jose D. <span class="SpellE">Villena</span> who was a notary public in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; (5) the area of
the land bought by Manuel Guerrero was 33,090 square meters whereas the area of
the land sold by him to the defendants <span class="SpellE">Guerreros</span> was
42,299 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court also ought
rather to have noticed the fact that, in the deed of sale in favor of Manuel
Guerrero, it is stated that the subject parcel of land "is surrounded by
mud-dikes besides the stone monuments that visibly marked all its
boundaries", which clearly indicate a previous survey and which may in
turn lead to the question if the deed of sale to Manuel Guerrero "might
have been made after the cadastral survey in 1957 and not in 1948.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rendered its decision solely on the basis of the
defendants' evidence and without regard to the proofs that the plaintiffs had
presented on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1974</st1:date>
before the Court of Appeals could finally resolve plaintiffs' petition to
disqualify the trial judge. As modified by the Court of Appeals, the decision
sentences the plaintiffs to pay damages and attorney's fees, apart from the
costs of suit, in the staggering amount of Two Million One Hundred Eighty Three
Thousand and Five Hundred (P2<span class="GramE">,183,500.00</span>) Pesos,
without plaintiffs having been given the chance to complete their evidence, to
cross-examine the witnesses of the defense, and to present rebuttal
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The way the trial court and
the Court of Appeals <span class="GramE">proceeded</span> in this case,
litigation became more a game of technicalities than a proceeding to search the
truth and mete justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No other fairer
course of action is demanded but for this Court to remand the case for further
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the respondent Court of Appeals
is hereby set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let the records of
the case be remanded to the court of origin with instruction to the trial court
to allow the plaintiffs to complete their evidence, to cross-examine the
defendants' witnesses, and to present rebuttal evidence if they so desire, and
thereafter to decide the case anew.</p>
