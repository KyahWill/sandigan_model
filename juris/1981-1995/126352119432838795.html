On April 5, 1983, petitioner union staged a strike on issues of unfair 
Labor Practice, Union Busting, Refusal by Management to pay the casual 
period of retired personnel and Refusal by Management to implement the 
medical plan and temporary lay-off.
<p>
After several scheduled hearing and conferences, no settlement has been 
reached.  Respondent Minister of Labor assumed jurisdiction over the 
labor dispute and on May 20, 1983, he issued an order requiring all 
striking workers to return to work, the dispositive portion of which 
reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Minister of Labor and Employment 
hereby assumes jurisdiction over the labor dispute at Oceanic Pharmacal 
Inc., pursuant to Art. 264 (g) of the Labor Code as amended, all 
striking workers are hereby directed to return to work within 
seventy-two (72) hours from receipt of this order and management in 
turn, shall accept all returning workers under the same terms and 
conditions prevailing previous to the work stoppage.  The Bureau of 
Labor Relations is hereby directed to hear the case and to submit its 
recommendation to this Office within 20 working days upon submission of 
the dispute for resolution. </p>
  <p> "SO ORDERED."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner now comes before Us assailing the validity and reasonableness
 of the said May 20, 1983 order, and claiming that it will cause serious
 and irreparable damage to the strikers should they return to work 
considering that the issues thus raised in the strike remained 
unresolved.
</p><p>
However, on June 15, 1983, both union and company executed a Memorandum of Agreement which is quoted hereunder:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN <br>
    OCEANIC PHARMACAL, INC. AND
      <br>

previous to the work stoppage.
    </p>
    <p>
        2)   The Company agrees to withdraw or set aside the letters of 
dismissal sent to OPI employees on May 26, 1983, provided the employees

    <p>
        3)   A financial assistance (vale) in the amount of P750.00

on installments.
    </p>
    <p>
        4)   The Company shall continue to implement Article 10, Section 1 of the CBA (bank loans).
    </p>
    <p>
        5)   The issue of Medical Plan shall be submitted to further conciliation.
    </p>
    <p>
        6)   The Union shall immediately lift its picket upon the signing of this Agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
        7)   The Union hereby withdraws all Notices of Strike pending in
 the Ministry of Labor and Employment subject to the conciliation of the
 issue of Medical Plan (paragraph 5 hereof).
    </p>
    <p>
        8)   The parties hereby agree to withdraw all complaints filed 
vis-a-vis the other and their respective officers and members that arose
