ACCUSED ON THE GROUND OF THE ABSOLUTORY CAUSE OF INSTIGATION.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General summarized the People's version thus:</p>

<blockquote>"At about noon of December 20, 1987, in Baguio City, Maj.
Antonio Nañas, of the PC Narcotics Command of Region I, received information
from a civilian informer that a certain George was involved in the illegal sale
of marijuana.  Forthwith, Maj. Nañas
organized a team with him as leader and Sgts. Oscar Parajas and Godofredo Fider
as members, to conduct a "buy-bust" operation and effect the arrest
of the suspect.  Sgt. Parajas was
designated to act as poseur-buyer and was handed three (3) one hundred peso bills
to be used as purchase money (tsn., August 18, 1988, pp. 3-6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sgt. Parajas and the civilian informer then rode on the former's
motorcycle and proceeded to the Oro Theater along Magsaysay Avenue.  Maj. Nañas and Sgt. Fider followed them not
too far behind in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a car</span>.  At the Oro Theather, the civilian informer
led Sgt. Parajas to appellant George Agustin and introduced him (Sgt. Parajas)
as an interested buyer of marijuana.  Sgt. Parajas then conveyed his desire to buy P300.00 worth of marijuana
and handed appellant the three (3) hundred peso bills (tsn., June 29, 1988, pp.
4-5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accepting the amount, appellant led Sgt. Parajas on board the
latter's motorcycle towards San Carlos Heights.  Maj. Nañas and Sgt. Fider inconspicuously followed them from
behind.   When Sgt. Parajas and appellant
reached the junction of Naguilian Road and San Carlos Heights, appellant made
Sgt. Parajas wait while he went up San Carlos Heights to get the marijuana
(tsn., June 29, 1988, pp. 5-6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>After sometime, appellant came back bringing a pink plastic
bag.  Sgt. Parajas examined the bag and
finding that it contained marijuana, rolled up the sleeves of his jacket, the
pre-­arranged signal that the sale has been consummated.  Whereupon, Sgt. Fider rushed in and
introducing himself as a Narcom operative, arrested appellant (tsn., June 29,
1988, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pp. 6</span>-8; tsn., November
10, 1988, p. 11).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sgt. Fider frisked appellant and found inside the latter's pocket
one (1) one hundred peso bill, which was one of the three (3) one hundred peso
bills that Sgt. Parajas gave appellant as purchase money.   Sgt. Fider also found marijuana wrapped in an
old newspaper (tsn., November 10, 1988, pp. 12-­14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant was then brought to the office of the PC Narcotics
Command at the Agrix Building, Bokawkan Road, where he was investigated (tsn.,
August 18, 1988, p. 11).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, the seized marijuana were sent to the PC Crime
Laboratory at Camp Dangwa for examination (tsn., November 10, 1988, p.
17).  Marietta Bien, a forensic chemist,
subjected the seized items to microscopic and chromatographic examination and
found them to be positive for marijuana (tsn., August 18, 1988, pp.
18-20)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the accused claimed that he was a victim of
a frame-up.  He testified that at around
8:30 in the morning of December 20, 1987, he was fixing a window in their house
located at No. 282 Magsaysay Avenue, Baguio City when a stranger who introduced
himself as Jun came looking for his neighbor, a certain Fred.  Not finding Fred, Jun invited him and Rudy
Salazar, another neighbor, to drink the Andy Player that Jun was carrying.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
When the bottle of Andy Player was about to be consumed, two friends and
co-employees of Jun arrived.  Jun
requested them to buy some more drinks.  These two newly arrived persons agreed and bought a case of Beer Grande
and the group continued drinking.  While
the group was conversing, Jun asked him (the accused) if he knew somebody
selling marijuana and he answered in the negative.  This conversation was heard by his father who scolded him not to
deal with such drugs because people dealing with the same are arrested.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
After sometime, Jun left the group and returned at about noon riding on a
motorcycle and rejoined the group in its drinking bout.  Jun again asked him where they can get
marijuana and the latter answered that he really does not know anything about
marijuana.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After consuming the drinks that have been bought, Jun requested
the accused to accompany him in collecting from his (Jun's) debtors, to which
he agreed.  Before leaving, Jun handed
to him a P100-bill with which to buy some more drinks upon their return.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He and Jun then rode the latter's motorcycle and proceeded to Irisan where at a
corner store Jun left him to watch over the motorcycle.  After thirty (30) minutes, Jun came back and
ordered some more drinks at the corner store.  They then proceeded to Baguio City but were stopped at a checkpoint
along Naguilian Road manned by PC soldiers.  One of the soldiers, whom he came to know later as Sgt. Parajas, ordered
that he and Jun be frisked.  A companion
of Sgt. Parajas frisked him and recovered from him the P100-bill previously
given by Jun.  Jun then handed the key
of the motorcycle to Sgt. Parajas who unlocked the back compartment thereof and
found a plastic bag containing marijuana.  Upon questioning by Sgt. Parajas, Jun pointed to him as the owner of the
plastic bag of marijuana.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> Sgt.
Parajas then left on board the motorcycle of Jun.  After a while, he came back with several companions in a
car.  The accused was ordered to board
the car and was brought to the NARCOM office at the Agrix Building where he was
investigated by Sgt. Fider.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused pleads instigation as a defense.  He contends that the operation conducted by
the NARCOM agents was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>'buy-bust'
or entrapment operation whereby there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
</span>simultaneous giving of the marked money by the poseur-buyer and handing
over of the dangerous drugs by the 'pusher' or seller.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence he should be absolved from criminal liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">distinction </span>between
entrapment and instigation was explained by this Court in the case of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">People v. Gatong-o</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Entrapment is the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">employment
of such ways and means for the purpose of trapping or capturing a
lawbreaker.  Oftentimes it is the only
effective way of apprehending a criminal in the act of the commission of the
offense.  x x x A criminal is caught
committing the act by ways and means devised by peace officers.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">It must be distinguished

not have been committed were it not for the instigation by the peace
officer."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, upon being informed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>civilian informant that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>certain George was involved in the
illegal sale of marijuana, a team was organized by Major <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Nañas </span>to conduct a buy-bust operation
with Sgt. Parajas as poseur?buyer.  Upon reaching the Oro Theater the civilian informant introduced Sgt.
Parajas to the accused.  Sgt. Parajas
offered to buy P300.00 worth of marijuana.  The accused accepted the P300.00 and told Sgt. Parajas that they proceed
to San Carlos Heights were he will get the marijuana.  Upon reaching the junction of Naguilian Road and San Carlos
Heights, the accused told Sgt. Parajas to wait.  After one and a half hours, the accused came back with a plastic
bag of marijuana.  At this point, Sgt.
Parajas gave the pre-arranged signal for Sgt. Fider to move in.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence on record, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is </span>apparent that Sgt. Parajas did not perform any act which in
any way induced or influenced the accused to sell marijuana.  The accused has been involved in the selling
of marijuana and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sgt. Parajas </span>only
posed as a buyer.  The idea to commit
the crime did not originate from the NARCOM Agents who merely employed ways of
trapping or catching the accused <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">flagrante </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">delicto</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">.  </span>Thus, the buy-bust
operation was not tainted with infirmity which would absolve the accused from
criminal liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither does the claim of the accused that since there was no
simultaneous giving <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>the
marked money by the poseur-buyer and the handing over of the dangerous drugs by
the pusher or seller, the operation cannot be said to be a buy-bust or
entrapment operation.  We do not agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no rule which requires the simultaneous exchange of the
marked money and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dangerous </span>drug
between the poseur-buyer and the pusher or seller.  What <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>important <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>that the poseur-buyer received the
marijuana from the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Records show that the accused knew where to get the supply of marijuana.  The accused needed no prodding or
instigation to commit the crime for which he was charged.  It has been held that the mere act of
selling or even acting as broker in the sale of marijuana and other prohibited
drug consummates the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the accused contends that the marijuana and P100-bill
recovered by the NARCOM Agents were 'planted' evidence.   I<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">n </span>other
words, he was framed by the NARCOM agents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of frame-up can undoubtedly be fabricated with
facility.  It must, therefore, be proved
by clear and convincing evidence.  Like
an alibi, it is a weak defense that is easy to concoct and is difficult to
prove.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Records show that the accused and the NARCOM agents are strangers
to each other.  There is no reason for
the NARCOM agents to induce the accused to violate the law.  There is nothing in the records which could
explain why the prosecution witnesses would fabricate their testimonies and
implicate the accused in such a serious crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the NARCOM agents are law enforcers who are presumed to have
performed their duty regularly.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that the imposition of
subsidiary imprisonment in case of failure to pay the fine is erroneous.  Under Article 39(3) of the Revised Penal
Code, when the principal penalty imposed is higher <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
