</span>The police officers found the body of the victim lying face up at the

<p class="BODY">On the same day, Judge Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Manantan</span>,
finding that the crime charged has been committed and that the two accused are
probably guilty thereof, <span style="">directed </span>the
issuance of a warrant of arrest for the apprehension of said accused, fixing a
bond of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) for the temporary release of the
accused (p. 8, CFI rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The warrant of
arrest that was actually issued fixed the bail at Forty Thousand Pesos (P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) each (p. 9, CFI rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thinking that the bail fixed was still P30,000.00 for each of
them, accused thru counsel, petitioned the municipal court on January 21, 1970
for the reduction of aforesaid amount to P20,000.00 (p. 10, CFI rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated January 23, 1970, the said court denied the
petition for reduction of bail bond and affirmed that the original bail is
P40,000.00 each and that the said amount had already been reduced to P30,000.00
(p. 12, CFI rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 3, 1970, accused <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span>,
thru counsel <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>,

or <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> be
authorized to determine the solvency of the bondsmen and receive the bail since
"after effort has been exerted by his family, bondsmen could only be found
at <span class="SpellE">Binalonan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>," and "in order to avoid unneces­sary

<p class="BODY">In his order of <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1970</st1:date>, the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Villasis</span>
authorized the municipal judge of <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span> to
determine the solvency of the bondsmen and accept the bail bond of accused <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span> subject to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1970</st1:date>,
both accused posted their respective bails for P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>

waived their rights to the second stage of preliminary investigation (p. 75,

<p class="BODY">Asst. Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Proculo</span> <span class="SpellE">Viernes</span> filed the information for murder dated May 28, 1970
on June 3, 1970 before Branch V of the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span>
Court of First Instance (pp. 77 &amp; 78, CFI rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on <st1:date year="1970" day="24" month="6">June
 24, 1970</st1:date>, both accused entered a plea of not guilty (p. 94, CFI

<p class="BODY">For the prosecution, this case was handled by Asst. Provincial
Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Proculo</span> <span class="SpellE">Viernes</span>
assisted by Atty. Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Bince</span>, Jr. as private
prosecutor; and for the defense, Atty. Antonio Belen pursued the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court heard the case on July 9, August 10, August 13,
and August 26, all in 1970.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented these witnesses:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Filo­mena</span> S.

<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and resident of said muni­cipality; Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Caliboso</span>, 40, married,

resident of Barrio <span class="SpellE">Carosucan</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; and <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Torralba</span>, 58, married, barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Carosucan</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and residing in
said barrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As rebuttal witnesses, the
prosecution presented <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz, 43, married, Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> and a
resident therein; and Chief of Police Rafael <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Villasis</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The witnesses for the defense were Samuel <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span>,
25 years old, brother of accused <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span>, farmer and
resident of <span class="SpellE">Carosucan</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>; <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span>, 36, accused,

of the Forensic Chemistry Division of the <span class="SpellE">NBI</span> and
resident of 1242 <span class="SpellE">Makata</span>, Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on August 31, 1970, the lower court handed down its
decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, the
Court finds and so holds the accused <span class="SpellE">Ave­lino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> y <span class="SpellE">Sapigao</span> and Andres <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span>, alias <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, guilty
beyond reasonable doubt, as co-principals, of the crime of Murder, as charged,
and there being present the generic aggravating circumstances of evident
premeditation, nighttime and abuse of superior strength, with­out any
mitigating circumstance to offset any one or all of them, here­by sentences
them to die in the elec­tric chair, to indemnify the heirs of the victim <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Orines</span> the sum of
P12,000.00 and the further sums of P10,000.00 as moral damages, P10,000.00 <span style="">as </span>exemplary
damages, P500.00 as actual damages, and to pay the costs" (pp. 177 and
178, CFI rec.; pp. 46-47, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants now allege that the trial court erred in
giving credence to the testi­monies of <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Orines</span>, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Orines</span>, Chief of Police Rafael <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Villasis</span>, Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Caliboso</span> and Police Chief <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; in
discrediting barrio captain <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Torralba</span>; in resolving against <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> the negative result of his paraffin test; in
generalizing that flight, for want of bail, indicates a guilty conscience; in
unwarrantedly determining credibility exclusively on the basis of demeanor and
appearance of witnesses; in considering the evidence for the defense too
lightly and in belittling their defense of alibi; in finding the accused guilty
beyond reason­able doubt; and, in denying the accused a new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds the entire case wholly and solely dependent on
the credibility of the testimony of the victim's widow, <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orines</span>, the lone principal witness for the
prosecution, who was presented <span style="">as an
eyewitness </span>to the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
testimonies of all the other prosecution witnesses were presented <span style="">merely </span>to corroborate the testimony of
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">aforenamed</span></span><span style=""> widow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, </span>this Court does not intend to inquire or look into each of
the assignment of errors as <span style="">alleged </span>by
appellants but will review the lower court decision which is primarily based on
the widow's testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It now becomes
evident that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aniceta</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Orines</span>' </span>testimony
is decisive and crucial in the determination of the guilt of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let Us now consider <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span> <span class="SpellE">Orines</span>' version <span style="">of
the alleged </span>murder of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She stated that both accused are uncles of her slain husband <span style="">and they are </span>her neighbors in <span class="SpellE">Carusocan</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>; that on November 4, 1969, the accused <span style="">threatened to kill the victim when the latter
failed to bring out </span>a<span style=""> lost gun </span>which
the former wanted to get from him; that their house was fired at by the accused
on the night of November 6 and at noon of November 13, 1969, and these alleged
firings were not reported to the police; that at about 10:00 to 10:30 on the
night of November 16, 1969, they (she and <span style="">deceased) </span>were <span style="">loading </span>their belongings into a big truck owned by <span style="">a </span>certain Benito <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>
and parked in front of said owner's house facing the road; that they were bound
for <span class="SpellE">Diffun</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> that same night <span style="">because </span>of the threat hurled by the accused; that <span style="">while they were </span>loading the said
belongings into the cargo truck, she heard gunshots from the rear side of the
truck; that her husband was going up the big truck when he was shot and fell
with <span style="">his </span><span style="">face </span><span style="">upward; that she tried </span>to look at the
direction from where the gunshots came and saw the two accused-appellants; that
she was one and a half meters from the truck and one meter from the victim at
the time of the firing; that the place was lighted for there <span style="">was an </span>electric bulb from the nearby
house which reflected light and the truck was lighted; that <span style="">after </span>the shooting, she looked at her
husband who <span style="">lay face up </span>and was
already dead; that when she saw her husband was dead, she proceeded to the
house where her children were (pp. 65-73, Vol. I, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.
dated August 10, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon her cross-examination, however, <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span>
<span style="">declared </span>that at the time she
allegedly saw the <span style="">accused, </span><u><span style="">they were </span>holding
guns</u> and <u><span style="">they were actually
firing at him</span></u><span style=""> </span>and
that was the time she was hearing the shots (p. 77, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.
of August 10, 1970, Vol. I); that at the time the accused were firing at her
husband, they were near a big tree (p. 80, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
Aug. 10, 1970); that she was about one and a half meters from the truck at the
time of the firing (pp. 80-81, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 10,
1970); <u>that she did not become scared</u> when she heard the first shot; she
even looked at the direction where she heard the gunshot (p. 81, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 10, 1970); that she did not run towards the <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> house at the time of the incident (p. 81, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 10, 1970); and at the time she ran inside the
house, she only came out after everything was silent and peaceful (pp. 81-­82, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Aug. 10, 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">In her earlier statements before the Chief of <span style="">Police </span>(taken on November 16, 1969
when the events were still fresh in her mind), she positively declared thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q
-<span style=""> </span>What did you do when you heard those
shots fired?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A
-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked from the direction where the

which you knew the shots came from if any?</blockquote>

<u>holding their guns aimed to the direction where my husband was</u>.</blockquote>

-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw <u>by the light of <span class="GramE">a kerosene</span> lamp lighted which was placed on the ground and
by the light coming from a bulb which was lighted</u> while we were loading, as
we requested Mr. Benito <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> to put on the light
on the truck while we were loading, and further <u>there was moonlight already
at the time</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q
-<span style=""> </span>Is it not a fact that there were bushes
between the house of Mr. Benito <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> and another

high up to their head but they were in stooping posi­tion when they were firing

<p class="BODY">Of puzzling significance, too, is the fact that when <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span> testified during the trial, she never mentioned nor
did the fiscal bring out the presence of one Jesus Castillo at the time of the
shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her early statements before
the Chief of Police (actually taken on November 17, 1969) and those taken by
the municipal judge on November 24, 1969, she declared that Jesus Castillo was
assisting her husband in loading their belongings and that the former ran to
the house ahead of her when the shooting started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did the prosecution not present Jesus
Castillo who was another witness to the alleged murder?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony would have been vital and
crucial in con­firming the story of <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it be possible that if made to testify,
Castillo would have impugned or damaged the story which the prosecution tried
to build up?</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing manifestly reflects the uncertain and conflicting
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span>, the lone eye­witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her very own declarations reveal that what
really happened was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span>, her late husband, and a certain Jesus Castillo
were loading their belong­ings into the cargo truck, they were suddenly fired
at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The night was dark and there was no
moon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a kero­sene lamp and a
lighted bulb in the truck illuminated the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instinctively and impulsively, on hearing the
gunshots and sensing real danger, she ran towards the house, sought cover, <span class="GramE">then</span> came out when everything was already quiet.</p>

<p class="BODY">As she aptly stated, she tried to look in the direction from
where the firing came and since she was not certain of what she saw and
considering the in­adequate lighting, the distance of six to seven meters from
her and the presence of <span class="SpellE">santan</span> bushes, she came out
with different versions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could not
be consistent <span class="GramE">nor</span> certain with her narrations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon hearing the firing, her natural impulse
was to run to the nearest safe place which was <span class="SpellE">Florendo's</span>
house where her children were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
maternal instinct and her instinct for self-preserva­tion told her to run for
safety and be near her children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
then could she be definite as to what happened that night of the incident and
how then could she positively identify the culprits?</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, if, as she claimed, she was then barely one and one-half
meters from the truck and one meter from the victim, why was she not hit by any
of the thirteen shots fired by the alleged assailants?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was it sheer luck or simply because she
instantly ran away from the target area or she was not anywhere near the truck
or the victim?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only when the assault was
over did she come out of the house and found her husband dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another prosecution witness, Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span>,
testified that in between the rear of the truck where the body of <span class="SpellE">Orines</span> lay and six to seven meters away where the empty
shells were found, there stood a house and flowering bushes (p. 36, Vol. I, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. dated July 9, 1970).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From where <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span> stood, it was thus
unbelievable for her to have positively identified the accused considering the
pervading darkness, the distance of six to seven meters from where the alleged
assailants fired the shots and the fact that her view was obstructed by <span class="SpellE">Florendo's</span> house and the <span class="SpellE">santan</span>
bushes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise incredible was her
claim that she did not become scared upon hearing the gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being suddenly fired upon from a dark place,
an average person would immediately duck and run for cover.</p>

<p class="BODY">Initially, she alleged that there was moonlight on the night of
November 16, 1969 when the alleged killing occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in her later statements, she already
discarded the moonlight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the kero­sene
lamp and a bulb in the truck lighted the place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was corroborated by Chief of Police Rafael <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span>
when in answer to Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Viernes</span>' question, he cate­gorically
stated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<u>It was very dark</u>
but there was a kerosene lamp lighted" (p. 30, Vol. I, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.
dated July 9, 1970).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Caliboso</span> testified that when he arrived in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Piaz</span> to investigate the shooting, <u>it was still dark</u>
(p. 15, Vol. <span class="GramE">I, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 9,
1970; underscoring supplied).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Witness <span class="SpellE">Bascos</span> thus confirmed:</p>

<blockquote>"Q
-<span style=""> </span>In the place where these empty shells
were found, when you conducted the investigation, which is six to seven meters
away from the body, was dark, is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"A -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes,

<blockquote>"A
-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked her if she will give me her
statement that very night but she told me that because she was still upset she
requested me that she will give her statement the following day" (p. 37,
Vol. <span class="GramE">I, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 9, 1970).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Aniceta's</span> testimony <span style="">is </span>cluttered with con­tradictions and
so humanly unnatural and unrealistic that her credibility is heavily
damaged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">testimony
of the other prosecution witnesses are</span> not supportive of her version of
the story.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pampaluna</span>,
<span style="">et al. [</span>L-33805-9, March 31,
1980], where the only woman-eyewitness' testimony was also impugned, this Court
stated thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As <span style="">a </span>consequence
of <span class="GramE">Our</span> finding that <span class="SpellE">Besa's</span>
testimony does not deserve full faith and credit, appellants' defense of alibi
assumes importance since there <span style="">is </span>a
total absence of positive and clear proof that the appel­lants were the ones
responsible for the crimes charged in the information which gave rise to the
instant appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, <span class="GramE">We</span> have time and again stressed that alibi is the weakest of
all defenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is easy to con­coct,
difficult to prove (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, L-17599,
April 24, 1967, 19 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 769, 783, citing U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Olais</span>, 36 Phil. 828; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>,
51 Phil. 965; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, 76 Phil. 265, 272;
People vs. Bau­tista, L-17772, Oct. 31, 1962, 6 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
522, 529; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dayday</span>, L-20806 &amp; L-20807,
Aug. 14, 1965, 14 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 935, 942). Nonetheless, where,
as in the cases at bar, the evidence for the prosecution is inherently weak and
betrays lack of concreteness on the question of whether or not appellants are
the authors of the crimes charged, <u>alibi</u> as a defense becomes sig­nificant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy to reiterate here what
former Justice <span class="SpellE">J.B.L</span>. Reyes, speaking for this Court
in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fraga</span>, et al. (L-12005,
Aug. 31, 1960, 109 Phil. 241, 250) said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven was never intended to
change the burden of proof in criminal cases; otherwise, we <span style="">will </span>see the absurdity of an accused
being put in a more difficult position where the pro­secution's evidence is
vague and weak than where it is strong' (cited also in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bulawin</span>, 29 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 710, 722)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even as the prosecution tried to establish the motive for the
killing, this alone cannot replace proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The widow of the victim claims that the two defendants who are
uncles of the victim, threatened and attempted to kill him before the fatal
night because the victim failed to bring to them a lost gun they wanted.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has emphatically ruled that even when there exists an
apparent motivation for the murder -- that the accused was impelled to
instigate the crime as the victim was a brother of the then mayor, who
presumably reneged on his promise to give way in the 1971 election for the
position of mayor in favor of the accused -- there is still need for evidence,
both competent and credible, to prove his guilt and that of his co-accused
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>, L-35284, Jan. 17, 1975, 62 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 51).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
alleged failure of the victim to turn over a lost gun desired by the two <span class="GramE">appellants,</span> is not a sufficient motive for them to kill
their own nephew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unnatural for
two uncles to accord more value to a gun than the life of their nephew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that same <span class="SpellE">Roa</span>
case, this Court further said in reversing the judgment of conviction:</p>

<blockquote>"There is, in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dramayo</span>,
decided not too long ago, a restatement of what the constitutional presumption
of innocence signifies:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Accusation is
not, according to the funda­mental law, synonymous with guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is incumbent on the prosecu­tion to
demonstrate that culpability lies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants were not even called upon then to offer evidence on their
behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their freedom is forfeit only is
the requisite quantum of proof necessary for conviction be in exist­ence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their guilt must be shown beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To such a standard, this Court
has always been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
need, therefore, for the most careful scrutiny of the testimony of the state,
both oral and documentary, independently of whatever defense is offered by the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only if the judge below and
appellate tribunal could arrive at a conclusion that the crime had been
committed precisely by the person on trial under such an exacting test should
the sentence be one of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
thus required that every circumstance favoring his innocence be duly taken into
account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof against him must
survive the test of reason; the strongest suspicion must not be permitted to
sway judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conscience must be
satisfied that on the defendant could be laid the responsibility for the
offense charged; <u>that not only </u><u><span style="">did
he perpetrate the act but that it amounted to a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is required then is moral certainty</span></u><span style="">" (underscoring supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, again, in the
recent case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> (L-36020, Oct. 30,
1979, 93 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 772), this Court reiterated that
assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the accused had a very
strong motive to eliminate <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pascua</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
such motive cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable doubt, sufficient
to over­throw the presumption of innocence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proof beyond reasonable doubt is the mainstay of our accusatorial system
of criminal justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously
enunciated in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Basuel</span> (L-2815, Oct. 31,
1972, 42 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 207), only by proof beyond doubt which
requires moral certainty a "certainty that convinces and satisfies the
reason and conscience of those who are to act upon it" may the presumption
of innocence be overcome.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reasonable
doubt is meant "doubt engendered by an in­vestigation of the whole proof
and an inability after such investigation to let the mind rest easy upon the
certainty of guilt."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the instant case, the
evidence for the pro­secution indubitably and sadly falls short of that
requisite sufficiency and certainty which can persuade the human mind to agree
with the conclusion of guilt of the appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

threatened to liquidate <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> was
going up the rear of the truck, he was shot by <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> fell on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">He had a gunshot wound in the left arm and a fatal gunshot wound
in the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullet fractured his
ribs and lacerated his right lung.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Death
was due to profuse hemorrhage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The shooting was witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Anecita</span> <span class="SpellE">Orines</span> who was about one and a half meters from the
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were a lighted <span style="">kerosene </span>lamp in the rear of the truck
and an electric bulb on its side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was an electric light in <span class="SpellE">Florendo's</span> house.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Anecita</span> went home after gazing at her
husband who was sprawled on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> reported the killing to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen found empty cartridges near the
rear of the truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anecita</span>
told Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Caliboso</span> that she suspected <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span> as the
killers of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caliboso</span> informed the chief of police that the suspects
were <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Anecita</span> told the chief of police that
she saw <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span>
fleeing from the scene of the shooting and that the two had a serious misunderstanding
with her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">The chief of police filed a murder charge in the municipal court
against <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="3" month="6">June
 3, 1970</st1:date>, an assistant provincial fiscal filed <span class="GramE">an
information</span> for murder against the two suspects in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>
Branch V.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, Judge Vicente M. Santiago, Jr. in a decision dated
August 31, 1970 convicted <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span> of murder qualified by treachery and aggravated
by evident premeditation, <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and abuse of
superiority, sentenced the two to death and ordered them to pay an indemnity of
P32, 500 to the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Orines</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not believe <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo's</span>
alibi that at the time <span class="SpellE">Orines</span> was shot, he (<span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span>) was in the house of <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Carosucan</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> and the
alibi of <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span> that he was in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> from <st1:date year="1969" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1969</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The chief of police of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>
testified that he saw <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span> in <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span> on November 9, 11 and 15, 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> admitted that he had a little
misunderstanding with <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Orines</span>
because the latter allegedly proposed to him that they commit robbery but he (<span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span>) refused to join <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
in that nefarious enterprise.</p>

<p class="BODY">I agree with the trial court that the guilt of <span class="SpellE">Pisalvo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balatchica</span> was proven
beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in my opinion the imposable penalty is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Treachery absorbs <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and abuse of
superiority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evident premeditation
should not be considered aggravating because the time when the two culprits resolved
to kill <span class="SpellE">Orines</span> was not indubitably established.</p>
