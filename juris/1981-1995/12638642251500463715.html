<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In upholding the <span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>, the respondent court declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>We find that the plaintiff's evidence is sufficient to establish
his cause of action on the basis of the "<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>,"
the authenticity and due execution of which was admitted by defendants in their
answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said Agreement expressly
provided that the area leased to defendants was 1/2 hectare, and that the same
was to be returned or surrendered upon the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">expiration of the agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
lawyer who prepared, typed and notarized the document testified that the same
reflected the agreement of the parties, to whom he personally read the contents
of the deed (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. </span><st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Dec. 17, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant had made no pretense or allegation that he was misled by
plaintiff's misrepresentation into signing the "<span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>."
As a public instrument which enjoys the presumption of regularity, clear and
convincing evidence is necessary to contradict the terms thereof; and since
there is no allegations of any intrinsic ambiguity in the writing, nor of
mistake or imperfection thereof, <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence is
not admissible to vary the contents thereof (Rule 130, Sec. 7).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In rejecting the <span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">simulated agreement which the
defendants were deceived into signing, the trial court correctly declared that
fraud "cannot be presumed but must be established by clear and sufficient
evidence." Yet, disregarding the very rule he had stressed, the judge
readily accepted Ramon <span class="SpellE">Carenan's</span> unsupported and
self-serving testimony that the <span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span> did not
"express the true intent and agreement of the parties."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The trial court relied on
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Alday</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
de Jesus that the petitioners' houses had been constructed on the land earlier
than 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is hardly the convincing
evidence to prove that Ramon <span class="SpellE">Carenan</span> had been
deceived when </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">signed the <span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The connection is tenuous </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the conclusion far-fetched.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
the same time, and for no valid (or given) reason either, the judge ignored the
testimony of these same witnesses that the petitioners were merely hired
laborers and not tenants of the private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As for Ramon <span class="SpellE">Carenan</span> himself, the respondent court was correct in
disbelieving him when, while insisting that he was a tenant rather than a
hireling, he could nevertheless not remember what his share was in the proceeds
of the crop years 1969-70 and 1970-71.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Even if </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Grade III, as underscored </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the petition, it is not likely that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">farmer like him would forget such an important matter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">his share in the yield of the land he had worked and cultivated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A farmer does not need formal schooling to
remember this basic and important detail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If he was really a tenant, as he claims, he could not easily have
forgotten his participation in the fruits of his labors during the crop years
in question.</span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And going back to the <span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>, which
he signed despite his limited education, the Court notes that it was written in
<span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carenan's</span> native
tongue, and was actually read to him by witness <span class="SpellE">Alano</span>
before it was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">notarized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There could not have been any
misrepresentation by the private respondent as to its contents nor have the
petitioners themselves complained on this score.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, we find that the petitioners have not established by
convincing evidence that the <span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span> does not
reflect or express the true intent of the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
</span>they do <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not allege </span>any of
the other exceptions to the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule,
there is no justification for the Court to deviate from the said rule and to
hold that the parties are not bound by their agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The only other point to
consider is the following stipulation in the <span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span>
which the petitioners contend indicates that it was a tenancy agreement rather
than </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contract of services:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be denied that this paragraph, especially the last
phrase thereof, does suggest a tenancy sharing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the record does not show how such sharing was actually
effected, if at all, and, no less significantly, what the parties meant by the
existing law ("<span class="SpellE">batas</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>
<span class="SpellE">umiiral</span>"), which could refer to the tenancy law
or to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">agricultural minimum wage
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, and more importantly, the
petitioners cannot invoke the <span class="SpellE">Kasunduan</span> when it
serves their purpose and at the same time reject it when it operates against
their interests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a convenience
the Court will not permit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The same observation is
made of the private respondent's objection to <span class="SpellE">Carenan's</span>
testimony on the ground that it was neither subjected to cross-examination nor
formally offered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such objection is
inconsistent with his stand that that same testimony - especially <span class="SpellE">Carenan's</span> inability to remember his share in the yield of
the land - belies the petitioners' pretension that they are tenants </span>and
not hired help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that De
Jesus cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">invoke and challenge <span class="SpellE">Carenan's</span> testimony in the same breath; he must either
accept it entirely or reject it <u>in</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.</p>
