				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> to annul and set aside the order
of respondent Judge Manuel E. Valenzuela in Civil Case No. 8874-P of the Court
of First Ins足tance of Rizal, Branch XXIX, dated <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1981</st1:date>, ordering petitioner Buenaventura San
Juan to give support <u>pendente</u> <u>lite</u> to respondent Dorotea Mejia
and her minor children.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1981</st1:date>, the marriage between respondent Mejia and petitioner <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Juan</st1:place></st1:city>, solemnized on <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1973</st1:date>, was declared null and void by the Court
of First Instance of Rizal on the ground of a prior and subsisting marriage
between petitioner and one Isabel Bandin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1981</st1:date>,
respondent Mejia instituted the instant action against petitioner, docketed as
Civil Case No. 8874-P, seeking support for herself and her two minor children.</p>

<p class="BODY">After issues were joined, the respondent judge, on motion of
Mejia, entered the challenged order granting support <u>pendente</u> <u>lite</u>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, pursuant to Section 5, Rule 61 of
the New Rules of Court and after giving due regard to the necessities of the
plaintiff Dorotea Mejia and her children, Rachel San Juan and Jeffrey San Juan,
the application for support pendente lite is hereby granted, and the same is
fixed at P2,500.00 a month commen足cing from January 1, 1982 to be paid to the
plaintiff on or the 5th day of each month until this case is finally
adjudicated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is with足out prejudice
to any judgment for support in arrears due the plain足tiff if the evidence will
so warrant after trial."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Petitioner's motion for
reconsideration of the above order on the grounds that (1) the amount is
grossly disproportionate to petitioner's means; (2) petitioner is not obliged
to support respondent Mejia as their marriage is null and void; and (3) no
evidence was presented as to petitioner's present resources, was denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Hence, on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">March
 16, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, petitioner
instituted this petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">It appears that pending
resolution of this petition, petitioner filed with the trial court a
manifestation, dated June 17, 1982, proposing to settle his obligation of
P15,000.00, representing the amount of support which accrued from January to
June, 1982, and to pay the same in three equal installments, the first to be
paid upon approval by the court of his scheme of payment, and the balance within
a period of two (2) months thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This proposal was approved by the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the same manifestation, petitioner sought the reduction of the amount
of support <u>pendente</u> <u>lite</u> to P1,000.00 a month on the ground that
the sum of P2,500.00 previously fixed by respondent judge is now beyond his
means to pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to private
respondent, the court had not yet acted on petitioner's request for reduction
of the monthly support because the respondent judge left for abroad.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Unquestionably, the petitioner's willingness to pay the amount of
support <u>pendente</u> <u>lite</u> in the manner indicated in his
manifestation, and the approval thereof by the respondent judge have rendered
this petition moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the factual issue of whether the amount of P2,500.00
previously fixed by respondent judge is now beyond the means of petitioner, the
same should be resolved by the lower court on the basis of the evidence to be
presented at the proper hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
order of December 24 fixing the amount of support <u>pendente</u> <u>lite</u>
is not final in character in the sense that it can be the subject of
modification, depending on the changing conditions affecting the ability of the
obligor to pay the amount fixed for support.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is hereby dismissed for
being moot and academic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
