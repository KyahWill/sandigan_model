				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Two issues are involved in the instant special civil action of <i>mandamus</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first is whether or not the
appropriateness of a summary judgment may ever be so self-evident in a case as
to make it well nigh a duty on the part of the Trial Judge to grant the
plaintiff's motion <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second relates to the propriety of the
filing directly with this Court an application for a writ of <i>mandamus</i>
against a <i>municipal trial court</i>, considering that jurisdiction to issue
this extraordinary writ is also possessed by the Court of Appeals as well as
the Regional Trial Court of the district.</p>

alleged in essence that- </p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>he is the owner of a commercial building
consisting of three (3) sections, each of which is separately occupied by the
defendants (private respondents herein) as lessees;</blockquote>

were written, were all on "a month to month basis," and originally
prescribed a monthly rental of P350.00, later increased to P450.00; </blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>because the defendants all defaulted in the
payment of their rentals for many months, <span class="SpellE">Vergara's</span>
lawyer sent each of them a letter "(1) demanding payment of their unpaid
rentals, (2) terminating their lease contracts effective at the end of December
1985 on two grounds:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>non-payment of rentals
and plaintiff's need of the property for some other purpose, and (3) demanding
that defendants vacate the leased premises not later than the end of said month
of December 1985;"</blockquote>

a joint reply pertinently reading as follows:</blockquote>

the said premises as soon as you need it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However due to mainly economic reason, we request for an extension of
three months (3) to enable us to find new space wherein we can continue our sole
livelihood.";</p>

<blockquote>in addition, defendant <span class="SpellE">Montebon</span>
also paid a part of his arrearage;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>later however, the defendants wrote <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>another
letter; this time, while acknowledging the latter's ownership of the building
and their status as lessees thereof, they announced their refusal to vacate the
premises on the ground that the lot on which the building stands, though titled
in <span class="SpellE">Vergara's</span> name, was part of a tract of land
identified as Lot 508 which had been ordered reverted to the public domain by
the Regional Trial Court (Branch XIV) in a <span class="SpellE">decison</span>
rendered in Civil Case No. 16192 for "Cancellation of Titles and
Reversion" entitled "Republic of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Kwong</span> Tai Lung y <span class="SpellE">Cia</span>., et

<blockquote>6)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> wrote back
to them, pointing out the error of the position thus taken by them, and
reiterating his demand to vacate; his reply having gone unheeded, he initiated
the requisite proceedings before the Office of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain; and when the controversy was not settled by conciliation, he
instituted the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit at bar.</blockquote>

whatever judgment or orders might be rendered therein; that his title to the
land was not void nor had it ever been subject of any action for annulment; and

adverting to the distinction between a summary judgment under Rule 34 and a
judgment on the pleadings under Rule 19, and reiterating and amplifying the
propositions and arguments set out in his motion for summary judgment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The incidents were resolved by the respondent Judge in two

The Judge ruled that -</p>

<blockquote>" * * Ownership by the plaintiff of this building has not been
seriously denied by defendants who instead insist that their claim to ownership
of the land be a ground for a dismissal of this case for the court's lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the court believes
that this case properly is an Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span>
action as it assesses the respective claims of the parties and it (the court),
in accordance <span class="SpellE">witht</span> he provisions of Section 33 of
Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">BIg</span>. 129 is
not without authority to resolve the issue of ownership if only to determine
the issue of possession."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

motion for summary judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The denial
was grounded on the following observations of the respondent Judge:</p>

<blockquote>" * * Of course, the (plaintiff's) discussion seeks to
convince the court that there is no more need of a trial because conclusively
it is claimed that no genuine issue on a material fact was raised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it appears from the answer that the <b>material
allegations of facts in the complaint constituting plaintiff's cause of action
are specifically denied</b> and in addition thereto, defendants have put up <b>affirmative
defenses</b> in avoidance of plaintiff's claims. * *.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The rule gives the court limited authority to enter summary
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon a motion for summary
judgment, the court's sole function is to <b>determine whether there is an
issue of fact to be tried</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does
not vest the court with authority to try the issues on depositions, pleadings,
letters or affidavits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>** (I)f there is

upon its merits.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">His Honor's observations expose no little confusion about the
fundamental nature of a summary judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The confusion is further bared by his statement that <b>the "only
issue in this motion (for summary judgment) is whether, in this Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span> action the material averments of facts
constituting plaintiff's cause of action have been specifically denied in
accordance with Section 10, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court</b>." He seems to
think it is the same as a judgment on the pleadings which, of course, it is
not.</p>

<p class="BODY">The confusion is shared by the defendants (private respondents),
this being revealed by their argument that in view of their <b>denial</b> of
plaintiff's assertion of ownership over the premises in question, and their <span class="SpellE"><b>controversion</b></span> of "the material facts of the
adverse party," their answer did not only consist of a mere "general
denial" but "<b>definitely tendered a genuine issue</b>"
"which cannot be resolved by resort to mere summary judgment."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
Indeed, they point out that in their answer they have <b>dealt with each
paragraph of the complaint</b>; and "considering therefore the totality of
the allegations of ** (said) answer <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the
allegations of the complaint, ** the answer tendered a valid issue."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The essential question however is not whether the answer does
controvert the material allegations of the complaint but whether that <span class="SpellE"><b>controversion</b></span> <b>is</b> <b><i>bona</i></b> <b><i>fides</i></b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fundamental issue is not whether the
answer does tender valid issues -- as by setting forth specific denials and/or
affirmative defenses -- but whether <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>thus</b> <b>tendered</b>
<b>are</b> <b><i>genuine</i></b>, <b>or</b> <b>fictitious</b>, <b>sham,
characterized by bad faith</b>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court provides that where an
answer "fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits the material
allegation of the adverse party's pleading, the court may, on motion of that
party, direct <b>judgment on such pleading</b>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
The answer would fail to tender an issue, of course, if it does not comply with
the requirements for a specific denial set out in Section 10 (or Section 8) of
Rule 8; and it would admit the material allegations of the adverse party's
pleadings not only where it expressly confesses the truthfulness thereof but
also if it omits to deal with them at all.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, if an answer does in fact specifically deny the material
averments of the complaint in the manner indicated by said Section 10 of Rule
8, and/or asserts affirmative defenses (allegations of new matter which, while
admitting the material allegations of the complaint expressly or impliedly,
would nevertheless prevent or bar recovery by the plaintiff) in accordance with
Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 6, a judgment on the pleadings would naturally not be
proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if the answer does tender issues -- and therefore a
judgment on the pleadings is not proper -- a <b>summary judgment</b> may still

<p class="BODY">In this case, the defendants' answer appears on its face to
tender issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It purports to deal with
each of the material allegations of the complaint, and either specifically
denies, or professes lack of knowledge or information to form a belief as to
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also sets up affirmative

begin with, the defendants' denial of their own personal circumstances, as
these are stated in the complaint, is obviously sham.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accuracy of those stated circumstances is

plaintiff's building is located, and in which they have rented space and where
they have been maintaining their commercial establishments under one trade name
or another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As fictitious is their
denial of plaintiff's own personal circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They could not but know that those
circumstances had been correctly set down in the complaint, having been dealing
with the plaintiff for years, and he being the owner of the building occupied

</span></span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Their disavowal of the plaintiff's
ownership of the building occupied by them, and also that the building is
composed of three (3) sections, also cannot be genuine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had each been occupying those three (3)
sections for years and been paying rentals <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
to the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their answer contains
their admission that the plaintiff has title over the land on which the
building stands.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a>
There are two (2) written contracts showing the lease by two of them of the
building from the plaintiff, and a receipt evidencing payment by another of
rentals to the plaintiff, documents which they have made no serious or
effective effort to controvert but which, on the contrary, they have impliedly
admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, too, their own
letter to the plaintiff dated December 6, 1985, acknowledging receipt of the
communication of the latter's lawyer (demanding their vacation of the premises
and payment of rentals in arrears), and confirming their "verbal
commitment to you to leave the said premises as soon as you need it."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>

to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that they have
not denied writing or sending the letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What they say is that "they have no knowledge or information

a profession of ignorance about a fact which is patently and necessarily within
the pleader's knowledge, or means of knowing, as ineffectual, as no denial at
all.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

too, their denial of ever having paid rents to the plaintiff is
fictitious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts on record, to
which the plaintiff has drawn attention, inclusive of the official receipt

their affirmative defense, in which they assert title in themselves over the
land on which the plaintiff's building stands, is also sham, even an
absurdity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They base their claim on a
judgment rendered by the Regional Trial Court in an entirely separate action in
which title over a large tract of land -- of which the plaintiff's once formed
a part -- had been annulled, and the land ordered reverted to the public
domain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But neither the plaintiff nor
the defendants are parties to this action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The judgment has moreover been appealed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the defendants' connection with the case rests on nothing more
substantial than their <span class="SpellE">their</span> alleged membership in an
association at whose relation the reversion suit had supposedly been instituted
by the Republic, and which association would presumably have preferential
rights to occupy or acquire the land once finally reverted to the public
domain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is apparent that defendants'
claim of title to the particular lot of the plaintiff is so tenuous and
conjectural as to be practically inexistent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In any event, the claim is utterly irrelevant to the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit at bar, which involves merely the question of whether or not their
possession of the plaintiff's premises had become illegal in virtue of their
extended failure to pay rentals and their refusal to vacate the premises and
pay those arrears despite due demand.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">They are moreover <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
to dispute the plaintiff's title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"The tenant is not permitted to deny the title of his landlord at
the time of the commencement of the relation of landlord and tenant between
them."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances herein set forth at some length, the
fitness and propriety of a summary judgment cannot be disputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the respondent Judge to render
such a judgment was due solely to his unfortunate unfamiliarity with the
concept of a summary judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a
failure which we have it in our power to remedy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No genuine issue having been tendered by the
defendants, judgment should be directed as a matter of right in the plaintiff's
favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To yet require a trial
notwithstanding the pertinent allegations of the pleadings and the other facts
indubitably appearing on record would be a waste of time, and an injustice to
the plaintiff whose <span class="SpellE">obtention</span> of the relief to which
he is plainly and patently entitled would be further delayed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it is, the delay has already been
considerable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remedy properly available to the petitioner in the premises,
however, is not the writ of <i>mandamus</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Well known is the rule that <i>mandamus</i> issues only to compel
performance of a mandatory, ministerial duty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> The determination that under the
facts and circumstances obtaining in a case a summary judgment is proper, and
the motion <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> should be granted and summary
judgment consequently rendered, rests in the sound discretion of a trial court
and can not be regarded as a duty or ministerial function compellable by the
extraordinary writ of <i>mandamus</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, the respondent Judge had discretion to make that
determination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What happened was that
His Honor made that determination with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the plain and patent propriety of a
summary judgment, he declined to render such a verdict.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The writ of <i>certiorari</i> will lie to
correct that grave abuse of discretion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We turn now to the second question posed in the opening paragraph
of this opinion, as to the propriety of a direct resort to this Court for the
remedy of <i>mandamus</i> or other extraordinary writ against a municipal
court, instead of an attempt to initially obtain that relief from the Regional
Trial Court of the district or the Court of Appeals, both of which tribunals
share this Court's jurisdiction to issue the writ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of policy such a direct recourse
to this Court should not be allowed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Supreme Court is a court of last resort, and must so remain if it is to
satisfactorily perform the functions assigned to it by the fundamental charter
and immemorial tradition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot and
should not be burdened with the task of dealing with causes in the first
instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its original jurisdiction to
issue the so-called extraordinary writs should be exercised only where
absolutely necessary or where serious and important reasons exist <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
that jurisdiction should generally be exercised relative to actions or
proceedings before the Court of Appeals, or before constitutional or other
tribunals, bodies or agencies whose acts for some reason or another, are not
controllable by the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where the issuance of an extraordinary writ is also within the
competence of the Court of Appeals or a Regional Trial Court, it is in either
of these courts that the specific action for the writ's procurement must be
presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is and should continue
to be the policy in this regard, a policy that courts and lawyers must strictly
observe.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, however, to apply the policy by referring the
action to the Regional Trial Court of the district would serve no useful
purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would on the contrary work
injustice to the petitioner to whom the relief rightly due has already been
withheld for many years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case having
been filed before this Court as early as 1986, and having already been subject
of an extensive exchange of pleadings, it should and will now be decided
without further delay.</p>
