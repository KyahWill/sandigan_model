This is a petition for <em>certiorari </em>seeking to set aside the 
Order of the Deputy Minister of Labor and Employment, affirming the 
Order of the Regional Director, National Capital Region, in Case No. 
NCR-STF-5-2851-81, which dismissed the petitioners' complaint for 
alleged illegal dismissal and unpaid commission.
<p>
Petitioners were employed by the private respondent GENERAL TELEPHONE 
DIRECTORY COMPANY as sales representatives and charged with the duty of 
soliciting advertise­ments for inclusion in a telephone directory.
</p><p>
The records show that petitioners Iluminada Ver Buiser and Ma. Mercedes 
P. Intengan entered into an "Employment Contract (on Probationary 
Status)" on May 26, 1980 with private respondent, a corporation engaged 
in the business of publication and circulation of the directory of the 
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company.  Petitioner Ma. Cecilia 
Rillo-Acuña entered into the same employment contract on June 11, 1980 
with the private respondent.
</p><p>
Among others, the "Employment Contract (On Probationary Status)" included the following common provisions:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.  The company hereby employs the employee as telephone sales 
representative on a probationary status for a period of eighteen (18) 
months, i.e. from May 1980 to October 1981, inclusive.  It is understood
 that during the probationary period of employment, the Employee may be 
terminated at the pleasure of the company without the necessity of 
giving notice of termination or the payment of termination pay. </p>
  <p> "The Employee recognizes the fact that the nature of the telephone
 sales representative's job is such that the company would be able to 
determine his true character, conduct and selling capabilities only 
after the publication of the directory, and that it takes about eighteen
 (18) months before his worth as a telephone sales representative can be
 fully evaluated inasmuch as the advertisement solicited by him for a 
particular year are published in the directory only the following year."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Corollary to this, the private respondent prescribed sales quotas to be 
accomplished or met by the petitioners.  Failing to meet their 
respective sales quotas, the peti­tioners were dismissed from the 
service by the private respondent.  The records show that the private 
respondent terminated the services of petitioners Iluminada Ver Buiser 
and Cecilia Rillo-Acuña on May 14, 1981 and peti­tioner Ma. Mercedes P. 
Intengan on May 18, 1981 for their failure to meet their sales quotas.
</p><p>
Thus, on May 27, 1981, petitioners filed with the National Capital 
Region, Ministry of Labor and Employment, a complaint for illegal 
dismissal with claims for back-wages, earned commissions and other 
benefits, docketed as Case No. NCR-STF-5-2851-81.
</p><p>
The Regional Director of said ministry, in an Order dated September 21, 
1982, dismissed the complaints of the petitioners, except the claim for 
allowances which private respondent was ordered to pay.  A 
reconsideration of the Order was sought by the petitioners in a motion 
filed on September 30, 1982.  This motion, however, was treated as an 
appeal to the Minister of Labor.
</p><p>
On appeal, Deputy Minister Vicente Leogardo, Jr. of the Ministry of 
Labor issued an Order dated January 7, 1983, affirming the Regional 
Director's Order dated September 21, 1982, wherein it ruled that the 
petitioners have not attained permanent status since private respondent 
was justified in requiring a longer period of probation, and that the 
termination of petitioners' services was valid since the latter failed 
to meet their sales quotas.
</p><p>
Hence, this petition for <em>certiorari </em>on the alleged ground that 
public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack 
of jurisdiction.  Specifically, petitioners submit that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.   The Hon. Regional Director and the Hon. Deputy Minister 
committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in
 ruling that the probationary employment of petitioners herein is 
eighteen (18) months instead of the mandated six (6) months under the 
Labor Code, and in consequently further ruling that petitioners are not 
entitled to security of tenure while under said probation for 18 months.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.   The Hon. Regional Director and the Hon. Deputy Minister 
committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in
 ruling that petitioners were dismissed for a just and valid cause.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.   The Hon. Regional Director and the Hon. Deputy Minister 
committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in
 ruling that petitioners are not entitled to the commissions they have 
earned and accrued during their period of employment.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioners contend that under Articles 281-282 of the Labor Code, 
having served the respondent company continuously for over six (6) 
months, they have become automatically regular employees notwithstanding
 an agreement to the contrary.  Articles 281-282 read thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Art. 282.  Probationary Employment.  Probationary employment 
shall not exceed six (6) months from the date the employee started 
working, unless it is covered by an apprenticeship agreement stipulating
 a longer period.  The services of an employee who has been engaged on a
 probationary basis may be terminated for a just cause or when he fails 
to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards
 made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his 
engagement.  An employee who is allowed to work after a probationary 
period shall be considered a regular employee.  (As amended by PD 850)."
  </p>
  <p> "Art. 281.  Regular and Casual Employment.  - The provisions of 
written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the 
oral agreements of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be 
regular where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which 
are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the
 employer, except where the employment has been fixed for a specific 
project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been 
determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or where the 
work or services to be performed is seasonal in nature and the 
employment is for the duration of the season. </p>
  <p> An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by
 the preceding paragraph:  Provided, That, any employee who has rendered
 at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous or 
broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to the 
activity in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while
 such actually exists.  (As amended by PD 850)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is petitioners' submission that probationary employment cannot exceed
 six (6) months, the only ex­ception being apprenticeship and 
learnership agreements as provided in the Labor Code; that the Policy 
Instruction of the Minister of Labor and Employment nor any agreement of
 the parties could prevail over this mandatory requirement of the law; 
that this six months prescription of the Labor Code was mandated to give
 further efficacy to the constitutionally-guaranteed security of tenure 
of workers; and that the law does not allow any discretion on the part 
of the Minister of Labor and Employment to extend the probationary 
period for a longer period except in the aforecited instances.  Finally,
 petitioners maintain that since they are regular employees, they can 
only be removed or dismissed for any of the just and valid causes 
enumerated under Article 283 of the Labor Code.
</p><p>
We reject petitioners' contentions.  They have no basis in law.
</p><p>
Generally, the probationary period of employment is limited to six (6) 
months.  The exception to this general rule is when the parties to an 
employment contract may agree otherwise, such as when the same is 
established by company policy or when the same is required by the nature
 of work to be performed by the employee.  In the latter case, there is 
recognition of the exercise of managerial prerogatives in requiring a 
longer period of probationary employment, such as in the present case 
where the probationary period was set for eighteen (18) months, i.e. 
from May, 1980 to October, 1981 inclusive, especially where the employee
 must learn a particular kind of work such as selling, or when the job 
requires certain qualifications, skills, experience or training.
</p><p>
Policy Instruction No. 11 of the Minister of Labor and Employment has 
clarified any and all doubts on the period of probationary employment.  
It states as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Probationary Employment has been the subject of misunderstanding 
in some quarter.  Some people believe six (6) months is the probationary
 period in all cases.  On the other hand, employees who have already 
served the probationary period are some­times required to serve again on
 probation. </p>
  <p> Under the Labor Code, six (6) months is the general probationary 
period, but the probationary period is actually the period needed to 
determine fitness for the job.  This period, for lack of a better 
measure­ment is deemed to be the period needed to learn the job. </p>
  <p> The purpose of this policy is to protect the worker at the same 
time enable the employer to make a meaningful employee selection.  This 
purpose should be kept in mind in enforcing this provision of the Code. 
 This issuance shall take effect immediately."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case at bar, it is shown that private respondent Company needs at
 least eighteen (18) months to determine the character and selling 
capabilities of the petitioners as sales representatives.  The Company 
is engaged in advertisement and publication in the Yellow Pages of the 
PLDT Telephone Directories.  Publication of solicited ads are only made a
 year after the sale has been made and only then will the company be 
able to evaluate the efficiency, conduct, and selling ability of its 
sales representatives, the evaluation being based on the published ads. 
 Moreover, an eighteen-month probationary period is recognized by the 
Labor Union in the private respondent company, which is Article V of the
 Collective Bargaining Agreement, thus:
</p><p>
"Probationary Period - New employees hired for regular or permanent 
shall undergo a probationary or trial period of six (6) months, except 
in the cases of telephone or sales representatives where the 
probationary period shall be eighteen (18) months."
</p><p>
And as indicated earlier, the very contracts of employment signed and 
acquiesced to by the petitioners specifically indicate that "the company
 hereby employs the employee as telephone sales representative on a 
probationary status for a period of eighteen (18) months, i.e. from May 
1980 to October 1981, inclusive." This stipulation is not contrary to 
law, morals and public policy.
</p><p>
We, therefore, hold and rule that the probationary employment of 
petitioners set to eighteen (18) months is legal and valid and that the 
Regional Director and the Deputy Minister of Labor and Employment 
committed no abuse of discretion in ruling accordingly.
</p><p>
On the second assignment of error that public respondent committed grave
 abuse of discretion in ruling that petitioners were dismissed for a 
just and valid cause, this is not the first time that this issue has 
been raised before this Court.  Earlier, in the case of "Arthur Golez 
vs. The National Labor Relations Commission and General Telephone 
Directory Co.", G.R. No. L-64459, July 25, 1983, the petition for <em>certiorari </em>which raised the same issue against the herein private respondent was dismissed by this Court for lack of merit.
</p><p>
The practice of a company in laying off workers because they failed to 
make the work quota has been recognized in this jurisdiction.  
(Philippine American Embroideries vs. Embroidery and Garment Workers, 26
 SCRA 634, 639).  In the case at bar, the petitioners' failure to meet 
the sales quota assigned to each of them constitute a just cause of 
their dismissal, regardless of the permanent or probationary status of 
their employment.  Failure to observe prescribed standards of work, or 
to fulfill reasonable work assignments due to inefficiency may 
constitute just cause for dismissal.  Such inefficiency is understood to
 mean failure to attain work goals or work quotas, either by failing to 
complete the same within the allotted reasonable period, or by producing
 unsatisfactory results.  This management prerogative of requiring 
standards may be availed of so long as they are exercised in good faith 
for the advancement of the employer's interest.
</p><p>
Petitioners anchor their claim for commission pay on the Collective 
Agreement (CBA) of September 1981, in support of their third assignment 
of error.  Petitioners cannot avail of this agreement since their 
services had been terminated in May, 1981, at a time when the CBA of 
September, 1981 was not yet in existence.
</p><p>
In fine, there is nothing in the records to show any abuse or misuse of 
power properly vested in the respondent Deputy Minister of Labor and 
Employment.  For <em>certiorari </em>to lie, "there must be capricious, 
arbitrary and whimsical exercise of power, the very antithesis of the 
judicial prerogative in accordance with centuries of both civil and 
common law traditions." (Panaligan vs. Adolfo, 67 SCRA 176, 180).  The 
"abuse of discretion must be grave and patent, and it must be shown that
 the discretion was exercised arbitrarily or despotically." (Palma and 
Ignacio vs. Q. &amp; S., Inc., et al., 17 SCRA 97, 100; Philippine 
Virginia Tobacco Administration vs. Lucero, 125 SCRA 337, 343).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.

<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Abad Santos, Escolin,</em> and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
