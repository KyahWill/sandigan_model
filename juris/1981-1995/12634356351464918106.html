for a foreign land to work as a domestic.  Before her spread the promise of a new life, with all the enticements of
a future bright with the prospect of prosperity and even happiness.  But all this fled in a cruel twinkling.  Hardly two weeks after she left, she was
back in this country, broken of body and mind and with nothing but bitter
memories of her misadventure.</p>

<blockquote>The patient has no history of previous psychiatric
confinement.  She was apparently doing
well before she left for Saudi Arabia in July, 1987 to work as a domestic help
on a 2 year-contract.  She came home
unexpectedly last August 14, 1987 accompanied by MIA Security guards.  She was talking incoherently but repeatedly
verbalized that she was raped and harassed by her boss.  She also refused to eat and had to be
spooned.  These, together with the other
presenting problems promoted the family to bring the patient for consultation
on August 15, 1987.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">When </span>first seen at
the Out-Patient Service, she was fairly kempt, restless but manageable.  She was irrelevant with her responses but
claimed that she was a contract worker and she was raped.  No details were given.  Affect was expansive.  No <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">meaningful
</span>interview was established during the first visit.  She was given Inapsine Injection, Thorazine,
100 mg. BID and all impression of Brief Reactive Psychoses was given.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On March 9, 1988, Sumatre's sister, Cynthia Sumatre, filed a
complaint against Sigma and SPM Services with the POEA for payment of unpaid
salaries of US$150/month for the unworked and entire duration of her 2-year
contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sigma denied that Sumatre had been illegally dismissed and
claimed that she did not pass her probationary period of employment; besides,
she was repatriated because she was suffering from schizophreniform
disorder.  The petitioner also
questioned the capacity to sue of the complainant's sister.  Furthermore, it alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">that as
there was no implied agency between SPM Services and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Sigma, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">it could
not be held solidarily liable with SPM for the unpaid salaries of the
complainant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The POEA ruled in favor of the complainant and ordered SPM
Services and Sigma to solidarily pay the complainant her salaries for 2 years
amounting to US$4,800.00 or its peso equivalent at the time of payment.  They were also required to pay 5% of the
total award as and by way of attorney's fees.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, this decision was affirmed by the NLRC.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It is now faulted for grave abuse of discretion in this special civil action
for <i><u>certiorari</u></i><u>.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue before the Court is whether or not Sumatre had
been illegally dismissed, in light of the petitioner's contention that the
private respondent was a mere probationary employee who was, on top of this
status, mentally unsound.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 281 of the Labor Code provides that the services of an
employee who has been engaged on a probationary basis may be terminated for a
just cause, or when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance
with reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the
time of his engagement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second ground is not an issue as<i> </i>Sumatre was
repatriated after only two weeks.  We
are concerned only with the legality of her dismissal, which it is claiming was
justified because of her behavior when she was in Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 284 of the Labor Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>An employer may terminate the services of an employee who has been
found to be suffering from any disease and whose continued employment is
prohibited by law or is prejudicial to his health as well as to the health of
his co-employees:  Provided, That he is
paid separation pay equivalent to at least one (1) month salary or to one-half
(1/2) month salary for every year of service, whichever is greater, a fraction
of at least six (6) months being considered as one (1) whole year.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This ground was created by the foreign employer in this
case.  The report of her mental
examination showed that she had "no history of previous psychiatric
confinement.  She was apparently doing
well before she left for Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, in July 1987."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Apparently, she became schizophrenic because of her maltreatment by her
employer.  The theory that the injuries
of the private respondent were self-inflicted as a result of her schizophrenia
has not been substantiated.  It is a
mere surmise that cannot overcome her positive declaration, as supported by
medical findings, that she was mauled and beaten up by her employer
abroad.  In termination cases, the
burden of proof is on the employer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> This
burden has not been discharged by Sigma.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2(e), Rule V, Book I of the Omnibus Rules implementing the
Labor Code requires a private employment agency to assume all responsibilities
for the implementation of the contract of employment of an overseas worker.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 10 (a) (2) of the same Rule provides that a private employment agency
can be sued jointly and severally with the principal or foreign-based employer
for any violation of the recruitment agreement or the contract <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">of
employment.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">This
provision is also substantially reiterated in Section 1(f) (3) of Rule II, Book
II of the POEA Rules and Regulations.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent having been illegally dismissed and not
paid the wages due her from the foreign employer, the liabilities arising as a
consequence thereof shall attach to Sigma.  Although Sumatre filed her application with and paid the placement fee
to Carandang.  Sumatre's papers were
processed by Sigma.  Sigma appears in
fact to have deployed Sumatre, if she did not also recruit her, and so is
solidarily liable with the foreign-based employer for Sumatre's claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of whether or not the private respondent was indeed
maltreated is a question of fact.  The
factual findings of administrative bodies are as a rule binding on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">this
Court, subject to certain established exceptions.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> The
findings of the NLRC and the POEA will not be reversed by this Court without a
showing that they fall under the exceptions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's contention that Cynthia Sumatre has no capacity
to sue is devoid of merit.  Cynthia
Sumatre filed the complaint in behalf of her sister Susan as a real party in
interest, conformably to Section 2 of Rule 3 of the Rules of Court.  The private respondent issued a special
power of attorney in favor of Cynthia Sumatre, not to mention the fact that
Susan Sumatre herself attended all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the hearings of the case.  It is also stressed that in labor cases,
simplification of procedure, without regard to technicalities and without
sacrificing the fundamental requisites of due process, is mandated to insure
the speedy administration of justice.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Back wages are granted for earnings a worker has lost due to his
illegal dismissal.  We have held that an
employer is obliged to pay an illegally dismissed employee the whole amount of
salaries plus all other benefits and bonuses and general increases to which the
latter would have been normally entitled had he not been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">dismissed.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> There is
no reason for not applying this rule in the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The plight of Susan Sumatre illustrates only too starkly the
perils many of our womenfolk have to hazard, and endure, at the hands of
foreign employers who find them easy and defenseless prey.  It is hoped that the time will come when
they will not have to seek their fortunes abroad in their quest for a better
life, finding prosperity and peace in their own land and in the bosom of their
family and friends.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of a clear
showing that the questioned resolution is tainted with grave abuse of
discretion.  Costs against the
