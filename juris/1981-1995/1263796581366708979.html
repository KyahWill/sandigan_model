Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> dismissing Special
Proceedings No. 340-V for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary

the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was certified
to this Court by the Court of Appeals as it involves only questions of law.</p>

and <span class="GramE">treasurer</span> of <span class="SpellE">Obando</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, respectively (I.S. No. 2389).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
through falsification of public document was also filed against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> (I.S. No.
2390).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After conducting an
investigation, the provincial fiscal issued a resolution dismissing the charges
against petitioners for lack of sufficient evidence to warrant criminal
prosecution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Private respondents then filed a petition for review and/or
appeal with the Secretary of Justice who in a 3rd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1966" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1966</st1:date>,
through the Chief State Prosecutor, requested the investigating fiscal to make
a thorough reinvestigation of the cases in view of an apparent inconsistency in
the resolution dismissing the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, said fiscal in his 4th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1966</st1:date>,
disclaimed any inconsistency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, he conducted several hearings on the requested
reinvestigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Prior to the hearing set for May 10, 1967, petitioners filed
with the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition with preliminary injunction to restrain the provincial fiscal
from proceeding with the reinvestigation of the charges lodged against
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding the petition sufficient in
form and substance, the respondent court issued on <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1967</st1:date>, a temporary restraining order enjoining the
provincial fiscal from continuing with the reinvestigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After trial respondent court on <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1968</st1:date>, issued an order dismissing the petition

<blockquote>Upon consideration of the foregoing assignment of errors and the
issues as stated in their brief, we believe that petitioners-appellants raise
no factual issues but only questions of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the dismissal of their petition on the ground of failure to
include the Secretary of Justice as a necessary and indispensable party in this
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">suit </span>poses a legal issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly legal in nature is the question of

latter has made a finding that there is insufficiency of evidence to warrant
criminal prosecution.</blockquote>

</span>He may or may not file the complaint or information, follow or not
follow that presented by the offended party, according to whether the evidence,
in his opinion, is sufficient or not to establish the guilt of the accused
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason for
placing the criminal prosecution under the direction and control of the fiscal
is to prevent malicious or unfounded prosecution by private persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be controlled by the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prosecuting officers under the power vested
in them by law, not only have the authority but also the duty of prosecuting

fiscal determines the existence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of a </span><u>prima</u>

prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">It is </span>not prudent or even permissible for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>Court to compel the fiscal to
prosecute a proceeding originally initiated by him on <span class="GramE">an
information</span>, if he finds that the evidence relied upon by him is
insufficient for con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">viction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither has the Court any </span>power <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to order the fiscal to prosecute or file <span class="GramE">an information</span> within a certain period of time, since this
would interfere with the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> discretion and
control of criminal prosecutions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
a fiscal who asks for the dismissal of the case for insufficiency of evidence
has authority to do so, and Courts that grant the same </span>commit no
error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

preliminary or final nor a writ of prohibition may be issued by the Courts to
restrain a criminal prosecution except in the extreme case where it is
