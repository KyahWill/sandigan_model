<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not the questioned loan

<span class="SpellE">Martos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Berlina</span> Rodeo <span class="SpellE">Martos</span> and Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Martos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The documents at issue are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) PNB Application for Loan (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-PNB); (2)
Real Estate Mortgage Contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2-PNB); (3)
Promissory Note (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3-PNB); and (4) Supplement to
Real Estate Mortgage Contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4-PNB).</p>

<p class="BODY">The decisions of both the trial court and the respondent Court of
Appeals are generally based on the conclusion that the above-enumerated
documents were never executed by private respondents <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Berlina</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>
or if they were executed by them it was due to the misrepresentation and
trickery of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span> Tan.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the questioned documents, dated <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1968</st1:date> bear the signature of <span class="SpellE">Berlina</span>
Rodeo and the <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> of <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Martos</span> and Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Martos</span>,
private respondents herein as loan applicants, <span class="SpellE">promissors</span>
and mortgagors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent appellate court laid stress on the fact that <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are indeed </span>illiterate,
so that pitted against the bank with branches nationwide and a municipal
vice-mayor, they deserve the protection mandated by Art. 24 of the Civil Code
that the trial court should be vigilant for the protection of the plaintiffs
who are the parties at a disadvantage in the present case (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 58).</p>

<p class="BODY">It was noted however that both courts have overlooked or failed
to appreciate certain facts or circumstances that would have altered the
results of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Berlina</span> Rodeo admitted having signed
all four documents, because she was made to understand by <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span>
Tan that the documents were in connection with the mortgage instrument she
signed the previous day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her pretenses however that she signed the documents by mistake
are not persuasive and must be rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She can read and write having reached the third grade (TSN, Hearing of
Nov. 24, 1976, p. 17).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is improbable
that she missed reading the heading of the document, PHILIPPINE NATIONAL BANK,
printed in bold and big letters and immediately below it also printed in bold
letters, the title of the document "Application for Loan”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, she was the one identified by <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> Cabral, the Assistant Agent of the PNB, <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span> Agency, as the one who submitted to him the loan
papers and the one who guided him when<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>he inspected the property mortgaged (TSN,
Hearing of February 24, 1977, pp. 5-6) and the one he advised after conducting
the inspection and appraisal of the property, to go to <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>
to register the mortgage of the property in favor of the PNB (TSN, Hearing of
February 24, 1977, p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage
was in fact registered with the title of the property annotated (TSN, February
24, 1977, p. 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Martos</span> did not deny having made
her <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> over her typewritten name in the four
documents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Martos</span> denied having affixed his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
in the four documents (TSN, Hearing November 24, 1976, p. 33), which was
corroborated by the aforesaid testimony of <span class="SpellE">Berlina</span>
Rodeo (TSN, Hearing of November 24, 1976, pp. 10-11).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sub-agent of petitioner PNB at San
Agustin, <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Solocano</span> <span class="SpellE">Faigao</span>, identified the <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span>
over the typewritten name of <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> in the four
documents as belonging to <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Martos</span> himself which were affixed in his presence in his
office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This includes the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> over the name of <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Martos</span> appearing with the <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span>
name of Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Martos</span> below the notation at the back
of the promissory note requesting the PNB Assistant Agent, <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>, to deliver the proceeds of the loan to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Berlina</span> Rodeo <span class="SpellE">Martos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents signed or <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> the application <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">for </span>loan, the real estate mortgage contract, the promissory note
and the supplement to real estate mortgage before him in his office in the
municipal building where he holds office as Municipal Treasurer <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of </span>San Agustin, <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>
(TSN, Hearing of November 24, 1976, pp. 36-42).</p>

<p class="BODY">His testimony was corroborated and confirmed by the testimony of
Rodrigo Roy who is employed as land tax clerk in the Office of the Municipal
Treasurer of San Agustin, <span class="SpellE">Romblon</span>, stating that he
was the one who prepared the documents which were signed or <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span>
by private respondents herein in the Office of the Municipal Treasurer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He absolutely denied having any part in the
fraudulent transactions alluded to by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact he signed the instruments together
with <span class="SpellE">Faigao</span> as witness (TSN, Hearing of November 24,
1976, pp. 56-59).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These testimonies
belied the declarations of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Berlina</span>
Rodeo that she signed the documents at her house in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Salingsing</span>
where it was brought by <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span> Tan who also made
her affix her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> over the typewritten name of
her husband, <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Martos</span>,
in all the four documents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">counsel </span>for plaintiffs agreed at
the pre-trial conference that the name of Rodrigo Roy be stricken off from the
complaint which undoubtedly is an admission of <st1:city><st1:place>Roy</st1:place></st1:city>'s
non-involvement in any fraudulent act against private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the notary public who notarized the documents,
Lorenzo J. <span class="SpellE">Morada</span>, testified that all three private
respondents appeared in his office in connection with their application for a
loan with the PNB, which they personally presented to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">him </span>together with two other documents - a real estate mortgage
for P2,400 and supplement to real estate mortgage - for notarization.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the documents were already signed he
simply summoned all of them and asked them one by one whether the signatures
and <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> appearing on top of their names were
their true and genuine signatures and they answered in the affirmative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(TSN, </span>Hearing of November 24, 1976,
pp. 68-71).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the fact that <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Martos</span>, with his wife <span class="SpellE">Berlina</span>
Rodeo and Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Martos</span> did execute the application
for loan, the real estate mortgage securing the loan of P2,400.00, the
promissory note, and the supplement to real estate mortgage, has been
established by the testimonies not only by the government officials whose
presumption of regularity in the performance of duty has not been rebutted but
also by the notary public before whom the notarized instrument was verified
which is admissible as evidence without further proof of its due execution and
