				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This </span>is an appeal
by <i>certiorari</i> from the decision of the Court of Appeals dated December
16, 1969, setting aside as null and void the order dated August 23, 1968 of the
then Court of First Instance of Sorsogon and the order dated October 19, 1968
of the then Court of First Instance of Albay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that Mario Benito, Alfredo Benito and Benjamin
Benito were the registered co-owners pro-indiviso of a vast tract of land
covered by Transfer C<span style="">ertificate </span>of
Title No. 610 of the Register of Deeds of Sorsogon, located at Cumadcad,
Castilla, Sorsogon.  On January 16, <span style="">1957, </span>Mario Benito died
intestate.  His estate <span style="">then became the subject matter of Special
Proceedings No. </span><span style="">506 </span><span style="">of the then Court of First Instance of Albay,
entitled </span><span style="">"In </span><span style="">the Matter of the Intestate Estate of Mario
A. Benito, Deceased.  Basilia Lahorra,
Petitioner.  Saturnina Benito,
Oppositor." In that proceedings, the decedent's wife, </span><span style="">Basilia </span><span style="">Lahorra Vda. de Benito and his father, Saturnino Benito, were appointed
on April 12, 1957 co-administrators of the estate of the deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 16, 1959,
Benjamin Benito, one of the </span>co-owners, sold his one-third (1/3)
undivided share to <span style="">petitioner </span>Luz
Caro.  On September 15, 1960, Luz Caro
filed <span style="">before the defunct Court of First
Instance of Sorsogon, acting as a land registration court, a petition to </span>subdivide
the land in controversy.  The affidavits
of the <span style="">late Alfredo Benito, co-owner of
the land in question, Saturnino Benito, co-administrator and principal heir of
Mario Benito, and Josefina Duran, the mortgagee of the </span>share of Alfredo
Benito, consenting to the subdivision, were attached to the petition.  On September 27, 1960, upon <span style="">ver</span>bal motion of Luz Caro and for
reasons known only to <span style="">her, t</span>h<span style="">e </span>consideration of the petition for
subdivision was <span style="">held in abeyance until
further notice from her.  Eight years
later, on July 5, 1968, petitioner Luz Caro filed an ex-parte motion to set the
case for hearing, and the trial </span>court, without notifying anybody,
proceeded on August 23, 1968, with the reception of petitioner's evidence
ex-parte.  On even date, the trial court
issued an order directing the issuance of a separate title to Luz Caro, but
holding in abeyance the issuance of certificates of title covering the shares
of Mario Benito and Alfredo Benito, for the reason that both were then deceased
and the court had not been informed as to who their legal heirs were.</p>

<p class="BODY">In consonance with the order of August 23, 1968, the Register of
Deeds of Sorsogon issued Transfer Certificate of Title No. 4978 to petitioner
Luz Caro, covering her one-third (1/3) segregated portion identified as Lot No.
1-C, Psu 75542, Amd-2, with an area of about 163-65-06 hectares.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the strength of her separate title, petitioner filed a motion
in the then Court of First Instance of Albay trying Special Proceedings No. 508
and obtained an order dated October 19, 1968 directing the administratrix
Basilia Lahorra Vda. de Benito (private respondent herein) to deliver to Luz
Caro the possession of Lot No. 1-C, as well as enjoining private respondent or
her representatives from gathering the produce thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent sought
a reconsideration of said order of October 19, 1968, but the same was denied by
the Court of First Instance of Albay.  Her second motion for reconsideration was also denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On August 16, 1969,
private respondent filed a </span>special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
with the Court of <span style="">Appeals, seeking the
annulment </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the order </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the Court </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">First Instance of Sorsogon dated August 23, 1968 and the </span>order
of the Court of First Instance of Albay dated October 19, 1968.  In its decision promulgated on December 16,
1969, the appellate court nullified both orders on the <span style="">ground that said courts acted without jurisdiction and with grave abuse
of discretion in issuing said orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 3, 1970,
petitioner interposed this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.  This Court denied the petition for lack of
merit in its minute resolution dated </span>January 8, 1970.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 17, 1970,
petitioner filed an amended petition accompanied with a motion for admission,
stating </span><span style="">among </span>others, that
material facts were inadvertently <span style="">omitted
in </span>the original petition.  This
Court admitted the <span style="">amended </span>petition,
but denied the same for lack of merit in its resolution dated January 21, 1970.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 4, 1970,
petitioner filed a motion for </span>leave to file a motion for reconsideration
of the resolution dated January 21, 1970, attaching thereto the <span style="">said motion for reconsideration with a prayer
that the </span>amended petition be given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 9, 1970, the
Court reconsidered its previous resolution and gave due course to the
petition.  On June 17, 1970, the Court
issued a writ of preliminary injunction restraining the enforcement of the
injunction issued by the Court of Appeals on August 16, 1969.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The two issues in this
petition are:  (1) whether or not the
Courts of First Instance of Sorsogon and Albay had the jurisdiction to issue
the orders subject matter of this petition; </span>and <span style="">(2) whether <i>certiorari</i> is the appropriate remedy to question the
validity of the aforestated orders </span><span style="">of
</span><span style="">the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the issue as to
whether or not the CFI of Sorsogon has the power and authority to issue the
order of August 23, 1968 directing the issuance of a separate title to Luz
Caro, we agree with the ruling of the respondent appellate court that said
order was issued without jurisdiction.  The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> did not acquire jurisdiction over the
petition </span><span style="">and/or </span>the land
sought to be subdivided for lack of notice to all the parties in interest, as
required under Section <span style="">112 of Act No.
496.  Notice as required by the
above-cited statute is jurisdictional and the lack of it deprives the </span>court
of the authority to make a valid decree.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners claim that </span>such
<span style="">notice </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">unnecessary since the
parties affected by the subdivision p</span>roce<span style="">edings </span>manifested their conformity thereto.  The r<span style="">egistered
</span>co-owner, Alfredo Benito, together with Josefina Duran, the mortgagee of
the share of Benjamin Benito, executed an affidavit of consent to the
subdivision.  Likewise, Saturnino
Benito, an heir who was also appointed co-administrator of the estate of M<span style="">ario </span>Benito, the other <span style="">registered co-owner, executed an affidavit of
c</span>onform<span style="">ity.</span>  <span style="">According
to petitioners, Saturnino Benito's affidavit is binding not only upon the
estate but also upon the administratrix, Basilia Lahorra Vda. de Benito.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We do not agree with the
petitioner.  The records do not show
that the required notice was given to all the parties in interest.  One of the ind</span>i<span style="">spensable parties, respondent Basilia Lahorra
Vda. de Benito who was the co-administratrix of the estate of the deceased
Mario Benito, was not given any notice, nor did she give her conformity to the
partition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the court to </span>vali<span style="">dly</span> <span style="">acquire jurisdiction to hear and determine the petition, the mode and
manner of service of notice is governed by Section 113 of Act No. 496, viz:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"All notices required by or given in pursuance of the
provisions of this Act by the clerk or any register of deeds, after original <span style="">registration, shall be sent by mail to the
person to be notified at his residence and post-office address as stated in the
certific</span>ate<span style=""> of title, or in any
registered instrument under which he claims an interest in the office of the
clerk or </span>r<span style="">egi</span>ster <span style="">of deeds, relating to the parcel of land in
question.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>All notices and citations directed by special order of the court
under the provisions of this Act, after original registration, may be served in
the manner above stated, and the certificate of the clerk shall be conclusive
of such service; Provided, however, That the court may in any case order
different or further service, by publication or otherwise, and shall in all
cases d<span style="">o so when the interests of </span><span style="">justic</span><span style="">e</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">require such section."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order of the CFI of Sorsogon being void is no <span style="">order at </span><span style="">all.  It confers no right nor
does it impose any duty.  "It
neither binds nor bars any one."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> All acts performed under a void order or
judgments and all claims flowing out of it are also void, for like the spring
that </span><span style="">cannot </span><span style="">rise above its source, a void order cannot
create a valid and legally enforceable right.  A fortiori the order of October 19, 1968 of the CFI of Albay directing
private respondent to deliver the possession and enjoyment of Lot No. 1-C to
Luz Caro, is also void.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the second issue as to
whether a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> is the proper remedy to
question the validity of the aforestated ord<span style="">er</span>s, we likewise agree </span><span style="">wit</span><span style="">h </span>respondent
appellate court.  An order or judgment
rendered by a <span style="">cou</span><span style="">rt</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">without jurisdiction is
without legal effect, </span>hence, <span style="">it
may be impugned at any time and in any </span>proceedings <span style="">by a party against whom it is </span><span style="">so</span><span style="">ught
to be </span>enforced.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's argument is
correct if the order or judgment in </span>q<span style="">uestion was issued with grave abuse of </span>discretion or in excess
of jurisdiction or if mere errors of judgment were committ<span style="">ed,</span> for in such cases the court at the
<span style="">outset has jurisdiction, but not in the
instant case where the court fro</span><span style="">m</span><span style=""> the very beginning has not acquired </span>the
power <span style="">and authority to hear and
determine the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As held in Crisostomo v. Endencia (66 Phil. 1, 8) "the
remedy by <i>certiorari</i> may be successfully invoked  both in cases wherein an appeal does not lie
and in those wherein the right to appeal having been lost with or without the
appellant's negligence, the court has no jurisdiction to issue the order or
decision which is the subject matter of the remedy."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE, </span></b>the
petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.  The preliminary injunction issued by the Court on <span style="">June 7, </span>1970 is hereby lifted.  Costs against petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">This decision is immediately executory.</p>
