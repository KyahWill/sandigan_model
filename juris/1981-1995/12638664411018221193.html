				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, with a prayer
for a restraining order, seeking the annulment of the December 6, 1983 decision
of the Board of Energy in BOE Case No. 82-684 approving the amount of P282<span class="GramE">,024,877.40</span> as the fair and reasonable value of the
properties, assets and equipment in service as of October 9, 1981 of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Light and Power Co., Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioners are residents of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
City and consumers of electricity of herein private respondent <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Light and Power Co., Inc. (DALIGHT, in short), the
authorized operator of electric light, heat and power service in the City <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, as well
as in the municipalities of </span><span class="SpellE">Panabo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="GramE">Tomas and Carmen, all in the
province of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del Norte.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, in their own behalf and on
behalf <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the more or less 70,000
consumers of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City and its environs, opposed the
inclusion by herein public respondent Board of Energy (BOE) of some properties
of DALIGHT for reappraisals because they will have a direct bearing on the
rates that respondent DALIGHT charges its customers to the effect that the
higher the appraisal of the properties, the higher will be the base of the 12%
allowable return; or otherwise stated, the higher the rates the consumers will
have to pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">As gathered from the records, the facts of this case are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1980</st1:date>,
respondent DALIGHT filed with public respondent BOE an application for the
approval of the sound value appraisal of its properties and equipment in
service as of <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1979</st1:date>
in the amount of P339<span class="GramE">,311,139.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appraisal was made by the Technical and
Management Service <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(Phil.), </span>Inc.
(TAMSPHIL).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent BOE, after
hearings, in an order dated <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="3">March 13,
 1981</st1:date>, constituted an inspection team to conduct ocular
inspection/verification of the physical existence and ownership of all the
properties and equipment of DALIGHT as listed the TAMSPHIL Appraisal
Report.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, respondent BOE, in
an order dated June 19, 1981, based on the submission of the inspection team,
disapproved TAMSPHIL appraisal because:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) TAMSPHIL was disqualified from making the appraisal, its
President-Chairman being then a technical and engineering consultant of
applicant DALIGHT; and (2) there were deficiencies and discrepancies in the
appraisal report of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">such </span>serious
proportion as to affect the over-all integrity and reliability of the said
report.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 24, 1982, DALIGHT again filed an application for the
approval of the appraisal of its properties and equipment in service as of
October 9, 1981 in the amount of P302,109,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 23-24).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This time, the appraisal was
conducted by Asian Appraisal Co., Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said application was opposed by the petitioners (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 27-33).</p>

<p class="BODY">BOE constituted a team to conduct ocular examination/verification
of <span class="SpellE">DALIGHT’s</span> properties and equipment, including its
books of accounts and other papers relative to the Appraisal Report of Asian
Appraisal Co., Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The inspection team
submitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">its </span>report on <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent BOE, in a decision dated <st1:date year="1983" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1983</st1:date>, approved the amount of P282<span class="GramE">,024,877.40</span> as the fair and reasonable value of <span class="SpellE">DALIGHT’s</span> properties, assets and equipment in the service
as of <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1981</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 86-97).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners received the
same on <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 19, 1984, or seventeen (17) days after receipt of the
said decision, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp. 98-112), but the
same was denied in an order dated June 25, 1984 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p. 128).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently not having received the said order of <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1984</st1:date>, petitioners in their motion of <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1984</st1:date> prayed that a
hearing be conducted and/or a resolution be issued on their motion for
reconsideration (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 125-126).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, respondent BOE issued an order dated <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1984</st1:date>, informing petitioners that the
motion had long been denied, furnishing <span class="GramE">them</span> copies of
the <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1984</st1:date> order (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 128).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1985</st1:date>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
filed its Petition in Intervention (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 219-223).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all the required pleadings were filed,
the First Division of this Court, in a resolution dated January 20, 1986,
resolved to give due course to the petition and the petition for intervention (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 354).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioners filed their memorandum, instead of a
brief, on <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1987</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 403-429); while respondent DALIGHT and public respondent BOE filed a
manifestation that they be allowed to adopt their respective comments <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as </span>their
respective briefs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised by petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Arial"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">1.<span style="font:7.0pt " times="" new="" roman""="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not <i>certiorari</i> is the proper
remedy in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not the properties included in the
appraisal should be excluded.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY">There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>no
question that <i>certiorari</i> is not the proper remedy in this case as PD No.
1206 creating BOE provides for an appeal to the Office of the President within
seven (7) days from receipt of notice of its decision or orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, under the Interim Rules
Implementing Sec. 9 of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, final
decisions, orders, awards or resolutions of all quasi-judicial bodies other
than those specifically excepted are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by
the Intermediate Appellate Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that after receipt of the questioned decision of
<st1:date year="1983" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1983</st1:date> on <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1983</st1:date>, petitioners filed
a motion for reconsideration thereof only on <st1:date year="1984" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1984</st1:date>, or seventeen <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">(</span>17) days from receipt of the said decision, which therefore had
already <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">become </span>final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
received a copy of the order of <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6">June
 25, 1984</st1:date> and of <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="10">October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">31, </span>1984</st1:date> informing them of
said denial on <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But while it is evident that there was error in the remedy
resorted to, this Court in the broader <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">interests
of</span> justice has in a number of cases given due course to a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
although the proper remedy is appeal especially where the equities warrant such
recourse and considering that dismissals on technicalities are viewed with
disapproval (<span class="SpellE">Marahay</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Melicon</span>
etc. et al., G.R. L-44980, Feb. 6, 1990 citing <span class="SpellE">Perlas</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, 3 Phil. 559 [1916]; Alfonso v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span> 80 Phil. 407 [1948]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it is well settled that litigations should, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>much as possible, be decided on
their merits and not on technicalities (<span class="SpellE">Galdo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>, 84 SCRA 239, 242-243 [1978]); that every
party-litigant must be afforded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just
determination of his case, free from unacceptable plea of technicalities (Heirs
of <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> Morales v. Court of Appeals, 67 SCRA 304,
310 [1975]); that this Court, in the exercise of equity jurisdiction, decided
to disregard technicalities in order to resolve the case on its merits based on
evidence (St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc., et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>,
121 SCRA 287 [1983]; <span class="SpellE">Helmuth</span>, Jr. v. <span class="GramE">People of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">, 112 SCRA 573 [1982]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">A careful review of the records show</span>
that this case will not only affect herein petitioners who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>some points have a good cause of
action but also the more or less <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">70,000
</span>consumers in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and its environs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it appears more appropriate to
consider the petition on its merits rather than to dismiss it on
technicalities.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">There appears to be no dispute on the generally accepted
principle that in order to comply with the legal mandate that electric
utilities must render safe, reliable and efficient service to the general
public which in the process would require tremendous expenditure of working
funds, a revaluation of assets to a more realistic level must be allowed to
enable said utilities to accumulate funds with which to replace their
obsolescent assets (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 96).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners take exceptions, however, to the fact that the
assailed decision approved appraisals consisting of: </p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(1) </span>Properties of respondent
DALIGHT which by legal mandate cannot be replaced anymore;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Properties which have no bearing on the production/distribution
of power to consumers;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) Properties that are not owned by DALIGHT;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(4) </span>Properties which
by their nature are not subject to appraisal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 11)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Verily, it is well settled that this Court cannot substitute its
judgment or discretion for that of the BOE whose decisions and determinations
particularly on matters of facts are entitled to great weight and respect.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it is equally accepted that exhaustion of administrative
remedies before resort to judicial bodies is not an absolute rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It admits of exception, among which <span class="GramE">is that</span> where the question litigated upon is a purely legal
one, the rule does not apply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Bagatsing</span> v. Ramirez 74 SCRA 307 [1976];
<span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ramento</span> 129
SCRA 359 [1984]; <span class="SpellE">Limorco</span> v. Board of Administrations,
PVAO, 133 SCRA 43 [1984]; National Housing Authority v. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">C.A.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">
121 SCRA 777 [1983]).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
likewise true that while administrative determination on questions of law is
persuasive on courts and carries with it a strong presumption of correctness,
nonetheless, the interpretation and application of laws is the courts’
prerogative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Cadwallader</span> et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Abedela</span>, 98
SCRA 123 [1980]; <span class="SpellE">Philex</span> Mining Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Zaldiva</span>, 43 SCRA 479 [1972]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Equally important is the fact that the rule may and should be
relaxed when its application may cause great and irreparable damage (<span class="SpellE">Bagatsing</span> v. Ramirez, <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier pointed out, the assailed decision may affect more or
less 70,000 consumers in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and its environs.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful scrutiny of the records shows that the bone of
contention in this case is not the factual determination of the appraisals of
the properties involved and the rates fixed by reason thereof, but the legal
determination of the properties covered by the reappraisal under laws pertinent
thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Under Presidential Decree No. 40 it is expressly provided that
the setting up of transmission lines grids and the construction of associated
generation facilities shall be the responsibility of the National Power
Corporation as the authorized implementing agency of the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner plant additions necessary
to meet the increase in power demand in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the
area </span>covered thereby shall be constructed and owned by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">NPC.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, there is no dispute that DALIGHT is no longer
allowed to replace its generators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the obligation to pay for four (4) generators was assumed by NPC and they
were just leased to DALIGHT.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the claim of DALIGHT that it was advised by
NPC to retain its generators as standby units, appears to be a mere temporary
measure when there was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">only </span>one
line connecting the <span class="SpellE">Agus</span> Grid in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>
City to <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City passing through dangerous rebel
infested territories, then in constant danger of sabotage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Presently, however, there are two more lines
passing safe areas which precluded the danger of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
from being cut off from the <span class="SpellE">Agno</span> Grid thru sabotage (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 75-77).</p>

<p class="BODY">As DALIGHT is precluded by PD No. 40 from replacing these assets
said generators with an approved sound value of P153<span class="GramE">,504,500.00</span>
should have been excluded from the appraisal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even granting that said generators are still being used and as
such subject to repairs and maintenance costs, still they are operating
expenses deductible from current income and have nothing to do with appraisals
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 413).</p>

<p class="BODY">2. <span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Properties objected to
as having no bearing to the production/distribution of power to consumers
are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the administration building appraised
at P3<span class="GramE">,383,110.00</span> and an airplane with a sound value of
P75,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was found among other things that aside from the fact that a
portion of the administration building is being rented to others, it had been
substantially torn apart leaving only the foundation and the main posts and
completely rebuilt with a very different design.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the new costs of construction
were added to the appraisal of the old building, thereby inflating the value of
the same beyond reasonable valuations (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
420).</p>

<p class="BODY">In like manner, the regular use of the airplane allegedly to
observe watersheds which cover vast stretches of forest <span class="GramE">was</span>
not established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead the BOE Special
Investigation Team found the airplane in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City
which has no connection to power generation and the only licensed pilot of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Light is its president who is not expected to conduct
dangerous <span class="SpellE">reconnaisance</span> flights himself (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 420-421).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, 40% of the valuation of the building which is
devoted to lease and not to the operation of electricity should be deducted
from the total valuation, that is, P3,383,110.00 - 1,353,244.00 (representing
40% of total valuation) = P2,029,866.00, the sound value appraisal of <span class="SpellE">DALIGHT’s</span> property including the construction cost in <span class="SpellE">remodelling</span> the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the appraised value of the airplane which is
not being used in the operation of electricity should be excluded in the
appraisal.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. Properties allegedly not owned by respondent DALIGHT are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) improvements constructed on the <span class="SpellE">Talomo</span> Hydro Power System which is leased from NPC and (b)
improvements constructed under the <span class="SpellE">Digos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Parrigan</span> Projects Agreement, all of which are permanent
improvements which cannot be removed even after the expiration of the lease
without violation of the lease agreement (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
422-423).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same manner, the sound value of these improvements should
have been excluded from the appraisal of <span class="SpellE">DALIGHT’s</span>
properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. Properties which allegedly by their nature are not subject to
appraisal are motor vehicles which fall under the “Employees Car Plan”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the employer retains the registration
of the same in its name, it is only a form of alien against said vehicle should
the employee <span class="GramE">opt</span> to abscond before the vehicle is
fully paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the vehicle has been
sold to the employees even though conditionally and for only one half of the
purchase price conclusively proves that the vehicles are no longer owned by the
employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still further, should the employment of the employees concerned
be terminated before all installments are fully paid, the vehicles will be
taken by the employer and all installments paid shall be considered rentals per
<span class="GramE">agreement.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
that eventuality, said vehicle will neither qualify for appraisal because the
same have been used to earn rentals and <span class="GramE">not for power
generation nor</span> distribution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resume, the amounts to be deducted from the approved amount of
P282<span class="GramE">,024,877.40</span> which is the appraised sound value of <span class="SpellE">DALIGHT’s</span> properties, assets and equipment, are as follows:</p>
