<blockquote>"The evidence of the prosecution shows that at about 8:00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in </span>the evening of February 6, 1975,
Maria Paz Concepcion, a 16-year old girl, and her brother Cresencio, were at
the fair grounds in San Francisco Del Monte, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Quezon </span>City, viewing the shows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They had just attended mass at the San Pedro Bautista parish church <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(pp. </span>2-3, tsn, October 6, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After quite sometime, Maria felt thirsty so
she and her brother proceeded to a 'sago' vendor to buy 'sago'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While she was drinking the 'sago' that she
bought, she saw three men looking at her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One of the three men was the accused Jesus Ramos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">two </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">were </span>Patrolman Armando Prila and Leonardo
Go, also known as Nonong Go (pp. 3-6, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975; pp. 5-8, tsn, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">May </span>7,
1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Maria and not pay attention to the<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>three men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After drinking
the 'sago', she placed her glass on the counter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused approached her and introduced
himself. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>He asked her name, age, and
whether she was still studying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
answered all the questions of the accused (pp. 4-6, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, Pat. Prila also introduced himself (p.
6, tsn Oct. 6, 1975).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused offered to conduct Maria and her companions
home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, she refused because she
already had companions (her other brother Joselito and a neighbor had joined
them at the `sago' stand).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the
accused and his companions insisted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and </span>Prila
were in uniform she consented <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(p. </span>7,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">tsn, </span>Oct.
6, 1975; p. 10, tsn, May <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">7, </span>1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It was already about 11:00 o'clock <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the evening when Maria her group,
and accused and his group, left the fair grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The route they took was<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>Roosevelt
Avenue (p. 8, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
they were walking along Roosevelt Avenue they stopped in front of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>drugstore.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Prila and Nonong Go then led the
companions of Maria away from her, so that accused could be alone with her (p.
9, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Prila and Go offered the companions of Maria twenty centavos
and told them to go home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They refused
to accept the money (p. 17, tsn, May 7, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At first they also refused to go home without <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Maria, </span>but the policemen threatened to put them in jail if they
did not do so (p. 17, tsn, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">May </span>7,
1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On being threatened, they ran
home leaving Maria behind (pp. 19-20, tsn, May 7, 1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When Maria saw <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">his </span>companions
running away, she told them to wait for her but they did not hear her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was about to run after them, but accused
held her arms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the return of Prila <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">and </span>Go, accused told Maria to join them
in patrol.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She refused to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">go </span>with them, but the accused pulled
her and led her to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">an </span>apartment
at Del Monte Avenue (pp. 10-12, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon arrival<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>at the
apartment, Prila and Go entered while accused pulled Maria inside (pp.
11-13-14, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused
pushed her down the sofa and sat beside her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He placed his hands on her shoulder and began whispering to her that he
would like to court <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">her (p. 1</span>4,
tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Maria tried to remove the hands of the accused from her
shoulder, but she failed because he was stronger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked Prila and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">Go </span>to remove the hands of the accused from her shoulder but the
two just laughed (pp. 14-15, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria told the accused that she did not want
to be courted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused arose and asked
for a newspaper from Nonong Go.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
getting the newspaper, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">accused went </span>out
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the apartment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(p. </span>15, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a short<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt"> while </span>the
accused came back to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He invited Maria to go outside with him as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">he wanted </span>to tell her something.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria answered that he could do it inside the
apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused got hold of her hand
and pulled her outside where it was very dark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maria told the accused to release her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of doing so, accused covered <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">her </span>mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this
juncture, accused placed his hand on his gun and told Maria not to shout o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">r </span>say anything, or else <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">would </span>shoot her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
accused pulled her to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">a </span>vacant
lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 15-17, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When they were already on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">the </span>vacant lot, accused tried to force her to sit on the
newspaper which he had spread on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She refused, so the accused got hold of her shoulder <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and </span>pushed her down (p. 18, tsn, Oct.
6, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While she was in that
position, accused removed his pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">She </span>tried to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">stand </span>up but she was forced by the accused to lie down (p. 18,
tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She then tried to
fight accused but she failed because he was stronger <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">and </span>bigger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused
kissed her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">raised
</span>her skirt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and </span>forcibly
removed her shorts (p. 19, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then he removed his brief placed himself on top of her and slowly
inserted his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">penis
into </span>her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She struggled
but the accused got hold of his gun and poked it to her head, warning her not
to shout or else he would kill her <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">and
</span>the members of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">her </span>family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She became
afraid (p. 20, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">tsn, </span>Oct. 6,
1975).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The first intercourse took place at about 2:15 in the
morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the intercourse, Maria
sat up because her <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">vagina </span>was
painful and her body was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">aching.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>When the accused saw her witting up,
he made her lie down again and had sexual intercourse with her for the second
time (p. 22, tsn, Oct. 6. 1975).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the second intercourse, the accused told Maria to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">dress </span>up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then they proceeded to a place where a jeep
was parked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prila and Go were there
waiting for them (p. 22, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).</blockquote>

home after <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the </span>curfew (p. 23,
tsn, Oct. 1975).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the curfew, Nonong Go offered <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">to accompany Maria </span>home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Along the way, however, he tried to make, advances to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She repelled his advances and threatened to
report him (pp. 23-24, tsn, Oct. 6, 1975).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When she reached home, Maria did not immediately report that she
had been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">rape be</span>cause she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">was afraid </span>of the threat of
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead when her father asked
her where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">she </span>had been, she told
him that she slept in the house of a friend <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

following Sunday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At 3:30 in the afternoon of Sunday she and her sister went to

the findings of fact of the lower court and the credibility of witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our jurisprudence is replete with pronouncements
that an appellate court which has only the cold records of the case before it
will not disturb the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of
having seen and heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner of
testifying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only exception to the
rule is when the trial court plainly overlooked certain facts and circumstances
of weight and influence which, if considered, will materially alter the result
of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that complainant is an untrustworthy witness
since; contrary to her claim of virginity, she was no longer a virgin when she
was allegedly raped on February 6, 1975, in view of the findings of Dr.
Desiderio Moraleda, PC Medical Officer who examined her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the N.B.I. findings show that complainant's
condition at the time of examination was compatible with her having sexual
intercourse with a man at or about the time of the commission of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Second, virginity is not an essential element in rape and the character of the
offended party in rape committed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>force
is immaterial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, assuming, for the sake of argument that complainant was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>virgin, the crime of rape was
nevertheless committed because appellant had sexual intercourse with her by
means of force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Third, the lower court has
"scrutinized with the greatest caution the testimony of Maria Paz"
and "has listened carefully to her testimony and has found it to be
straightforward and honest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

position to appreciate her credibility having heard complainant's testimony and
observed her demeanor in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant next points to the so-called discrepancies and
inconsistencies in the prosecution evidence relative to the time lapse between
the first and second intercourse and the place <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>Such inconsistencies and discrepancies are merely on minor details not
material to the case and do not affect credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If at all, these reinforce rather than weaken
the testimony of complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A witness
whose testimony is perfect in all aspects, without <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

beautifully with one another, lays herself open to suspicion of having been
coached or having memorized statements earlier rehearsed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
