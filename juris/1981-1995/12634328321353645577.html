charged (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 28; 30-31).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial of the case ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution’s lone witness, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Capinpin</span>, an auditor of the COA assigned in National
Food Authority (NFA) whose duties were to pre-audit, and post-audit claims and
disbursements of accountable officers in said office, declared that he
conducted an audit examination of the accounts and accountabilities of the
accused comprising the period from January 20, 1976 to January 24, 1980 after
receipt of a copy of “Cash on Hand Per Count Report” made by the resident
auditor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and together with the other
members of the special audit team created by NFA who conducted the
investigation, divided the work by the assignment of a particular account to
audit to each of them and came up with a report, the results of which may be
summarized in the following manner:</p>

<p class="BODY">The cash advances of herein petitioner under the Cereal
Procurement Fund (CPF) as Special Disbursement Officer have a total of
P10,543,165.56 while her cash disbursements amounted to P10,115,620.49, leaving
a shortage of P427,545.07.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
operational funds from <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="1">January 20,
 1976</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1980</st1:date>
amounted to P13,019,344.78 while credits to her accountability <span class="SpellE">totalled</span> P12,442,951.82, thus leaving <span style="">a </span>shortage of P576,392.96.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her record of collections and deposits for
the same period shows that she had debits to her accountability <span style="">in </span>the total amount of P13,305,659.18,
whereas the credits thereto amounted to P13,101,762.02.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there is a shortage of
P203,897.16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these shortages reached
<span style="">a </span>total of<span style=""> </span>P1,207,835.19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Hearing of August 3, 1981, TSN, 9-21;
Hearing of February 28, 1984, TSN, pp. 93-97).</p>

<p class="BODY">When asked to explain the entries in the Audit Examination
Report, <span class="SpellE">Capinpin</span> clarified each and every item under
investigation, such as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cereal
Procurement Fund which is the summary of the accountabilities of the accused as
special disbursing officer for the period covered, <st1:date year="1977" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1977</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Debit to accountability refers to the cash advances and replenishments
made by the special disbursing officer to serve as her fund for the purchase of
<span class="SpellE">palay</span> in connection with the procurement operation of
the NFA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The advances were in the form
of cash supported by cash vouchers, replenishment vouchers which are also
supported by purchase receipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
purchase receipts were the actual expenses or disbursements made by the special
disbursing officer for the procured <span class="SpellE">palay</span> in her
capacity as special disbursing officer (Hearing of February 28, 1964, TSN, pp.
66-68).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the shortage found, a demand letter was sent to <span class="SpellE">Lucilyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Zambrano</span> dated <st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1980</st1:date> requiring her to
restitute or pay the said shortage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
date no restitution has been made by the accused (Hearing of August 3, 1981,
TSN, pp. 9-21).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> questions made by the
Court, <span class="SpellE">Capinpin</span> admitted that the report submitted by
the team does not contain references or cross references to the pertinent
supporting documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was embodied
in the transmittal letter was the total accountability on the net shortage of
the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The summary of
accountability of the accused, both <span style="">as </span>disbursing
officer and as special collecting officer are duly supported by general
schedules with references to their respective amount (Decision, <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 2559, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
24).</p>

<p class="BODY">He claimed that he personally examined all the entries contained
in the cash books, despite the absence of his signature to show that he had
actually made examinations thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">going </span>over the cash books he
counter-checked them with entries made by the accused herself, under the
columns “Treasury Warrant”, “Journal Voucher” or “Official Receipts” as against
the documents themselves, <span style="">and </span>found
that all the entries appearing in the cash books have their corresponding
vouchers (Hearing of November 26, 1984, TSN, pp. 155-156).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Capinpin</span> further declared that (a) the
number of the vouchers representing cash advances or replenishments to the
accused are all reflected in the schedules attached to the audit report; (b)
all vouchers recorded in the registers were obtained by the team and duly
accounted for; (c) the vouchers were not only checked but the audit team saw to
it that the supporting papers were complete; and (d) the audit team followed
COA standard procedures in conducting their examination (Decision, Criminal
Case No. 2559, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 62).<span style="font-size: 6pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense presented <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span>
Mateo as an expert witness, who is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and
private practitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Long before he
became a free lancer, he was connected with the government, employed as
Auditing Clerk of the Rice and Corn Administration (RCA) now NFA, then as a
proof clerk of the First United Bank, then with the COA as Assistant Auditor
until he worked abroad as Assistant Account of <span class="SpellE">Bauchi</span>
State Investment and Development Corporation in Nigeria which is a government
corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mateo claimed that he, together with a former COA Auditor and
personnel of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, started examining and
reviewing ten (10) boxes of exhibits of the prosecution late in September and
ended early in <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he submitted a written report to
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ontimare</span>, with a summary of his findings and
observations (Hearing of January 29, 1986, TSN, pp. 163-171).</p>

<p class="BODY">Cross-examined on his report, particularly on his statement that
the cash advances amounting to P1 million pesos were neither supported by cash
vouchers nor check vouchers, he explained that nowhere in the documents
submitted by the prosecution was he able to find the particular vouchers in
support thereof and hence should not be included as cash advances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confronted with Exhibits “YYYYY-1” to
“YYYYY-20” pertaining to twenty (20) check vouchers in the amount of P50,000.00
each with a total of P1 million pesos, he denied having seen them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, his examination shows that the
accused made disbursements amounting to more or less P1 million pesos but he
could not determine the total amount of disbursements as well as the total
accountability of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to his report, more than P800,000.00 was overstated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically, Mateo pointed out that the accused instead of
having a shortage of P1,207,835.19 as determined by the audit team, should be
credited with an average of P1,912,065.00 as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">As previously stated, <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span>
testimony was taken during the new trial granted by the Court after she had
waived her right to testify in her defense.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lucilyn</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Zambrano</span>
declared that since <st1:date year="1966" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1966</st1:date>
she occupied various positions in the defunct RCA, now NFA, during which time
she was never charged <span style="">administratively
or </span><span style="">criminally </span><span style="">nor was her attention </span>ever called to
any <span class="SpellE">anomally</span> or irregularities in the discharge of
her duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1975</st1:date>,
she was appointed Cashier I on a permanent basis at the NGA National Branch,
allegedly offered to her by Director <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabalu</span>, despite the fact that she had no units in accounting
but only in nursing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, she
accepted the position as an opportunity for promotion (Hearing of February 5,
1987, TSN, pp. 224-227).</p>

<p class="BODY">As Cashier I, her duties were to collect and disburse funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While her actual station was in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Regional Office, her area of responsibility includes <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span>
province.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a collecting officer, she collects the proceeds of the sale of
cereals like rice, corn and <span class="SpellE">sorgum</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although she did not actually participate in
the selling of cereals, the proceeds of the sale were turned over to her which
were evidenced by proper receipts and these receipts together with the amounts
that she received were entered by her in the cash books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pre-signed the receipts she issued
especially in the remote areas in the different buying stations and then she
collected the proceeds from her aides as against the receipts issued by
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transactions made were paid
either in cash by direct retailers or consumers or in checks by government
agencies <span style="">or </span>offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These checks were placed in the collection
report, made payable to the NGA, main office, and deposited in the Philippine
National Bank (PNB) on the following day.</p>

<p class="BODY">As Special Disbursing Officer (SDO), she went out to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and to <span class="SpellE">Maguindanao</span> for the purpose of disbursing
funds in her accountability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
submitted her periodic report weekly to the accounting section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These reports were denominated as Collection
and Disbursement reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former
included the sales of cereals while the latter was divided into many
accounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During this period, she was
also audited in her accountabilities and there was no shortage found <span style="">(Hearing of </span>February 5, 1987, TSN, pp.
233-243).</p>

<p class="BODY">During the fiscal year 1978, Auditor <span class="SpellE">Abundo</span>
of the NGA, called her to his office and he told her that her account was
liquidated by him and he found a shortage of ten thousand (P10,000.00) pesos in
the Cereal Procurement Funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from
the fact that she was still under <span style="">liquidation
</span>at that time, the finding of <span class="SpellE">Abundo</span> was not
reflected in any report nor was any official action taken thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, <span class="SpellE">Abundo</span> offered to help
her with the shortage, for a certain amount.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And so she gave him P5,000.00 from her personal funds and later for cash
advances of P200,000.00 from the office funds for which <span class="SpellE">Abundo</span>
did not sign receipts nor did he liquidate them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from <span class="SpellE">Abundo</span>, she gave also cash
advances to Regional Director <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabalu</span> amounting to P80,000.00 for his representation
expenses, salaries, fish to be sent to <span class="SpellE">Malacanang</span> and
also personal expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cash
advances were covered by receipts but <span class="SpellE">Cabalu</span> was able
to liquidate the amount of P70,000.00 only which she turned over to Imelda
Marquez, Cashier of the NGA, after she was investigated by the MSD and she did
not know if the MSD was aware of the <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>
cash advances of <span class="SpellE">Cabalu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was informed later that the investigation
conducted by MSD revealed that she incurred a shortage of P500,000.00, more or
less (Hearing of February 6, 1987, TSN, pp. 253-270).</p>

<p class="BODY">She also admitted that she has a cash advance of one million
pesos in one voucher only but she did not use this amount for her own personal
use.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This cash advance was given to
Manager <span class="SpellE">Serio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pituc</span> of
Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> on the instructions of Director <span class="SpellE">Cabalu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one
million pesos cash advance was recorded in her name, then it was given to
Manager <span class="SpellE">Pituc</span>, who signed the original of the voucher
in the presence of the cashier of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> and
Mrs. Marquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although she was furnished
a copy of the report of the audit team finding her short of one million plus,
she was not given a chance to explain her position (Hearing of May 28, 1987,
TSN, pp. 285-291).</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, she admitted that she cannot validly
disburse an amount of P1 million pesos because her disbursement ceiling was
only P150,000.00 (Hearing of <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="5">May 29,
 1987</st1:date>, TSN, pp. 296-302).</p>

<p class="BODY">On re-direct, she explained that the cash advances given to <span class="SpellE">Cabalu</span> were not credited in her favor and that the cash
advance of P1 million pesos in one single transaction despite her cash
disbursement ceiling of P150,000.00 was approved by the Regional Director and
it passed through accounting procedures leading her to presume that the voucher
was in order (Hearing of May 29, 1987, TSN, pp. 303-306).</p>

<p class="BODY">In reply to the questions asked by the Court, she said that she <span style="">gave</span> cash advances to <span class="SpellE">Abundo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabalu</span>, Regional
Auditor and Regional Director of the NGA respectively ranging from the amount
of P200,000.00 to P1 million pesos despite their failure to execute the proper
documents or receipts out of fear, that she might be kicked out of her job or
transferred to another station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, she believes that she will not be held liable for the shortage
because these are circumstances that would justify or exempt her from criminal
liability (Hearing of May 29, 1987, TSN, pp. 307-312).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1988</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful study of the records of this case, including the
detailed testimony of the witnesses, no cogent reason can be found to depart
from the conclusion reached by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> that
petitioner had indeed been <span style="">negligent </span>in
the handling of the funds which had been turned over to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the crime of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>, all that
is necessary for conviction is proof that the accountable officer had received
the public funds and that he did not have them in his possession when demand
therefore was made and he could not satisfactorily explain his failure so to
account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An accountable public officer
may be convicted for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> even if there is no
direct evidence of personal misappropriation, where he has not been able to
explain satisfactorily the absence of the public funds involved (De Guzman v.
People, 119 SCRA 337 [1982]; <span class="SpellE">Bacasnot</span> y Callao v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 155 SCRA 379 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 217 <span style="">of </span>the
Revised Penal Code, there is <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> where the accountable public officer fails to
have duly forthcoming any public funds with which he is chargeable upon demand
by duly authorized officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this
Court has pointed out, this presumption <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>tantum</u></span> is founded upon human experience (<span class="SpellE">Estepa</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 182 SCRA
269 [1990]) and shall be <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence that he/she has put
such missing funds or property to personal use (<span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>
v. People, 194 SCRA 73 [1991]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner was neither able to produce the
missing amount of P1,207,835.19 nor adequately explain her failure to produce
that amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner failed to offer any convincing evidence to support her
alternative claims that she did not incur any shortage in her
accountabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She even tried to
exculpate herself but in vain, by throwing blame on others for her failure to
account for the missing money, making it appear that she was either acting
under orders of her superiors or that she acted out of fear or duress, but as
correctly found by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> her testimonial
evidence does not clearly or positively establish the legal or factual bases
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among others, she knew that the
supposed orders of her superior were not for a lawful purpose or even if
lawful, as she claimed them to be, the means used to carry out said orders were
not lawful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She admitted she did not use
the proper official forms or procedures in doling out funds belonging to the
government and more importantly she exceeded her cash disbursement ceiling for
the disbursement of funds amounting to P150,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her defense witness Mateo while pointing out that the missing
cash advances including the P1,000,000.00 were not duly supported by check or
cash voucher, failed <span style="">or </span>omitted
to explain why they were posted in the cash books of the accused, in her own
handwriting if she really did not receive them (Decision, Criminal Case No.
2559, pp. 49-52; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 62-65).</p>

<p class="BODY">Conversely, the audit examination made was based on petitioner’s
own cash books and all the checks and vouchers were duly checked and
verified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the People’s witness
declared that (a) the numbers of vouchers representing cash advances or
replenishments to the petitioner are all reflected in the schedules attached to
the audit report; (b) all vouchers recorded in the registers were obtained by
the team and duly accounted for; (c) the vouchers were not only checked but the
audit team saw to it that their supporting papers were complete; and (d) the
audit team followed COA standard procedures in conducting their
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by respondent
court, the evidence presented by the prosecution in its totality is
overwhelming and conclusive (Decision, Criminal Case No. 2559; p. 52; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 65).</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, the elements of the crime imputed to the petitioner in
the information were duly established not only by the testimony of the
prosecution’s only witness but also by the documentary evidence offered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the foregoing circumstances, it is evident that the defense
has not successfully rebutted the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> presumption of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence of the prosecution is overwhelming and has not been overcome by the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumed innocence of
the accused must yield to the positive finding that she <span class="SpellE">malversed</span>
the sum of P1,207,835.19 to the prejudice of the public whose confidence she
has breached.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the petition is DENIED and the
assailed decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> is AFFIRMED in
all respects.</p>
