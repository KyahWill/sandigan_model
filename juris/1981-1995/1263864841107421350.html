				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A collective bargaining agreement was entered into on <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1978</st1:date> between Vassar
Industries, Inc. (hereafter, simply Vassar) and the Vassar Industries Employees
Union (hereafter, simply the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The agreement stipulated a term of three (3)
years and, among other things, obliged -</p>

<blockquote>1) Vassar “ . . . to grant a general wage increase of P15.00 a
month for each employee covered by the agreement," and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) Vassar and the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> to re-negotiate
"on salary increase on the second and third year of ** (the) agreement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In 1980, the third year of the agreement and as stipulated
thereby, the parties re-negotiated on the matter of wage increases but failed
to reach a mutually acceptable arrangement thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue was thereupon submitted for
compulsory arbitration to Labor Arbiter V. G. Son.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter succeeded in effecting an accord
between the parties on March 6, 1981, subsequently embodied in an order, which
pertinently provided that “<i>the</i> salary increase for the 3rd year of the
current CBA, that is, October 1, 1980 to September 30, 1981, shall be P1.25 per
day, effective October 1, 1980."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1981</st1:date>,
Wage Order No. 1 was promulgated by former President Marcos by virtue of his
"stand-by legislative authority."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> The law thus promulgated increased
the mandatory cost-of-living allowance of non-agricultural workers to P2.00 per
day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It however allowed the crediting in
the employer's favor of certain increases in wages as might have been granted
to the employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The relevant provision
of Wage Order No. 1 reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 6 - All increases in wages granted unilaterally or by CBA
shall be credited as compliance with this Wage Order provided such increases
were granted between <st1:date year="1981" day="1" month="1">January 1,1981</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1981</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1981</st1:date>,
the National Wages Council promulgated the rules implementing Wage Order No. 1,
one of which provided for the crediting by the employer of certain benefits
against the increase in emergency cost of living allowance imposed by the wage
order, <span class="SpellE"><i>viz</i></span><i>:</i></p>

<blockquote>SEC. 8 – <i>Creditable Benefits</i>. - All increases in wages and
allowances granted unilaterally or by collection agreement may be credited as
compliance with the emergency cost of living allowances under the Order,
provided such increases were granted between January 1, 1981 and the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Order; ***.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For purposes hereof, the increase shall refer
to general increases given to all workers but excluding those resulting from
regularization, promotion and merit increases, as well as anniversary increases
under Collective Bargaining Agreements.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What Vassar did, by way of implementation of the law, Wage Order
No. 1, was to pay to its workers only P0.75 per day commencing on March 22,
1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to it, the increase in
the salary of each of its workers of P1.25, which it had earlier given pursuant
to the amicable agreement before Arbiter V. G. Son, <i>supra</i>, was
creditable as compliance with the Wage Order; and it needed to add to it only
P0.75 per worker per day to constitute complete payment of the increased daily
allowance of P2.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Union disagreed, and filed a complaint to compel Vassar to
pay not only the additional cost-of-living allowance prescribed by Wage Order
No. 1 in the sum of P2.00 per day, but also the P1.25 increase in the daily
salary of each worker stipulated in the amicable agreement of March 6, 1981
which, it theorized was not creditable as compliance with said Wage Order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as NLRC Case No.
AB-IV-10-528-81.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter
rendered judgment in the Union's favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was affirmed on appeal by the National Labor Relations Commission
by decision promulgated on June 9, 1986, assented to by the Chairman<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
and six (6) members,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> with three (3) commissioners
dissenting.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>, filed on January 6,
1987, seeks the nullification of the majority decision of the NLRC as having
been rendered with grave abuse of discretion, being clearly inconsistent with
the law, Wage Order No. 1, as well as pertinent precedents laid down by this
Court, i.e., <i>Dole Philippines, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>,
Jr.,</i> 117 SCRA 938; <i>National Federation of Sugar Workers v. <span class="SpellE">Ovejera</span>,</i> 114 SCRA 354; and <span class="SpellE"><i>Brokenshire</i></span><i>
Memorial Hospital v. NLRC</i>, 143 SCRA 364.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A "Verified Supplemental Petition" was filed by Vassar
fifteen days later (on January 21, 1987) in which it alleged <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> that ?</p>

<p class="BODY">1) its factory in Sta. Rosa, Laguna "had closed its
operations * * (and) only 31 members of the respondent union remain employed
with petitioner's <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
office which is still operating * *;" and</p>

<p class="BODY">2) the employment of all members of the Union, then employees at
the Sta. Rosa factory, "had already been terminated," and "they
were paid all their claims for unpaid wages, separation pay, overtime pay,
night differential pay, leave pay, differential pay or any other benefits as
may be due from petitioner by reason of the employment with the firm, while the
case was pending appeal before the respondent Commission, by reason whereof
they executed individual Deeds of Quitclaim and Release, with the exception of
some who had resigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his Comment of January 20, 1987, opined
that the increase of P1.25 per day granted by Vassar on March 6, 1981 was
"an anniversary increase and should not be credited as compliance with
Wage Order No. 1," said increase being "in effect, ** an integral
part of an existing CBA that bound both complainant (the Union) and respondent
(Vassar)." The private respondents<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> advocate the same theory in their
own Comment dated October 28, 1987,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> and additionally assert that the
precedents cited by Vassar are inapplicable, and the execution by the
individual members of the Union of quitclaims and releases, assuming that they
had in truth done so, does not preclude their claiming the balance of the
cost-of-­living allowances in accordance with Wage Order No. 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law (Wage Order No. 1), for that it was, having as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> been promulgated by President Marcos in the
exercise of his "stand-by legislative authority," provided that
"(a)<span class="SpellE">ll</span> increases in wages granted unilaterally
or by CBA shall be credited as compliance with this Wage Order provided such
increases were granted between January 1, 1981 and March 22, 1981." It
made no distinction as to the nature of the increases in wages, as anniversary
or otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But such a distinction was
made in the implementing rules issued by the National Wages Council.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question is whether a <i>law</i>
authorizing an administrative agency to promulgate <i>implementing rules</i>
may be restricted or modified in its scope by any implementing rule thus
promulgated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue, more
particularly, is whether the law, Wage Order No. 1 -- explicitly authorizing
that increases in wages, without distinction, granted unilaterally or by CBA
shall be credited as <i>pro <span class="SpellE">tanto</span></i> compliance with
its requirement on employers to pay additional emergency cost of living
allowances -- may be modified by an implementing rule which <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> declares as <i>not </i>creditable, <i>anniversary
increases</i> under collective bargaining agreements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue has already been presented to and
resolved by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a case
presenting strikingly analogous facts, <span class="SpellE"><i>Cebu</i></span><i>
Oxygen &amp; Acetylene Co., Inc. (COACO) v. Secretary <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>,
etc., et al.,</i> G.R. No. 82849, promulgated on August 2, 1989, the Court <i>en
banc</i> (per <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, <i>J</i>.) resolved the issue
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As to the issue of the validity of Section 8 of the rules
implementing Republic Act No. 6640, which prohibits the employer from crediting
the anniversary wage increases provided in collective bargaining agreements, it
is a fundamental rule that an implementing rule cannot add or detract from the
provisions of law it is designed to implement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The provisions of Republic Act No. 6640 do not prohibit the crediting of
CBA anniversary wage increases for purposes of compliance with Republic Act No.
6640.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The implementing Rules cannot
provide for such a prohibition not contemplated by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Administrative regulations adopted under legislative
authority by a particular department must be in harmony with the provisions of
the law, and should be for the sole purpose of carrying into effect its general
provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law itself cannot be
expanded by such regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
administrative agency cannot amend an act of Congress (Manuel v. General
Auditing Office, 42 SCRA 660 [1971] cited).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, petitioner's contention that the salary increases
granted by it pursuant to the existing CBA, including anniversary wage
increases, should be considered in determining compliance with the wage
increase mandated by Republic Act No. 6640, is correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the amount that should only be credited
to petitioner is the wage increase for 1987 under the CBA when the law took
effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The wage increase for 1986 had
already accrued in favor of the employees even before the said law was
enacted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The ruling is consistent with the
rationale of the cases invoked by the petitioner:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Dole Philippines, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, Jr.</i>, 117 SCRA 938; <i>National Federation of
Sugar Workers v. <span class="SpellE">Ovejera</span></i>, 114 SCRA 354, and <span class="SpellE"><i>Brokenshire</i></span><i> Memorial Hospital v. NLRC</i>, 143
SCRA 364.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although these three (3) cases
involved an additional 13th month pay mandated by Presidential Decree No. 851,
and not an increase in emergency cost-of-living allowance which was decreed by
Wage Order No. 1, all four cases do have a common message, i.e., that a
"double burden" may not be imposed upon an employer except by clear
provision of law.</p>

It is claimed by Trade Unions of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Allied Services (TUPAS), through its counsel, <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
and Associates, that "as early as in ** 1984," Vassar's employees
disaffiliated from ** (their original union) and organized themselves as a new
and distinct labor organization as Vassar Industries Workers Union (TUPAS Local
Chapter No. 1105)" (<span class="SpellE"><i>Rollo</i></span>, pp. 71-72</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
The pleading (<span class="SpellE"><i>Rollo</i></span>, pp. 86-97) was filed by
the private respondents' original counsel, Atty. Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Maghari</span>,
who (1) had earlier filed a "Notice of Attorney's Lien" dated August
16, 1987 (<span class="SpellE"><i>Rollo</i></span>, pp. 78-79), (2) declared that
the majority of the Union members had not <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span>
him, and (3) questioned "the ethics and <span class="SpellE">delicadeza</span>"
of Atty. Benjamin C. <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
&amp; Associates (<span class="SpellE"><i>Rollo</i></span>, 99-101), Atty. <span class="SpellE">Maghari</span> later filed an urgent motion for an early
resolution of the case and to require Vassar to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond (<span class="SpellE"><i>Rollo</i></span>, pp. 110-111).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span>
&amp; Associates subsequently advised the Court of the expulsion from <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span> Federation of said Atty. Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Alar</span>
who had consequently lost authority to represent the private respondents
(Undated Manifestation and Appearance of Counsel filed on July 22,1988, <span class="SpellE"><i>Rollo</i></span>, pp. 114-115).</p>
