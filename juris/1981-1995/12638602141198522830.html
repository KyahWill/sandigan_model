</span>He alleged that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was dismissed without lawful </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cause </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

deliberate and malicious intent but from honest mistake and oversight. He
averred that on March 10, 1984, on the night he was about to turn over to the
company the proceeds of his sales, he noticed a discrepancy of about P100.00 in
his liquidation report; that after he checked his papers he found that the
Incoming Load Report issued by the gate guard declared only five (5) cases of
empty bottles while the duplicate copy issued by the stock clerk listed fifteen
(15) cases of empties; that as he was about to correct the report, an
unscheduled brown-out occurred; that he immediately submitted the uncorrected
report to the pre-audit personnel with the intention to settle the error the following
day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further related that after he
was informed by the cashier of his shortage, he immediately paid the amount of
P100.00; that on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">May 12, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, he was grounded, and, that he submitted to

received a letter terminating his services on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">June 26, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
pointed out that it is unlikely that he would bargain his seven years of
dedicated service to the Company for a measly sum of P100.00, and stated that
the Company was bent on terminating his services because he was an active union
officer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">To rebut Vega's
allegations of honest mistake and oversight, however, Coca-Cola Bottlers
Philippines, Inc. outlined the procedure for the liquidation of sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It contended that because of the sensitive
nature of a sales agent's job, a system of liquidation </span>was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">required which consists of daily checks on
the goods and accomplishment of several documents which are subject to regular
audit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It narrated that on March 10,
1984, upon entering the company's </span>premises, Vega had the contents of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>truck examined by the guard; that
he prepared three (3) copies of the Incoming Load Report (ILR), one copy for
him, one copy for the guard, and one for the files in a box; that the copy in
the files listed five (5) cases of empty bottles; that thereafter, when Vega
entered the plant, the plant checker examined his cargo and prepared two copies
of checker slips, one copy for the stock clerk and one for Vega; that once
inside the plant, Vega prepared his Route Sales Report (RSR) and turned over to
the cashier and finance officer the RSR, ILR and checker slips together with
the cash collection; that upon audit, it was discovered that while the ILR and
checker slips listed only five (5) cases of empty bottles, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the RSR listed fifteen (15) cases; that it
was also learned that Vega's copy of the ILR and checker slips were altered and
also listed fifteen (15) cases; that due to the dis­crepancy the company was
defrauded in the amount of P100.00 more or less.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Coca-Cola Bottlers
Philippines, Inc. alleged that <span class="GramE">It</span> cannot condone
Vega's acts because his job exposes him to financial transactions everyday. It
further averred that Vega's acts showed willful and malicious intent to defraud
the company and rendered him unworthy of its trust and confidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 24,
 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the Labor
Arbiter found in favor of Vega.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He ruled
</span>that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">any error in the entries in
the sales report was made unintentionally and may probably be due to the sudden
brown-out alleged by Vega.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He opined
that the penalty of dismissal was </span>too severe <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">considering </span>Vega's seven <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">years
of dedicated service to the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, he ordered the company to reinstate Vega to his former position
and to pay him full and complete <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and other
benefits at the rate of P2<span class="GramE">,280.00</span> a month until re-instated,
10% attorneys fees and the amount of P5,000.00 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

other incidental expenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On appeal to the National
Labor Relations Commission, the decision was modified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC was not convinced that the
falsification was unintentional.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
further observed that under company rules, the infraction calls for the penalty
of dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It, however, noted Vega's
seven years of service to the company and accordingly ordered his reinstatement
with only three (3) months <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Both parties appealed

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Coca-Cola Bottlers
Philippines, Inc. alleges that the NLRC erred in ordering Vega's </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reinstatement </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

contends that length of service does not warrant an employee's reinstatement
where there is a clear showing that he committed acts constituting just causes
of termination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, Vega
alleges that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in considering facts
not alleged in the labor arbiter's decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He further states that the NLRC erred in denying him full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> in spite of the fact that the labor arbiter
clearly found that Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. committed an unfair
labor practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We rule in favor of
Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
<span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> order of reinstatement based on the sole
ground of length of service does not find support in either law or
jurisprudence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">When adequately proven,
the dual grounds of breach of trust and loss of confidence constitute valid and
ample bases to warrant termination of an errant employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Manila Midtown Commercial Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Nuwhrain</span> (Ramada Chapter), <span class="GramE">159 SCRA 212 /_1988_/</span>)
The employee’s obligation to give his workers just compensation and treatment
carries with it the corollary right to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span class="GramE">148 SCRA 187 /_1987_/</span>) In the last cited case, this
Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Although as a rule this Court leans over backwards to help
workers and employees continue with their employment or to mitigate the
penalties imposed on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">them, </span>acts
of <span class="SpellE">dis</span>-honesty in the handling of company property
are a different matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus under Article 283 of the Labor Code, an employer may
terminate an employ<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ment for ‘serious
misconduct’ </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or for ‘fraud </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or willful breach by the employee of the

employer or representa</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">tive.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If there is sufficient evidence that an employee has been
guilty of a breach of trust or that his employer has ample reasons to distrust
him, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">labor tribunal cannot justly
deny to the employer the authority to dismiss such an employee."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is no question that
Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> is correct when
it states that Vega's position as a sales agent is of such a nature as to
require a substantial amount of trust and confidence on the part of the
employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The work of a salesman exposes
him to voluminous financial transactions involving his employer's goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The life of the soft drinks company depends
not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so much on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the bottling or production of the product since
this is primarily done by automatic machines and personnel who are easily
supervised but </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">upon </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">mobile and far ranging salesmen who go from
store to store all over the country or region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Salesmen are highly individualistic personnel who have to be trusted and
left essentially on their own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A high
degree of confidence is reposed in them when they are entrusted with funds or
properties of their employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As a general rule,
employers are allowed <span class="GramE">a wider</span> latitude of discretion
in terminating the employment of managerial personnel or those who, while not
of similar rank, perform functions which by their nature require the employer's
full trust and confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This must be
distinguished from the case of </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ordinary</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rank-and-file
employees, whose termination on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">basis of these same grounds
requires </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">higher proof </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of involvement in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
events in question; mere uncorroborated assertions and accusations by the
employer will not suffice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See Manila Midtown Commercial Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Nuwhrain</span>
(Ramada<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>Chapter) supra).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case of <u>San Miguel Corp. v.
National Labor Relations Commission</u> (142 SCRA 376, <span class="GramE">384 /_1986_/</span>),
this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Private respondent represents petitioner in his dealings with
the public.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When charges of theft of customer's
properties and misconduct on the job are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">imputed
on the sales agent, and these charges are supported with evidence, they constitute
sufficient reasons for termination </span>of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well established in our jurisprudence is the
right of an employer to dismiss an employee whose continuance in the service is
inimical <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>the employer's
interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Manila Trading and Supply,
Co. v. Philippine Labor Union, 71 Phil. 124; Engineering Equipment, Inc. v.
NLRC, 133 SCRA 752)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the employee's infraction was not his first
offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note that he was suspended
and grounded for other offenses he committed in 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We regret, then, that this Court is powerless
to extend to him the remedy of reinstatement even on the ground of equity based
on his length of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As this Court
held in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Piedad</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte Electric
Cooperative, Inc</u>. (153 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">500, </span>509
/1987/:</p>

<blockquote>"The precedents on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">issue
</span>before us are clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dismissal of
a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">dishonest employee is to the best interest
not only of management but also of labor (International Hardwood and Veneer Co.
of the <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>. v. <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Jr., </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">117 SCRA 967).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a measure of
self-protection against acts inimical to its interest, a company has the right
to dismiss its erring employees (Dole <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>, Inc. v.
National Labor Relations Commission, <u>supra</u>). An employer cannot be
compelled to continue in employment an employee guilty of acts inimical to its
interest, justifying loss of confidence in him (International <span class="SpellE">Hardowood</span> and Veneer Co., of the Philippines v. <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, Jr. <u>supra</u>; National Service Corporation v.
<span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jr</span> <u>supra</u>;
Engineering Equipment, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, <u>supra</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law does not impose unjust situations on
either labor or management." <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Because of the difference between the findings of the Labor
Arbiter and the NLPC, we have examined this aspect of the petition
carefully.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We affirm the NLRC conclusion
that there was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>clear
falsification of commercial documents in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tampered documents in the hands of Mr.
Vega and presented to he cashier and finance officer showed fifteen cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of <span class="SpellE">softdrinks</span>
bottles while the earlier copies of the same documents in the hands of the gate
guard </span>the stock clerk and in the files reflected only five cases
returned to the employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no
brownout yet when the "incoming load report" was given at the guard-house
and the checker slip given to the stock clerk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be reason for the discrepancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, why should a salesman prepare basic reports in the dark? The
tampering to reflect <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>bigger
number of returns was effected when the salesman presented his reports for the
cashier and finance officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
allegation that the salesman would not risk his job for such a small amount is
not a defense because minor pilferages or thefts carried on over a long period
of time through false reports or juggling of funds and properties may, as
intended by the employee, remain unnoticed but they would destroy the company
nonetheless if unchecked or tolerated, The Labor Arbiter is wrong; the NLRC is
correct insofar as the appreciation of facts Is concerned.</p>
