<p class="BODY">The facts of the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>found by the lower court based on the testimonies of AIC Lucio Flores,
Pat. Romeo Velasco, AIC Riza Galvan, and Lt. Ma. Rosa Armovit, and the exhibits
presented, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Last January 28, 1988, there was a report received by their
headquarters about illegal drug trafficking in Daraga, Albay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The names mentioned by their informer were
that of Joel and Rita Labriaga.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AIC
Flores, who talked with the informer, referred the latter to the Commanding
Officer of NARCOM, Major Crisostomo Zaidem, who requested the informer to make
test buy operation, giving the latter P20.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The three of them were the back up of the test buy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They therefore proceeded to the PNR site of Daraga, Albay for the
mission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the informer proceeded to
the house of Rita Labriaga to buy the prohibited merchandise, the 3 back up men
stayed behind, hiding themselves about 300 meters away.</blockquote>

<blockquote>About 5 minutes later, they met with the informer at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Daraga</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The informer said he was able to buy one tea
bag, so they again proceeded to the headquarters to make the report, According
to the informer, he bought the tea bag from Rita Labriaga herself and that Joel
Labriaga was there.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Major Zaidem forthwith ordered another agent, Elpidio Molinawe to
apply for search warrant, which was granted by Executive Judge Wenceslao
Villanueva of the RTC of Legazpi.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another test buy was arranged by Major Zaidem in the
afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The team <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>composed of Major Zaidem himself,
C1C Galvan, A1C Lucino Flores, Pat. Romeo Velasco, Sgt. Felipe Codilla, and
Sgt. Elpidio Molinawe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But before they
went on their mission, a briefing was conducted first, then at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">4:00 </span>p.m.</st1:time>
they proceeded to the place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A1C Riza Galvan was the one who was made the posseure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(sic) </span>in
the second test buy, with instruction to see if Joel and Rita were there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marked money in 4 five peso bills were also
given to Riza <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Galvan who was told to
make signals by </span>brushing his hair twice if both Rita and Joel were
present in the house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to Riza Galvan, he went direct to the store and was able
to talk to Rita.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told Rita he wanted
to buy marijuana, after which, upon receiving his (sic) money, Rita went inside
the room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she went <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">out, she was already with Joel, and was
carrying a plastic bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he opened
the plastic </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">bag, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">it contained the tea bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He therefore went near the window and
signalled his team by brushing his hair twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In no time, Major Zaidem and the rest of the team arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The NARCOM team immediately surrounded the subject house and
secured it because they were told that Joel was armed with a .38 caliber
pistol.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Joel was about to escape through the back door but was apprehended
by Pat. Velasco, who immediately searched him and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">found the 3 grams of marijuana plus one P5.00 marked bill and four
P100.00 peso bills.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>No firearm was however found on Joel who was then drinking with
Jesus Mape outside the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> house, but
within the fence of the Labriaga house when the search was made.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The search warrant was shown to Joel, after which, Major Zaidem,
Molinawe and Tuzon went inside and searched the house in the presence of a
radioman, neighbor of the Labriaga, who is Tony Impig, who acted as the
disinterested witness.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The result </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">the search inside the house was negative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The raiding team found nothing inside the
house, so, they left Tony Impig and Camilo Labriaga, the father of the accused
who </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a barangay councilman, sign papers stating
that the search was conducted orderly, and that nothing </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">found inside the house.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The team was however suspicious of Rita who was in jogging pants
but had bulges between her thighs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rita
was not therefore allowed to go to the comfort room pending search on her body.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As the search was going on, the mother of Rita fainted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was therefore brought to the Ago Hospital
in Albay, in company with Rita, Joel, Molinawe and some other NARCOM <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">men.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>From the hospital, Joel and Rita were brought to the NARCOM
headquarters at Camp Bagong Ibalon for investigation, and while there, the
NARCOM agents observed that Rita was very restless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, a female nurse, Lt. Ma. Rosa Armovit, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>asked to search the body of Rita
inside <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>private room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the nurse came out of the room, she was already carrying a bag
containing 115 grams of marijuana dried leaves (Exhibit C).</blockquote>

<blockquote>All the marijuana leaves were turned over to the PC Crime
Laboratory for examination whereby the result (Exhibit C), was positive that
they were marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lt. Ma. Rosa Armovit, a military nurse of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">PC </span>assigned at Camp Bagong Ibalon also
testified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said she just arrived in
her quarters, overlooking the NARCOM in Camp Bagong Ibalon at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1988</st1:date> when she was sent for by Sgt. Villanueva
to the NARCOM Headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
obliged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The persons in the NARCOM
office were Major Zaidem, and Juvy Ladislao, their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">psychologist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was told to
conduct body search on Rita Labriaga, so she requested for a private room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Juvy Ladislao was invited by her to go </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">i</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">nside
the room to act </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">witness in the search.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Inside the room, Lt. Armovit told Rita to undress but Rita was
reluctant to remove her loose (lawlaw) pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But according to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Lt. Armovit,
she insisted </span>so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Rita obeyed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Lt. Armovit said she found plastic bag tacked outside the pants of
Rita, which was wrapped in cellophane.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She therefore asked Rita to remove the bag but the later refused, so she
removed it herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, Rita told
her "Huwag mo na lang sabihin may<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">
nakitang balutan </span>sa <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">panty
ko.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Magbabayad na lang ako, kung magkano
ang gusto mo." According to Lt. Armovit, she said it cannot be because she
(Rita) had already ruined the lives of so many young ones.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lt. Armovit told Rita to dress up and when
they went out, she gave the bag to Major Zaidem</span><span style="font-size:

Laboratory at Camp Bagong Ibalon, <st1:place><st1:placename>Legazpi</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, examined one tea bag, one plastic
bag weighing 115 grams, and one bag containing 3 grams of suspected marijuana
leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She conducted the
internationally recognized standard tests for suspected marijuana leaves,
namely, duquenois levine and thin layer chromatographic examinations, the
results of which confirmed the suspicion that the subjects of examination were
leaves of the marijuana plant, which are covered by the Prohibited Drug Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The versions of the accused-appellants are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Rita narrated that:</p>

<blockquote>x x x she was in her father's house at PNR
Site, Daraga, Albay, last January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">28,
1988, together with her brother Joel, her mother Amalia, her daughter, and a
friend of Joel, Jesus Mape when NARCOM agents came and surrounded their
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NARCOM agents presented a
search warrant to Joel who read it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
Joel asked why, he was spanked on both ears by Sir Moliñawe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then the search warrant was also shown to her
father Camilo Labriaga.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Impig was
there as witness.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The NARCOM people found nothing in their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing was also found in the possession of
Joel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"God knows," according
to Rita, that Exhibits B and C were not found in the possession of Joel."
But during the search, her mother fainted and was brought to the hospital <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">by 3 NAR- COM agents with her and Joel accompanying.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>While her mother was being treated, Rita said Sir Moliñawe was
forcing her to go with them already to the NARCOM Headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, she refused to leave her mother but
she was practically <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">dragged by Moliñawe
to the car and brought to the NARCOM Headquarters at Camp Bagong Ibalon.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At NARCOM office, she and Joel were made to sit on a bench.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, a woman arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After 10 minutes, she was made to enter a
room where there were stoves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two
women also entered the room and ordered her to undress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They found nothing on her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, they told her to put her clothes
on.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When she came out, the two women were already carrying a plastic
bag.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">A </span>little later, she
was brought to the office of the provost <st1:city><st1:place>marshall</st1:place></st1:city>
where her blood pressure was taken which was found to be normal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that moment, according to Rita, Sir
Moliñawe and Pat. Velasco arrived and whispered to her to give money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked, "What for?" when she had
not done anything wrong?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both said they
will <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">give </span>the money to Major
Zaidem.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Joel likewise testified that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x
x </span>NARCOM agents went to their house at PNR Site, Daraga, Albay, about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pat. Romeo Velasco and Sgt. Moliñawe were among the NARCOM team.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only he, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>His father Camilo Labriaga however arrived <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>little later, together with a radioman named Tony Impig.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The search warrant was therefore presented to
his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">father.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Joel denied possessing marijuana that afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He however said he was spanked twice by Sgt.
Moliñawe on both ears.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But despite the
fact that the agents did not find anything in his possession, he was still
brought to the PC Headquarters at Camp Bagong Ibalon for nine (9) days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the evening of their arrest, his father went to them to give
food but was refused by Major Zaidem on the pretext that they may be
poisoned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was even made to identify
the P5.00 and P100.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">bills which came
from his father, which he did not identify but nevertheless, was not returned
by the agents anymore.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Joel said that on their way to the Camp, Pat. Romeo Velasco
allegedly demanded P10,000.00 for his liberty, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">plus </span>another amount from his sister, but that they refused
because the amount was too much.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
therefore told by Pat. Velasco that he had to be detained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">because he is facing another drug case in
another court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Rita may be released.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Although Pat. Velasco tried to extort money from them, he did not
file a case against the former because they have no witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The guard at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

testify for them.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Only one grossly inadequate brief was filed for both
accused-appellants and assigned only the following error:</p>

<blockquote>That the trial court erred in holding that accused Rita Labriaga
was a pusher, having sold (two) 2 tea bags of marijuana on two test buy
operations on January 28, 1988.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main defense of Rita <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is
</span>that the trial court can not use a particular piece of evidence to
convict her if the evidence was never presented in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were allegedly two (2) test buy
operations and two (2) tea bags of marijuana bought from her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the first tea bag of marijuana which <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>the product of the first "<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">buy-</span>bust" operation was not
presented and identified by the civilian informer and poseur-buyer, accused
Rita should be acquitted, the defense counsel submits.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly held that the appreciation of evidence and the
assessment of the credibility of witnesses rest primarily with the trial
courts.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The failure to present as evidence the first confiscated tea bag
is not fatal to the prosecution's case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nor would it impair the essential integrity of the prosecution's
evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>to the second
"buy-bust" operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">corpus
delicti </span>of the second entrapment of Rita on <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1988</st1:date>, as shown in Exhibit
"B" and the combined testimonial evidence presented, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>the real and direct proof of
Rita's culpability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold that this
suffices to sustain a judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of the prosecution witnesses disclose that Rita
was caught in a "buy-bust" operation conducted by officers and men of
the Narcotics Command in Albay, selling a tea bag of marijuana leaves and
possessing a plastic bag containing 115 grams also of marijuana leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These articles are described in the records
and can not be denied.</p>
