above-named accused, conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping

<blockquote>"In the evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="4">April
 9, 1987</st1:date>, Armando Q. Marcelo, who had been selling peanuts in a
pushcart for six (6) years, daily from <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning until <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, was at his usual stationary place near the
barangay market <span style="">at </span>Maharlika
Upper Bicutan, Taguig, <span class="GramE">Metro</span> Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(</span><span class="GramE">t.s.n</span>. pp. 23, <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noticed,
seated near the store of the Muslim trader, about seven (7) meters away from
him,<span style=""> (<u>Id</u>. </span>p. 4), the same
three men whom he had seen for <span style="">f</span>our
nights prior to April 9<span style="">, </span>1987,
hanging around the vicinity <span style="">of </span>the
Muslim trader's store <span style="">at </span>Bicutan
barangay market and thus<span style=""> </span>he had
become familiar with their faces.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Marcelo noticed on that particular night of April 7, 1987, (should
be April 9, 1987) that two of the men had something bulging from their waists
(t.s.n. p. 18, May <span style="">10, </span>1988) and
he mentioned this to his wife who<span style=""> </span>was
with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, while on previous
nights, they just sat down near the Muslim store, this time they walked back
and forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">One </span><span style="">of </span>them, whom
Marcelo later identified as Domer <span style="">Riego,
</span>even bought peanuts from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">t.s.n</span>. <span style="">pp. </span>4-5
&amp; 10, <u><span style="">Ibid</span></u><span style="">.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
place was well illuminated by a Meralco post (sic) and a Petroleum Coleman lamp
hanging from Marcelo's pushcart (t.s.n. pp. 8-10, <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1988</st1:date>).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At about <st1:time minute="25" hour="9">9:25 o'clock</st1:time> <span style="">of t</span>hat same evening, Marcelo saw
Crisostomo <span style="">Manalili </span>come out from
his store, the <span style="">CRN </span>Merchandizing
located across the street from <span style="">where </span>Marcelo
was vending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crisostomo walked <span style="">to </span><span style="">his </span>service <span style="">j</span>eep
parked in<span style=""> </span>front of the
store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the front seat of the jeep
were Crisostomo's brother-in-law Gilbert Gumabo, who was on (sic) the steering
wheel, Crisostomo's 10 year old daughter and Crisostomo's wife Virginia, who
carried on her lap her 3 year-old son.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Crisostomo Manalili was about to board the front seat of the jeep next
to the children - his hand was already grasping the <span style="">bar </span>located at the side of the window (t.s.n. pp. 7-9, April 26,
1988; t.s.n. p<span style="">p. </span>4-6, August 22,
1988; t.s.n. p. 3, October <span style="">5, </span>1988)
when suddenly, three men rushed towards the jeep, walking fast passing
Marcelo's side about four (4) meters away from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Serna was holding a .45 caliber gun
while the other whom Marcelo identified as Jojo Torres had a .38 caliber gun (t.s.n.
pp. 9-11, <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Domer stayed behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">t.s.n</span>. p. 9, <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as appellant Serna and Jojo Torres
reached the right side of the jeep they tried three times <span style="">to </span>grab the black clutch bag from
Crisostomo Manalili but the latter resisted and held tightly to his bag (t.s.n.
pp. 9 &amp; 11, April 26, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly, Marcelo heard three (3) successive gunshots ring out from the
gun held by appellant Serna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Manalili
fell down, Serna grabbed the black clutch bag and then pointed the gun and
continued firing at the occupants of the jeepney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
was hit first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she slumped <span style="">on </span>Gilbert's shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant then fired at Gilbert.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when he was hit, he slumped on the
steering wheel and played dead as the gun was still pointed at <span style="">him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>As
he slumped on the steering wheel, <span style="">his </span>sister
slid behind his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">t.s.n</span>. p. 6, <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="10">October
 5, 1988</st1:date>) Marcelo saw appellant grabbed (sic) the red plastic bag
inside the jeepney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Torres also fired
his gun when he was already near the pushcart when there was already somebody
chasing them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo instinctively
ducked behind his pushcart while looking at the shooting but he could not move
from the place <span style="">as </span>he was holding
his wife who had fainted after she <span style="">heard
</span>the gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">t.s.n</span>.
pp. 13-14, <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="4">April 26, <span style="">1988</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The robbers then fled,
with appellant Serna holding the two (2) bags he had forcibly grabbed from his
victims containing P150,000.00 (t.s.n. p. 14, August 22, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the trio fled, Gilbert stepped on the
gas of the jeepney and <span style="">sped </span>off
from the <span style="">crime </span>scene taking with
them Crisostomo Manalili <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>When Marcelo surveyed his surroundings, he then realized that the
other accused Domer Riego was no longer standing i<span style="">n</span> front of the Muslim store (t.s.n. p. 14, <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">After th</span>e<span style=""> lapse </span>of a few minutes, a
mestizo-looking man together with a stocky man approached Marcelo and inquired
whether he (Marcelo) saw the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Terribly afraid that he might be harmed by those men, Marcelo merely
answered that he did not see anything but only heard shots because a person
nearby informed him that those men making inquiries were CIS agents and that
mestizo-looking man gave him the creeps when he asked Marcelo the same question
thrice and they also found a .38 caliber gun tossed near the gutter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that mestizo who repeatedly <span style="">inquired from Marcelo </span>about the
incident was<span style=""> </span>one of the accused
still at large named Roberto Dunkel (t.s.n., pp. 14-16, <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1988</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Immediately after the incident, Marcelo was informed by his wife
that a man on a motor vehicle threw a letter (Exhibits "C" and
"C-1", p. 245., Records; t.s.n. pp. 3-7, May 10, 1988) after passing
their pushcart at the market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
letter contained words threatening his life, with a drawing of a hand and five
(5) dots appearing therein which drawings matched the markings on the hands of
the other accused Domer Riego, who prior to the incident in question bought
peanuts from said Marcelo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apprehensive
of his own life and those of members of his family, on <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1987</st1:date>, Marcelo moved to another
residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Ibid.).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon the written request of the Eastern Police District stationed
at Taguig, Metro Manila, Dr. Desiderio A. Moraleda of the Medico-legal branch
of the PC Crime Laboratory, PC/INP conducted an autopsy examination on the
cadaver of the late Crisostomo Manalili on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Exhibit "H", t.s.n, pp. 3-4, November 24, 1988).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of the request and the body of
the deceased, the nearest kin was required to identify the body and to sign a
written consent for autopsy. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was Rudy
Manalili who<span style=""> </span>sent a written
consent for the autopsy (Exhibit "I", p. 255, Records; t.s.n., p. 4,
November 24, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cause of death
of the deceased was ‘cardio-respiratory arrest <span style="">due </span>to shock and hemorrhage as a result of gunshot wounds of the
trunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Exhibits 'L',
'M', &amp; ‘M-1’, pp. 258-259, Records; t.s.n. pp. 10-11, <u><span style="">Ibid</span></u><span style="">.).</span></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Crisostomo Manalili sustained two (2) fatal gunshot wounds fired at
the middle right side at the back, the bullets travelling obliquely towards the
front left side lacerating the liver and diaphragm that caused his death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appearance of the wounds was compatible
with a .45 caliber slug.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A slug was
recovered from his body (t.s.n. pp. 6-7, <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Virginia sustained five (5) gunshot wounds on different parts of her
body which, according to Dr. Ernesto Brion of St. Luke's Hospital, in the
absence of any immediate attention Virginia Manalili could have caused <span style="">her </span>death; and that there is only an
80% probability of regaining her normal functions in relation to the five (5)
gunshot wounds she sustained if fully healed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two (2) slugs recovered from her body were compatible with a .45
cal. bullet based on the size of the wounds, the construction of the wounds and
particularly the shadow of the slug as reflected in the x-ray plate (t.s.n pp.
3, 10, 11, <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ten year old girl of the Manalilis
suffered burns on her left forearm, as she was then seated at the right side of
Virginia Manalili (t.s.n. p. 11, <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="8">August
 22, 1988</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gilbert Gumabo
was hit on the right cheek, (t.s.n. p. 8, <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1988</st1:date>), sustained a .05 cm. in diameter wound
on the right side of his face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
doctors treated him by dressing his wound and subsequently recommended a skull
x-ray (Exhibit "O", p. 262, Records; t.s.n. pp. 3-4, February 20,
1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Crisostomo Manalili left five children, ranging from four to
eighteen years old, the oldest of whom stopped schooling as <span style="">Virginia,</span> his widow, could no longer
support them and she needed the older son to help her in their business.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After he mustered enough courage and with the assurance of adequate
police protection, Marcelo, accompanied by policemen to whom he narrated for
the second time what he witnessed that evening of April 9, 1987, went to the
police headquarters at Taguig municipal building and voluntarily executed a
sworn statement dated April 28, 1987 (Exhibits "A" &amp;
"A-1", pp. 240-241, Records; t.s.n. pp. 16-17, April 26, 1988; t.s.n.
pp. 4-10, May 12, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 6, 1987, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, Pat. Jesus Chan attached to the
Intelligence and Special Operations Unit <span style="">(t.s.n.
</span>p. 14; <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1989</st1:date>)
was on surveillance with Santiago Villa and P/Cpl. Edgardo Mendoza, an
Assistant Chief in the Intelligence Unit of <span style="">Taguig </span>National Police Force.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were on surveillance of the various activities of the holduppers in
the Upper Bicutan Public Market at Taguig.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At around <st1:time minute="15" hour="19">7:15</st1:time> in the
evening, he apprehended Domer Riego for Illegal Possession of a knife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">t.s.n</span>. pp. 4-5 m <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1989</st1:date>) When the other accused
Domer Riego was arrested, Marcelo executed another statement on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1987</st1:date> positively identifying
Domer Riego as one of those who robbed and fired at Crisostomo Manalili as said
Domer was then armed with a .38 cal. firearm (Exhibit "B", p. 243,
Records, t.s.n. pp. 17-18, April 26, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">When Marcelo was fetched from his house by Pat.</span>
Jesus Chan to the municipal <span class="GramE">building,</span> said Domer was
seated <span style="">on a </span>sofa with some other
persons present therein and when he (Marcelo) was ushered inside the room, he
immediately recognized Domer and accordingly informed the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo pointed out Domer to the police from
among the other persons seated with Domer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No members of the family of the late Crisostomo Manalili were present
during the identification Marcelo made of Domer at the police station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was Marcelo present when Domer was
investigated by the police officers (t.s.n. pp. 10-12, <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1988</st1:date>).</blockquote>

identified himself to Pfc. Felixberto Maog as <span style="">Domer </span>Riego.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pfc. Maog

constitutional rights; his right to remain silent, right to counsel <span style="">of </span>his own choice and the consequences

</span>Domer said that he will give his sworn statement voluntarily even
without the presence of a counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">But </span>Pfc. Maog gave Domer a counsel, in

Per the statement of Domer Riego, <span style="">on </span>April
9, 1987, the group of one Roberto Dunkel, a PC Capcom soldier, Salvador Torres,
Jojo<span style=""> </span>Torres and appellant
Reynaldo Serna approached him in front of Upper Bicutan market and told him
that he will be utilized as a look-out for the group who had decided to rob
Crisostomo ‘Cris' Manalili.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Domer also
informed Pfc. Maog that he saw appellant shoot Crisostomo Manalili, his wife

<p class="BODY">Of the two accused who were found guilty, only Serna appealed the
decision of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Public
Attorney's Office (PAO) which represented the other accused, Riego, stated in
their manifestation that after the judgment of conviction by the lower court, a
relative of Riego said that a counsel de parte <span style="">would be </span>hired for purposes of an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said manifestation, the PAO asked this
Court for sufficient time to ascertain whether Riego still needed their service
since Riego had never communicated with them after the promulgation of judgment
of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court granted <span style="">a </span>period of thirty (30) days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said period has already lapsed.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE
DEFENSE OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT REYNALDO SERNA." (Rollo, p. 85)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the first assignment of error, the appellant assails the
credibility of the prosecution witnesses, specifically that of Armando Marcelo,
Virginia Manalili and Gilbert Gumabo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that it would have been rather difficult
for Marcelo to recognize the persons conversing under the awning of the <span style="">store </span>as it was already <span class="GramE">nighttime</span> and the light of a Meralco post which was above
that awning could not have provided enough illumination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, it would have been hard for
Marcelo to recognize the appellant as he did not know the appellant prior to
the nights he claimed to have seen him.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This contention must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The illumination coming from the lighted Meralco post, which was
six (6) meters away from <span style="">w</span>here
the appellant and the other accused were conversing and thirteen (13) to
fifteen (15) meters away from Marcelo's pushcart, (TSN, May 10, 1988, p. 10)
and the lighted Coleman petromax which was situated over <span style="">Marcelo's </span>head (TSN, M<span style="">ay </span>10, 1988, p. 9) was adequate enough
for Marcelo to recognize the appellant. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Marcelo was just seven (7) meters away from
where the appellant was (TSN, May 10, 1988, p. 13) and the appellant was even
facing him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN., May 10, 1988, p. 11)
Moreover, Marcelo is quite familiar with the appellant already as<span style=""> </span>he had been observing him and his
co-accused for the' past three days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was unusual for people to be hanging around the place and he was extra wary of
strangers has there was <span style="">a </span>previous
killing <span style="">in </span>the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 10, 1988, p. 14)</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant states that Marcelo could not have witnessed the
shooting as when it started, his wife fainted and he hid behind his pushcart.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Marcelo ducked behind his pushcart does not mean
that he could not have seen the event unfolding before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wooden pushcart was only three and a half
(3 1/2) feet high (TSN, May 11, 1988, p. 13) and a s<span style="">light </span>tilt of his head would <span style="">make </span>him witness the incident without any obstruction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inability of Marcelo to furnish the<span style=""> </span>identities of the perpetrators at the time he gave his first
statement is understandable since he could not have known the names of the
accused but when he saw their faces he readily identified them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Cabale, et. al., G.R. Nos.
73249-50, May 8, 1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also questions the inconsistency between Marcelo's
second statement given to the police claiming to have seen Riego armed with a
.38 revolver and his testimony of <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1988</st1:date> (p. 11) where he said that it was the other accused, Jojo
Torres who was carrying the .38 caliber revolver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Affidavits, taken <u><span style="">ex-parte</span></u><span style="">, </span>are
generally considered to be inferior to the testimony given in open court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court has consistently held that an
affidavit, taken <u>ex-parte</u>, is almost always incomplete and inaccurate,
sometimes from partial suggestions, sometimes from want of suggestions and
inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the
connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction of the first
suggestions of his memory and for his accurate recollection of all that belong
to the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Loveria, G.R.
No. 79138, July 2, 1990)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to </span>the alleged
inconsistencies between <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>'s
testimony and that of Marcelos, they are not on material <span class="GramE">points,</span>
therefore, do <span style="">hot </span>affect the
basic credibility of the evidence as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. Palino, et. al., G.R. No. 73044, March 26, 1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">Gumabo's testimony is also challenged by the appellant with
regards to Gumabo's statement that while he was hit in the face and slumped on
the steering wheel, he still managed to witness the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even before Gumabo was shot, <span style="">he </span>already saw the actual grabbing of his brother-in-law's clutch
bag <span style="">and </span>the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span style="">he
was </span>shot on the right cheek, he slumped on the steering wheel and
pretended to be dead as he might then be shot at again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this did not prevent him from witnessing
the incident as he positioned himself in such a way that he could still see the
assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, October 5, 1988, pp.
3-11) He could, therefore, identify their assailants, one of which was the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 19 day delay of Marcelo in reporting the incident can be
sufficiently explained by Marcelo's fear to reveal what he saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo received a threatening letter from an
unknown person which had the same markings as those that he saw on the hands of
one of the accused, Riego.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His fear was
so strong that he even transferred his work site (TSN, April 26, 1988, p. 14)
and his residence (TSN, April 26, 1988, p. 18).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been held that initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer
information about a criminal case, and their unwillingness to be involved in
criminal investigations, <span class="GramE">are</span> common, and have been
judicially declared not to affect credibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. Pacia, G.R. No. 69543, June 14, 1990) Marcelo was just an
innocent vendor who happened to be at a place where he felt he should not have
been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not want to get involved in
the first place but after careful deliberation, he felt that it was his duty to
report the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The one month delay in the execution of the sworn statements by
Virginia Manalili and Gilbert Gumabo is also justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Brion, the attending physician of
Virginia Manalili, explained that the five gunshot wounds <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
sustained could have resulted <span style="">in </span>her
death were it not for the immediate and appropriate medical and surgical
attendance given to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 26,
1988, pp. 8-9) The doctor further stated that she has to undergo rehabilitation
for <span style="">a </span>period of three months and
there would be only a recovery of 80% for her insofar as assuming her normal <span class="GramE">habits w<span style="">as</span></span>
concerned. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(TSN, May 26, 1988, pp. 7-8)
As for Gilbert, he testified that he was unable to give his statement earlier
as he was still in a state of shock due to the death of his
brother-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN,
October 5, 1988, p. <span style="">16).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
fact that he saw both <span style="">his </span>brother-in-law
and his sister being <span style="">s</span>hot and he
was shot himself proved to be too <span style="">much </span>for
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was even the one who drove his
brother-in-law to hospital to try and save him but to no avail as his
brother-in-law died after their arrival at the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, <span style="">May
</span>31, 1988, pp. 14-16)</p>

<p class="BODY">The injuries sustained by <st1:state><st1:place>Virginia</st1:place></st1:state>
and Gilbert, both physical and emotional, and the necessary period for
recuperation <span class="GramE">are</span> reasons enough to understand the
delay of one month.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second assigned error, the appellant questions the
admissibility in evidence of the extra?judicial confession of his
co-accused, Riego which implicates the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that it is inadmissible in evidence
and since his conviction was based on said confession, he must then be
acquitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such confession was allegedly
signed by Riego in violation of the latter's rights in <span style="">Art. </span>III, Sec. 12 of the 1987 Constitution which states:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 12.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Any person under investigation for the
commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to
remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his
own choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the person cannot afford
the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These rights cannot be waived except in
writing and in the presence of <span style="">counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No torture, force, violence, threat,
intimidation, or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secret detention places,
solitary, incommunicado, or other similar forms of detention are prohibited.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any confession or admission obtained in
violation of this or the preceding section shall be inadmissible in evidence
against him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Riego repudiated his confession in the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that during the time of
interrogation, he was not assisted by a lawyer, was not informed of his right
to have one, was not warned that any statement given by him may be used against
him in any court of law and was not asked if he wanted the presence of any
member of his family before taking his statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Futhermore, upon his refusal to sign said
document, his interrogators (the policemen) supposedly mauled him and
threatened to "salvage" him, forcing him to <span style="">sign </span>the document, the contents of which he was not even informed
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he denied having been a
graduate of <span style="">the </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Signal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place> when the document
contained such information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Riego also
denied knowing Atty. de Guzman who according to the testimony of Pfc. Maog
acted as counsel for the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence on record, the Court finds that Riego was assisted
by counsel and apprised of his constitutional rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">A close perusal of the extra-judicial statement (Exhibit
"N") indicates that Riego was informed of his right to remain silent
and his right to have an attorney present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Riego waived both rights in the presence of counsel which is evidenced
by the signature of the late Atty. de Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because of Riego's waiver of his right to remain silent, he was also
advised that anything he says may be used against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial court that:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court cannot help but notice that for every cautionary
question (to suit the constitutional requirement) coached in simple terms and
the corresponding answer, underneath on the right side of the question there
appears the signature of the accused and on the opposite left hand corner there
appears the signature of Atty. Luis de Guzman, then municipal attorney of
Taguig.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This format is consistent for
the next four other successive cautionary questions such that there were no
less than four signatures of the accused and that of Atty. Luis de Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that these questions were
simple, in the vernacular and easily understood by the accused." (Rollo,
p. 70)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, Riego's allegation of maltreatment was not
substantiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only injuries that
Riego could show during the trial was a supposed injury in the head which could
be a balding spot as he had thinning hair and a scar on his back which is less
than an inch in length.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, March 30,
1989, pp. 14-16)</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances surrounding Riego's confession are of no
significance in this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no
need to resolve the issue of the weight to be given, if any, to the confession
of a co-conspirator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Riego did not <span style="">appeal his conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the appellant is concerned,
Riego's confession can be totally disregarded without altering the results.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even without Riego's
extra-judicial confession, the appellant is still not exculpated from the crime
for which he was convicted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
positively identified by three witnesses, two </span>of <span style="">whom were the victims who survived the incident, Virginia Manalili and
Gilbert Gumabao and the other, a disinterested third party, Armando
Marcelo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All had a good </span><span style="">look </span><span style="">at him at the time he was committing the offense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the third assigned
error, the appellant puts up the defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that he was in his residence in
Pototan, Muntinlupa at the time the incident happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">( TSN</span>., March 15,
1989, p. 10)</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant's defense
is unmeritorious.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For alibi to prosper, the
requisites of time and place must be strictly met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be established by clear and
convincing evidence that the accused was at some other place and for such a
period of time as to negate his presence at the time </span>when and the pl<span style="">a</span>ce where the crime was
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(U. S. v. Oxiles, 29 Phil,
587, 593 [1915]; People v. Alcantara, 33 SCRA 812, 825-826 [1970])</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant's present
residence is in Pototan, Muntiniupa (his former residence was in </span><st1:place><span style="">Upper Bicutan</span></st1:place><span style=""> where he lived with his mother) which is contiguous
to the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">municipality</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span style="">Taguig</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">, where the incident happened.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both municipalities are in Metro Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial court, there <span style="">is </span>no substantial evidence to show that
it was physically impossible for the appellant to have been at the scene of the
crime at the time of its <span style="">commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant failed to prove that it
was impossible for him to be at <st1:place>Upper Bicutan</st1:place>,
Taguig.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He himself admitted that it only
takes an hour by passenger jeepney at that, to reach <st1:place>Upper Bicutan</st1:place>
from his place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, March 15, 1989, p.
8) It would then be an even shorter trip if one were to ride a private
vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant was also familiar
with the area of <st1:place>Upper Bicutan</st1:place> thus, he would have known
of the shortest route to take.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, the defense of alibi
cannot prevail over the clear and positive identification by the prosecution
witness of the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Pacala, 58 SCRA 370, 381 [1974])<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant further
states that </span><span style="">if </span><span style="">he was really guilty, then, he would not have
requested his arresting officer to bring him to the Manalili home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before the arrest of the
appellant, a certain Federico dela </span><span style="">Cruz
</span><span style="">had approached Virginia A.
Manalili with the appellant's photograph.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that time, Virginia Manalili pretended that she did not r</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">c</span><span style="">o</span><span style="">gnize
the appellant as she did not want to warn the appellant through dela </span><span style="">Cruz </span><span style="">that she could identify him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, May 18, 1989, pp. 20-21) She wanted the appellant to be thrown off
his guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This apparently worked as the
appellant was so sure of the fact that he would not be </span>identified<span style=""> </span>that <span style="">he even asked to be presented to </span>Virginia Manalili.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, <span style="">if </span>the appellant was really sincere <span style="">in </span>proving his innocence, he would have shown <span style="">up for </span>the preliminary investigation of
his case despite his alleged fear of reprisal as he could have sought police
protection in this regard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
<span style="">just </span>ignored the subpoena and
