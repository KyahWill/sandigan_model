<blockquote>"If Owner, at any time or times during the term hereof, shall

Owner does not promptly reject, to purchase the Premises or any part thereof,

<p class="BODY">Similarly, on <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="1">January 1,
 1976</st1:date>, NRHDC and HII assigned all their rights under the
above-mentioned agreement to petitioner Holiday Inn (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.),
Inc. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(HIP).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1986</st1:date>,
NRHDC was sequestered by the PCGG which subsequently appointed fiscal agents
and/or placed an operating team to monitor the activities of said corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of numerous controversies and conflicts resulting in
operational problems regarding NRHDC, PCGG and Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>,
who is perceived to be the controlling stockholder of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>company, entered into an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">agreement whereby 2/3 of the members of the Board of Directors of NRHDC
shall be nominees of the PCGG and 1/3 thereof shall be nominees of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 14, 1986, HIP and NRHDC, as sequestered by PCGG entered
into an agreement (addendum) extending the terms of their January 1, 1976
agreement thereof to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">an </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">indefinite period "on its existing terms
and conditions" with either party having the right to terminate the
agreement upon six (6) months prior written notice to the other party (pp. 6-7,
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1988</st1:date>,
NRHDC served upon HIP a letter advising that the management agreement shall be
terminated six (6) months from said date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was later learned that the letter termination was brought about by <span class="SpellE">NRDC's</span> decision to have New World Hotel Philippines (NWHP)
manage the property in lieu of HIP.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contending that there was breach of Article 18 of its original
management agreement with NRHDC, HIP initiated on November 2, 1988 an action
for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">intervention in <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
in Civil Case No. 0034/PCGG No. 34, a sequestration case, and wherein NRHDC was
included as among the firms sequestered, alleged to be part of the ill-gotten
wealth amassed by Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> in conspiracy
with former President Ferdinand Marcos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The proposed complaint-in-intervention attached to the
motion-in-intervention questions the termination of the management agreement
without the corresponding prior notice and/or right of first refusal under
Article 18 of the Agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
likewise prayed for recovery of unpaid management fees under the agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1988</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> issued the questioned Resolution
denying <span class="SpellE">HIP's</span> motion for intervention for lack of
jurisdiction since, "the presence of PCGG representatives in sequestered
companies does not automatical<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">ly</span>
tear down the corporate veil that distinguishes the corporation from its
officers, directors or stockholders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Corporate officials whether nominated by the PCGG or not, insofar as
third parties are concerned, are corporate officers."</p>

<p class="BODY">HIP has filed the present petition contending that, based on the
ruling <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of the Supreme Court in PCGG </span>v.
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, G.R. No. 7763, April 12, 1988 and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">PCGG </span>v. SEC, G.R. No. 82188, June 30,
1988 which held that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> has exclusive
and original jurisdiction over all cases civil or criminal, <u>and</u> <u>all</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">incidents</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <u>arising</u> <u>from,</u> <u>incidental</u>
<u>to,</u> <u>or</u> <u>related</u> </span><u>to</u>, such cases necessarily
fall likewise under the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span> exclusive and
original jurisdiction subject to review <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">on
</span><i>certiorari</i> exclusively by the Supreme Court (emphasis Ours).</p>

<p class="BODY">We issued a temporary restraining order on <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues in this case are:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. <span class="GramE">whether</span> petitioner has a legal
interest in Civil Case No. 0034, sufficient to justify its intervention
therein; and</p>

<p class="NUM">2. <span class="GramE">whether</span> the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
has jurisdiction over the subject matter of petitioner's proposed<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> complaint-in-intervention.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, petitioner has argued that:</p>

<blockquote>"As an incident of the case for recovery of ill-gotten wealth
filed by the Republic against Mr. Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
(Civil Case No. 0034) lodged before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">NRHDC which was alleged to be controlled
by the defendant thereat was placed under sequestration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As an incident of the sequestration of NRHDC,
PCGG nominees were able to constitute the majority in the Board of the
corporation such that for all practical intents and purposes, it ran the affairs
of the sequestered company as conservators of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among its corporate acts, is the <u>root</u>
of the present controversy wherein PCGG nominees have decided to terminate the
agreement between NRHDC and the <span class="GramE">petitioner.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Viewed in this light therefore, petitioner
stands to be adversely affected by the decision of the Board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> (p. 27, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its questioned Resolution, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The issue in the principal case into which <span class="SpellE">movant</span> Holiday Inn seeks to intervene refers to the <u>character</u>
of the properties subject matter thereof, including <st1:state><st1:place>RIVIERA</st1:place></st1:state>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether or not they were ‘ill-gotten’ or<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> ‘crony’ properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not, in the end, the position of
the Republic as plaintiff is upheld does not affect the rights of third persons
who deal with sequestered corporations.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2 of Rule 12 tells us that a person may intervene in
proceedings in progress if that person has a <u>legal</u> interest in the
success of either of the parties, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">against
both or when a disposition of the property involved would affect the
prospective <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Holiday Inn, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span>
has not shown how the termination or continuation of its management contract
would be <u>legally</u> affected by a finding of whether or not Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> lawfully acquired </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">RIVIERA</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Holiday Inn, Inc. tells the Court at argument that its
services to <st1:state><st1:place>RIVIERA</st1:place></st1:state> are<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"> </span>superior to that which might be
proposed by the prospective new management company, the New World Hotels
International, Ltd. of <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That may or may not be so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>fact</u> <u>is</u> <u>only</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Board</u> <u>of</u> <u>Directors</u> <u>of</u> <u>RIVIERA</u> <u>is</u> <u>qualified</u>
<u>to</u> <u>make</u> <u>that</u> <u>determination</u> <u>and,</u> <u>certainly,</u>
<u>not</u> <u>this</u> <u>Court</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
all events, even if New World is inferior to Holiday Inn, Inc., and its
management of <span class="SpellE">RIVIERA's</span> hotel might create less
gains, or even losses, that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">is </span>not
a legal interest that Holiday Inn, Inc. possesses in the main case of the
Republic against Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> nor is it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">a </span>fact that will justify intervention
herein." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">(pp. </span>186-187, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>; emphasis <span class="GramE">Ours</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the second issue, petitioner avers that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> has jurisdiction because, it claims that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the termination by Riviera of its management
contract </span>was upon a Board Resolution two thirds (2/3) of whose Board of
Directors are PCGG nominees; hence, the action to terminate the agreement
subject of the petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">bears the
imprimatur of the PCGG nominees sitting thereat, making the PCGG the real
party-in-interest in </span>the present controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> believes otherwise:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court
is of the view that its jurisdiction refers to acts of the PCGG acting <u>as</u>
<u>such</u> whether alone or with other persons, natural or juridical, and not
generally where PCGG representatives act as part of another juridical person or
entity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A rule of thumb might be
thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>if the PCGG can be properly <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> on a cause of action asserted before this Court
as a distinct entity, then this Court would generally exercise jurisdiction;
otherwise, it would not, because, then the 'PCGG character' of the act or
omission in question may, at best, be only incidental.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>all, the presence
of PCGG representatives in sequestered companies does not automatically tear
down the corporate veil that distinguishes the corporation from its officers,
directors or stockholders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Corporate
officers whether nominated by the PCGG or not act, insofar as third parties are
concerned, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">are </span>corporate
officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contracts entered into by the
San Miguel Corporation, for example, in connection with its poultry operations
and the cancellations thereof, are not PCGG activities which would justify the
invocation of this Court's jurisdiction, even if the contract or the suit were
unanimously approved by its board of directors where PCGG representatives
sit." (Resolution, Annex 'O,' p. 143, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In both instances, <span class="GramE">We</span> agree with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject-matter of petitioner's proposed
complaint-in-intervention involves <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">basically</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">, </span>an interpretation of contract, i.e.,
whether or not the right of first refusal could and/or should have been observed,
based on the Addendum/Agreement of July 14, 1988, which extended the terms and
conditions of the original agreement of January 1, 1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question of whether or not the
sequestered property was lawfully <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">acquired
by Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> has no bearing on the
legality of the termination of the management contract by <span class="SpellE">NRHDC's</span>
Board of Directors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two are
independent and unrelated issues and resolution of either may proceed
independently of each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upholding
the legality of <span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> acquisition of the
sequestered property </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not a guarantee that HIP'S management
contract would be upheld, for only the Board of Directors of NRHDC is qualified
to make such a determination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> correctly
denied jurisdiction over the proposed complaint-in?intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original and exclusive jurisdiction given
to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> over PCGG cases pertains to a) <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">cases</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt"> <u>filed</u> <u>by</u> </span><u>the</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">PCGG</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">, </span>pursuant
to the exercise of its powers under Executive Order Nos. 1, 2 and 14, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">amended by the Office of the President, and
Article XVIII, Section 26 of the Constitution, i.e. where the </span>principal
cause of action <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>the recovery
of ill-gotten wealth, as well as all incidents arising from, incidental to, or <u>related</u>
<u>to</u> <u>such</u> <u>cases</u> and b) <u>cases</u> <u>filed</u> <u>by</u> <u>those</u>
<u>who</u> <u>wish</u> <u>to</u> <u>question</u> <u>or</u> <u>challenge</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Commission's</u> <u>acts</u> <u>or</u> <u>orders</u> <u>in</u> <u>such</u> <u>cases</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Evidently, petitioner's
proposed complaint-in?</span>intervention is an ordinary civil case that
does not pertain to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Solicitor General stated, the complaint
is not directed against PCGG as an entity, but against a private corporation,
in which case it is not <u>per</u> <u>se</u>, a PCGG case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DISMISSED and the ruling of
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> denying the motion to intervene, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>hereby upheld.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The temporary restraining order issued on <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="11">November <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">16,

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR. <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I respectfully dissent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
this Court does not want to decide the simple question of the right of first
refusal found in the 1976 management contract as extended by the 1986 addendum,
the least we can do is to require the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
to resolve this issue before it tackles the main issue as to the true ownership
of Holiday Inn Hotel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Through this decision, we are inviting a multiplicity of suits -
(1) the ill gotten wealth case now before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
(2) the dispute as to who shall manage and run the sequestered property to
insure that it is not dissipated before final turnover to the <span class="SpellE">Benedictos</span> or to the Government (which, under this
decision, we say is for the regular courts and not the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>),
and (3) the inevitable appeal to us or the interpretation of the management
contract and later the ownership issue in the sequestration case, assuming<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the hotel still exists once the decision on
the management question is implemented.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the agreement between PCGG and Mr. Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, <u>two-thirds</u> of the members of the Holiday
Inn Board are PCGG nominees and one third <span class="GramE">are</span> <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> nominees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the decision to terminate Holiday Inn's contract was made, this
was, therefore, a PCGG decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I find
it strange why the legality of that PCGG action and the authority of Holiday
Inn (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
to enforce a clause on its right of first refusal should be outside of the
jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There would have been no termination of the contract
which was acceptable to the parties since 1976, if PCGG did not take over the
control and effective ownership of the business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without a sequestration order, not a single
PCGG official would be sitting in the hotel board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There would have been no PCGG dominated Board
deciding to terminate the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, any decision to end the management contract and to have the
hotel managed by <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> chosen people is simply an
incident of the exercise of the power to sequester. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Only the Supreme Court or the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> who are familiar with the record of PCGG in
managing sequestered companies and who can immediately act on motions involving
the life and health of these companies should decide the issue on the
management of the hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our earlier
experience with cases involving Holiday Inn and its fiscal agents confirms my
dim views on the ability of Government in general and PCGG in particular to run
sequestered firms with the diligence of a real owner.</p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore, emphasize that PCGG, the <span class="SpellE">sequestrator</span>,
has taken over Holiday Inn hotel as its effective administrator with the powers
of an owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any challenge to its acts
must be taken before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and eventually
to us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Court's decision in <u>PCGG</u> <u>v.</u> <u>PEÑA</u>,
159 SCRA 556 (1988), it is not only the PCGG cases involving the illegal wealth
of Mr. Marcos, his family, and cronies which come under the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span>
exclusive jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court also
included "all incidents arising from, incidental to or related to such
cases." I dissented in <span class="SpellE"><u>Peña</u></span> and urged
that certain cases such as the efforts of victims, whose properties were taken
over by Marcos cronies, to recover their properties, cases which have nothing
to do with cronyism or illegal acquisition of wealth, and cases of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, unpaid rents, etc. should go to regular
courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I was overruled by the
majority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his "addendum",
the <span class="SpellE">ponente</span> - then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
- stated that jurisdiction cannot be split; every issue involving sequestered
property and its management and disposition must go to <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now have before us an issue that is of paramount importance in
the way sequestered property shall be administered and operated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the Court does not want to allow the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> who has been operating the hotel since 1976 to
come before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">I believe the better procedure is for us to decide the issue
which led to this petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Everything
needed for a decision is in the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The issue will come to us again in the future if we do not settle it
now.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But if we opt not to do so, then
the issue must be decided by <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is part and parcel of the sequestration
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should not be split from the
main case.</p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore, vote to GRANT the petition and to ORDER the <span class="SpellE">Sanbiganbayan</span> to allow the petitioner to intervene in the
main case.</p>
