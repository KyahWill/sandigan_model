<span class="SpellE">Montante</span>, Jr., (16 years old), Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Montante</span> (15 years old), and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Montante</span>

(TSN, December 16, 1981, pp. 3-4; TSN January 30, 1982, p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lea's grandmother and her half brother Billy,
who were there for the wake and burial of Lea's mother, were sleeping in another
room (TSN, February 16, 1982, p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lea
was then only eleven (11) years old having been born on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1968</st1:date> (TSN, January 20, 1982, p.

her (TSN, December 16, 1981, p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lea
struggled and tried to stop him but appellant succeeded in placing his private
parts into Lea's private parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rape
lasted for ten minutes.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

also around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> the appellant
again raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incident was
witnessed by Lea's younger brother, Cesar <span class="SpellE">Montante</span>,
then only nine (9) years old, who was sleeping a little further from the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Lea <span style="">did </span>not talk to him as she was ashamed (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>

</span></span>Lea's attempt to run away from home was thwarted by the appellant

sleeping together with her three brothers, (Id., p. 13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00</st1:time>
in the evening, appellant covered Lea's mouth and proceeded to rape her for
about fifteen (15) minutes (Id., pp. 13-14).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her brothers were asleep throughout the incident (Id., pp. 14-15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day Lea could no longer keep
the matter to herself and told her brothers about how their father raped her
and to tell their neighbors about it (Id., p. 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lea and her brothers were able to tell their
neighbors including one Lydia <span class="SpellE">Labosta</span> and one <span class="SpellE">Felicing</span>, the latter being a friend of their mother (Id.,
p. 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all advised Lea to run away
(Id., pp. 15-16).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lea was able to run away to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city> to work as a maid for a
certain Josie (Id., pp. 17).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After two

<blockquote>Accused denies having ever raped his daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He theorizes that his daughter is falsely
charging him with the offense because of his having repeatedly berated her for
constant (sic) going out with her gang which would at times have her spend the
night outside the family abode.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
particularly remembers that the last time she returned home after an
unauthorized absence, he meted out a corporal punishment to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He spanked her while she was lying vertically
on the floor with her head on it and her feet up on air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl almost died (TSN, 27 July 1987, pp.
2-6; TSN, 29 July 1987, p. 10).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

could not have raped Lea on <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="9">29
 September 1978</st1:date> because it was only two days after the interment of
his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, his
mother-in-law and the twenty-sevenÂ­-year-old son of his wife from a former
marriage were staying in their house where the alleged rape was supposed to
have been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, he
slept at the ground floor of the house while their two aforementioned guests
slept in the same place with all his four older children, under a single
mosquito net.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the third night of
the nine nights of prayer for his departed wife (TSN, 27 July 1987, pp. 3-6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="12">24 December 1978</st1:date>, the accused was in
the house of his neighbor with his fourth child Cesar, waiting for his three
older children (<span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> Jr., Leonardo, and Lea) who
heard mass at the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Catholic Church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the former went home at <st1:time minute="10" hour="13">1:10 o'clock</st1:time> at dawn of <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="12">25 December 1978</st1:date>, his three children were

four children went visiting with relatives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused was left alone at home (TSN, 29 July 1987, pp. 2-5).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he woke up at dawn, as was
his wont as a fisherman, his daughter Lea was still sleeping beside her

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the appellant interposes the lone assignment of
error,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
to wit:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE
ACCUSED ON THE SOLE BASIS OF THE COMPLAINING WITNESS' INCONGRUOUS TESTIMONY
WHICH FALLS SHORT OF THE QUANTUM OF PROOF REQUIREMENT IN CRIMINAL CASES.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We must point out at the very outset that in our appreciation of
the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the defense, we are always
guided by the principle that "rape is an accusation easy to make, hard to
prove, but more difficult for the party accused, though innocent, to
defend."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the caveat that the testimony of the injured female should not be
received with precipitate credulity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More so when the conviction depends at any vital point upon her
uncorroborated testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court therefore takes on the painstaking task of scrutinizing
in great detail the record of the case in order to ascertain whether or not the
quantum of proof necessary to overcome the presumption of innocence and
establish the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt has been clearly
demonstrated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>After a<i> </i>careful
review of the entire record, we find sufficient evidence pointing to the guilt
of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We therefore see no cogent reason to disturb the findings of the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well-settled is the rule, which is applicable in this case, that
appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings <span style="">of </span>the trial court on the issue of
credibility of witnesses, unless certain facts of substance and value have
clearly and plainly been overlooked or neglected and that, if considered, might
affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, conviction by the trial court of the accused in rape cases based on the
sole testimony of the offended party has, in quite a number of instances, been
sustained by us on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant, however, argues that the foregoing rule is not
applicable in this case on the ground that another judge, other than Judge <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, the one who
penned the decision, presided when the com<span style="">p</span>lainin<span style="">g</span> witness gave her testimony, citing
People v. Escalante, 131 S<span style="">CRA </span>237,
and that therefore the latter judge was not in a position to decide on the
credibility <span style="">of the </span>private
complainant's testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as
correctly pointed out in the brief for the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
"the a<span style="">pp</span>ellant conveniently
fails <span style="">to </span>state that, unlike the
Escalante case where the trial judge did not try <span style="">any </span>part of the case at all and relied solely on the records, in
the case at bar, Judge <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
was the presiding judge during the latter half of the trial of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She started presiding when i<span style="">t </span>was the defense's turn to present
evidence and during the prosecution's rebuttal."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">athough</span> another judge other
than Judge <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
was present at the hearing of the complaining witness, there are however
attendant circumstances other than the demeanor of the said witness in court
which convincingly establish the "believability" of her
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said chain of
circumstances as succinctly put by the <span style="">Solicitor
G</span>eneral, reads thus:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>First, the complaining witness, Lea <span class="SpellE">Montante</span>,
was barely fourteen (14) years old when she testified on <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a tender age of the victim lends
credibility to her testimony (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Egot</span>, 130
SCRA 134).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is difficult to believe
that she could deliberately perjure herself and fabricate such a detailed
testimony.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second, it can be immediately gleaned from the transcript of
stenographic notes (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>) that Lea <span class="SpellE">Montante's</span>
testimony is replete with details including that of the sexual act (such as the
sucking and fondling of the female breast, secretion from the male organ, and
the significance of menstruation subsequent to sexual intercourse) not normally
within the knowledge and imagination of a girl who is barely fourteen years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The detailed narration of the victim, a young
girl, of how she was repeatedly raped by her father is worthy of credence
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">MuÃ±oz</span>, 101 SCRA 704; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Baao</span>, 142 SCRA 476).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Third, the appellant is the complainant's own flesh and blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant correctly points out that only
a father of warped moral values can <span style="">engage
in carnal relations with his own child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But by the same token, it is unimaginable that a 14â€“year old daughter
would charge her own father with rape unless the same is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It requires guile and craft to charge one's
father with rape (People vs. <span class="SpellE">MuÃ±oz</span>, 101 SCRA
704).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense never adduced evidence
to show that Lea <span class="SpellE">Montante</span>, at her age, was possessed
of guile and craft characteristic of scheming adult women of loose morals.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fourth, the charge of rape is inherently, socially and emotionally
destructive of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
difficult to believe that a chaste woman, much less a young girl, would go
through the troubles and humiliation of a<i> </i>medical examination and a rape
trial <span style="">unless the rape charge is true </span><span style="">(People </span><span style="">vs. <span class="SpellE">Cam<span style="">p</span>esino</span>,
</span>143 SCRA 56), <span style="">more so if it is
one against her own father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
attendant publicity, humiliation, and personal anguish that a rape trial
necessarily entails deter most rape victims from seeking legal redress.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant alleges that in charging him with rape, the complainant
was merely seeking revenge for the corporeal punishment he inflicted on her as
a disciplinary measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> correctly held
that this is "flimsy and untenable".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant could have charged her father with any other crime which
would have been just as effective in putting him away to prison but surely not
rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rape charge would also destroy
her with a stigma that will haunt her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can only be one rational explanation why she had to charge her
father with rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It really did
happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for three times.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Fifth, the complaining witness submitted herself willingly to a
medical examination where she was undressed and her private parts scrutinized
by a male doctor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">wilingness</span> of a rape victim to submit to medical
examination is eloquent testimony of the truth of the charge (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Clarin</span>, 108 SCRA 680).<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides the simple denial, the <span style="">appellant </span>asserts that the charges against him were fabricated at
the instance of the aunt of the private complainant who, purportedly though h<span style="">er nephew, visited the appellant in jail and
demanded P5,000.00 in exchange for the dropping of the case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But upon cross-examination of the said aunt

<p class="BODY">Finally, the appellant alleges inconsistencies in the evidence
for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In particular, the
appellant assails the testimony of the private complainant where she indicated
that she and her father were alone in the house during the first alleged rape
on <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the said
allegation was highly improbable inasmuch as the said date was the second day
of the nine-day novena for her deceased mother and that aside from her
brothers, her grandmother and a half brother <span style="">were<b> </b></span>in their house as guests.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>said alleged
inconsistency is however belied by the evidence on record which shows that the
private complainant positively stated that on the first alleged rape, her
grandmother and half brother were sleeping in another room inside their house
six meters from the room where she and her brothers were sleeping.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The appellant likewise assumes without any supporting evidence that the novena
stretched until <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> when the
first alleged rape took place.</p>

<p class="BODY">On another aspect, the appellant makes much of the
"stoicism" shown by the private complainant when the following day
after the alleged incidents of rape, she refused to tell anybody, not even her
grandmother or her brothers when she had the opportunity to do so,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
but that she merely cleaned the house immediately thereafter and went to
school.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But the trial court, in correctly interpreting the said acts of
the private complainant, stated, thus:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In fact, Lea even testified that she kept to herself what happened
to her on the first and second occasions because she was ashamed for others to
know it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on the third
occasion that she had the courage to reveal to her brothers, who were also
minors like her, as to what their father did to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was thru the advice of a neighbor and a
friend of her mother that she was able to collect herself and finally run away
from home which she failed to do before because of the threat on her life by
her father<span style="font-size: 12pt;">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Lea preferred to keep to herself her sad and embarrassing
experience as she could not even face her brother, Cesar, who saw what her
father did to her on <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="12">December 24,
 1978</st1:date> when he was awakened from his sleep (page 11, TSN of <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1981</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These acts of the complainant convincingly
show that she is a typical Filipina girl who is ashamed to let the public know
that she was molested and sexually abused, more so by her own father.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In any case, whatever inconsistencies there are refer only to

On the contrary, minor discrepancies in the testimonies of two or more witnesses
are but natural and would even enhance their credibility as w<span style="">i</span>tnesses, because these indicate that

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">bottomline</span> is that the simple
denial and flimsy defense of the father uncorroborated by any other witness can
not prevail over the straightforward and unequivocal testimony of his teen-age
daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is most ironic that at the
very moment when the young girl needed greater love and care upon the loss of her
mother, her father instead inflicted upon her this tragic fate that is often
times worse than death itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She must
have wished rather that she had joined her departed mother.</p>
