				<BR><BR><p align="justify">This is a petition for review on <em>certiorari</em> of the 
decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of the Court of Appeals dated 
May 4, 1971 in CA-G.R. No. 34832-R entitled <em>Dra. Sofia L. Prudenciado v. 
Alliance Transport System, Inc. and Jose Leyson</em>, which modified the 
decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of the Court of First 
Instance of Rizal, Quezon City, in Civil Case No. Q-5235 reducing the amount of 
moral damages from P25,000 to P2,000 and eliminating the award of exemplary 
damages and attorney's fees but granting actual damages of P2,451.27.<br><br>The 
decretal portion of said decision reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby modified, 
ordering appellants jointly and severally to pay plaintiff the sum of P2,451.27 
for actual damages representing the cost of the repair of the car of Plaintiff; 
(2) the sum of P2,000.00 as moral damages.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to 
costs."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The antecedent facts of this case as found by the trial court 
and by the Court of Appeals are as follows:<br><br>At about 2:05 p.m. of May 11, 
1960, Dra. Sofia L. Prudenciado was driving her own Chevrolet Bel Air car along 
Arroceros Street with the intention of crossing Taft Avenue in order to turn 
left, to go to the Philippine Normal College Compound where she would hold 
classes.&nbsp; She claimed that she was driving her car at the rate of 10 kmph; that 
before crossing Taft Ave. she stopped her car and looked to the right and to the 
left and not noticing any on-coming vehicle on either side she slowly proceeded 
on first gear to cross the same, but when she was almost at the center, near the 
island thereof, Jose Leyson who was driving People's Taxicab owned and operated 
by Alliance Transport System, Inc., suddenly bumped and struck Dra. 
Prudenciado's car, thereby causing physical injuries in different parts of her 
body, suffering more particularly brain concussion which subjected her to 
several physical examinations and to an encephalograph test while her car was 
damaged to the extent of P2,451.27.&nbsp; The damage to the taxicab amounted to 
P190.00 (Decision in Civil Case No. Q-5235, CFI, Rizal; Record on Appeal, pp. 
63-64; Decision, CA-G.R. No. 34832-R, <em>Rollo</em>, pp. 37-38).<br><br>Dra. 
Prudenciado filed a complaint for damages at the Court of First Instance of 
Rizal, Quezon City against the Alliance Transport System and Jose Leyson 
docketed as aforestated, Civil Case No. Q-5232 (Record on Appeal, pp. 
2-11).<br><br>After due hearing, the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Quezon 
City, found Jose Leyson guilty of negligence in the performance of his duties as 
taxicab driver which is the proximate cause of the accident in question.&nbsp; On the 
other hand, defendant Alliance Transport System, Inc. failed to prove to the 
satisfaction of the court that it had exercised the required diligence of a good 
father of the family in the selection, supervision and control of its employees 
including defendant Leyson.&nbsp; Consequently, both defendants were held jointly and 
severally liable for the physical injuries suffered by the plaintiff Dra. Sofia 
L. Prudenciado as well as for the damage to her car, in addition to the other 
consequential damages prayed for.<br><br>The dispositive portion of said 
decision reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS judgment is rendered, 
one in favor of plaintiff and against the defendants, by ordering the said 
defendants, jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiff the sum of P2,451.27 for 
actual damages representing the cost for the repair of the car of plaintiff; 
P25,000.00 as moral damages; P5,000.00 as exemplary damages; and the further sum 
of P3,000.00 as attorney's fees, with costs against the defendants." (Record on 
Appeal, pp. 71-73).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">On appeal, the Court of Appeals rendered the assailed decision 
on May 14, 1971 and denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration in its 
resolution dated July 20, 1971.<br><br>Hence, this petition.<br><br>The petition 
was given due course in the resolution of this Court dated September 6, 1971 and 
petitioner filed her brief on November 10, 1971 (<em>Rollo</em>, p. 69) while 
respondents filed their brief on January 24, 1972 (<em>Rollo</em>, p. 86).&nbsp; 
Petitioner filed her Reply Brief on March 1, 1972 (<em>Rollo</em>, p. 96); after 
which the case was considered submitted for decision on the same date 
(<em>Rollo</em>, p. 99).<br><br>In her brief, petitioner raised the following 
assignment of errors:</p>

<p align="center">VIII </p>
<p align="justify">THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN MODIFYING THE DECISION 
OF THE TRIAL COURT NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT THE DECISION OF SAID TRIAL 
COURT IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The Court of Appeals and the trial court are in accord in the 
finding that the accident was caused by the negligence of the taxi driver. The 
bone of contention is however in the award of damages, which crystalizes the 
errors assigned into one main issue, which is whether or not the Court of 
Appeals is justified in modifying or changing the grant of damages by the trial 
court.<br><br>It is well settled that factual findings of the Court of Appeals 
are binding on the Supreme Court, but said findings are subject to scrutiny if 
such are diametrically opposed to those of the trial court (<em>Samson v. CA, et 
al.</em>, G.R. No. L-40071, January 29, 1986).<br><br>The Court of Appeals 
concedes that a concussion of the brain was suffered by Dra. Prudenciado but as 
to how serious was the concussion or how it had later become, and the disastrous 
extent of the injuries which she alleges to have sustained as a result of the 
accident, are seriously doubted by said Appellate Court.<br><br>Specifically, 
said Court finds that Dra. Prudenciado's claim (which was sustained by the trial 
court) that because of aforesaid concussion, she eventually lost her usual 
liveliness, vivacity, activity and her usual self-confidence, to the extent that 
now she feels uncertain and insecure, not to mention a sense of extreme fright 
and serious anxiety, serious apprehension of losing her life, or her senses or 
reason or her physical mobility momentarily, plus experiences of great shock and 
severe pains on her back near the left side of her spinal column in the lumbar 
region, was not supported by the deposition of Dr. Conrado Aramil, the 
specialist who attended to the plaintiff from May 14 to May 26, 1960 (TSN, July 
13, 1960, pp. 72-73).&nbsp; From said deposition, it was gathered that Dra. 
Prudenciado suffered a mild abnormality, compatible with mild concussion of the 
brain (TSN, July 13, 1960, pp. 47-48); that the symptoms of any brain concussion 
usually are headache, dizziness, vomiting and lack of pep or alertness; and that 
the possible after effects that may be produced are persistent or irregular 
headaches, fluctuating dizziness.&nbsp; Accordingly, Dra. Prudenciado was advised 
"Just to watch herself if she would develop any alarming symptoms such as 
headache, dizziness or vomitings, to have her rechecked after several months for 
her to be sure." (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 51-52).&nbsp; It might also produce 
intellectual deterioration or lessening of intelligence, and even 
insanity.<br><br>Dra. Prudenciado sought to establish that she had precisely 
suffered all those after effects except insanity; but the Court of Appeals ruled 
that her proof consisted merely in her own uncorroborated testimony.&nbsp; In support 
of her allegation she could not show any medical certificate tending to prove 
that she was indeed medically treated abroad for her brain ailment nor was there 
any showing in the documents presented that she was demoted to the rank of 
technical assistant because the San Francisco State College does not believe in 
her mental capacity any more.<br><br>Finally, her statements that she is almost 
completely losing her voice, that she has a terrible headache when her head is 
pressed, that she has lost her sense of taste, that she is nervous and 
temperamental and that she has lapses of memory, are belied by the deposition of 
Dr. Aramil that the patient's EEG was already normal on May 26, 1960; and on 
cross-examination he declared that she was clinically symtomless when she was 
discharged from the hospital (TSN, July 13, 1960, pp. 75-76; 
78-79).<br><br>There is no argument that moral damages include physical 
suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, 
wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and similar injury.&nbsp; Though 
incapable of pecuniary computation, moral damages may be recovered if they are 
the proximate result of defendant's wrongful act or omission (People v. Baylon, 
129 SCRA 62 [1984]).<br><br>In the same manner, it is undisputed that the trial 
courts are given discretion to determine the amount of moral damages 
(<em>Alcantara v. Surro</em>, 93 Phil. 472) and that the Court of Appeals can 
only modify or change the amount awarded when they are palpably and scandalously 
excessive "so as to indicate that it was the result of passion, prejudice or 
corruption on the part of the trial court (<em>Gellada v. Warner Barnes &amp; 
Co., Inc.</em>, 57 O.G. (4) 7347, 7358; <em>Sadie v. Bachrach Motors Co., 
Inc.</em>, 57 O.G. (4) 636 and <em>Adone v. Bachrach Motor Co., Inc.</em>, 57 
O.G. 656).&nbsp; But in more recent cases where the awards of moral and exemplary 
damages are far too excessive compared to the actual losses sustained by the 
aggrieved party, this Court ruled that they should be reduced to more reasonable 
amounts.<br><br>Thus, in the case of <em>San Andres v. Court of Appeals</em> 
(116 SCRA 85 [1982]) the Supreme Court ruled that while the amount of moral 
damages is a matter left largely to the sound discretion of a court, the same 
when found excessive should be reduced to more reasonable amounts, considering 
the attendant facts and circumstances.&nbsp; Moral damages, though incapable of 
pecuniary estimation, are in the category of an award designed to compensate the 
claimant for actual injury suffered and not to impose a penalty on the 
wrongdoer.<br><br>In a much later case (<em>Siguenza v. Court of Appeals</em>, 
137 SCRA 578-579 [1985]), the Supreme Court, reiterating the above ruling, 
reduced the awards of moral and exemplary damages which were far too excessive 
compared to the actual losses sustained by the aggrieved parties and where the 
records show that the injury suffered was not serious or gross and, therefore, 
out of proportion to the amount of damages generously awarded by the trial 
court.<br><br>In any case the Court held that "moral damages are emphatically 
not intended to enrich a complainant at the expense of a defendant.&nbsp; They are 
awarded only to enable the injured party to obtain means, diversion or 
amusements that will serve to alleviate the moral suffering he has undergone, by 
reason of the defendants' culpable action." The award of moral damages must be 
proportionate to the suffering inflicted (<em>R &amp; B Surety &amp; Insurance 
Co., Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court</em>, 129 SCRA 745 [1984] citing 
<em>Grand Union Supermarket, Inc. v. Espino, Jr.</em>, 94 SCRA 
966).<br><br>Coming back to the case at bar, a careful review of the records 
makes it readily apparent that the injuries sustained by Dra. Prudenciado are 
not as serious or extensive as they were claimed to be, to warrant the damages 
awarded by the trial court.&nbsp; In fact, a closer scrutiny of the exhibits showing 
a moderate damage to the car can by no stretch of the imagination produce a 
logical conclusion that such disastrous effects of the accident sought to be 
established, actually took place, not to mention the fact that such were not 
supported by the medical findings presented.&nbsp; Unquestionably, therefore, the 
damages imposed by the lower court should be reduced to more reasonable 
levels.<br><br>On the other hand, it will be observed that the reduction of the 
damages made by the Court of Appeals is both too drastic and unrealistic, to 
pass the test of reasonableness, which appears to be the underlying basis to 
justify such reduction.<br><br>While the damages sought to be recovered were not 
satisfactorily established to the extent desired by the petitioner, it was 
nonetheless not disputed that an accident occurred due to the fault and 
negligence of the respondents; that Dra. Prudenciado suffered a brain concussion 
which although mild, can admittedly produce the effects complained of by her and 
that these symptoms can develop after several years and can lead to some serious 
handicaps or predispose the patient to other sickness (TSN, July 13, 1960, pp. 
52-54).&nbsp; Being a doctor by profession, her fears can be more real and intense 
than an ordinary person.&nbsp; Otherwise stated, she is undeniably a proper recipient 
of moral damages which are proportionate to her suffering.<br><br>As to 
exemplary damages, Article 2231 of the Civil Code provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In <em>quasi-delicts</em>, exemplary damages may be granted if 
the defendant acted with grave negligence." </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The rationale behind exemplary or corrective damages is, as the 
name implies, to provide an example or correction for the public good 
(<em>Lopez, et al. v. Pan American World Airways</em>, 16 SCRA 431). The 
findings of the trial court in the case at bar which became the basis of the 
award of exemplary damages are to the effect that it is more apparent from the 
facts, conditions and circumstances obtaining in the record of the case that 
respondent driver was running at high speed after turning to the right along 
Taft Ave. coming from Ayala Boulevard, considering that the traffic was clear.&nbsp; 
Failing to notice petitioner's car, he failed to apply his brakes and did not 
even swerve to the right to avoid the collision (Record on Appeal, pp. 
69-70).<br><br>The Court of Appeals conforms with aforesaid findings of the 
trial court but is not prepared to accept that there was gross negligence on the 
part of the driver to justify the imposition of exemplary 
damages.<br><br>However, a driver running at full speed on a rainy day, on a 
slippery road in complete disregard of the hazards to life and limb of other 
people cannot be said to be acting in anything less than gross negligence.&nbsp; The 
frequent incidence of accidents of this nature caused by taxi drivers indeed 
demands corrective measures.<br><br><strong>PREMISES CONSIDERED</strong>, the 
assailed decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby MODIFIED insofar as the 
award of damages is concerned; and respondents are ordered to jointly and 
severally pay the petitioner; (1) the sum of P2,451.27 for actual damages 
representing the cost of the repair of her car; (2) the sum of P15,000.00 as 
moral damages; (3) the sum of P5,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (4) the sum of 
P3,000.00 as attorney's fees.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><strong>SO 
ORDERED</strong>.</p>
