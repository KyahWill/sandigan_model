				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with preliminary injunction to set aside the Order dated </span><st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="12"><span style="">December
 21, 1967</span></st1:date><span style=""> in Civil
Case No. 62320 of the Court of First Instance of Manila which cancelled the
notice of <u>lis</u> <u>pendens</u> annotated on the titles covering three
parcels of land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners-plaintiffs
filed an amended complaint praying, among other things, for the annulment of a
"Deed of Absolute Sale" covering the said three parcels of land
allegedly executed on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="22" month="7"><span style="">July 22, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> by their mother, Hilaria Isabelo Vda. de
Tankeh, in favor of their brother, respondent Clemente Tankeh and his wife, who
caused its execution without giving any price or consideration therefor, and eventually
obtaining new registered titles in their names.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="3"><span style="">March 2, </span><span style="">1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">Hilaria Isabelo Vda. de Tankeh died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To protect their rights over the subject pro­perties as compulsory heirs
of the deceased, petitioners caused a notice of <u>lis</u> </span><u><span style="">pendens</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">to be annotated on the
corresponding titles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="12"><span style="">December
 21, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
Judge ordered the cancellation of the notice of <u>lis</u> </span><u><span style="">pendens</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">upon private
respondents' filing of a bond in the amount of P100,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners filed the
instant petition claiming that respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of
discre­tion because said notice was necessary to protect their rights </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the event of any intended alienation of the properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents, however, argue
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) petitioners' claim that they
have no motive to molest them is self-serving; and (b) the sufficient bond
filed by them (private respondents) renders the notice of </span><u><span style="">lis</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">pendens</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">unnecessary
to protect petitioners' rights, if</span><span style="">
any</span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="1"><span style="">January </span><span style="">29, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">the Supreme Court enjoined the respondents from enforcing the assailed
order can­celling the notice of <u>lis</u> </span><u><span style="">pendens</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Later, petitioner Remigio
Tan died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His heirs substituted him as
plaintiffs in the said civil case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, due to oversight, no formal substitution was made in the
present petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October </span><span style="">15, 1979, </span><span style="">respondent court rendered its decision dismissing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision is now pending appeal before the
Intermediate Appellate Court (formerly, the Court of Appeals).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Doctrine of <u>Lis</u>
</span><u><span style="">Pendens</span></u><span style=""> is founded upon reasons of public policy and
necessity, the purpose of which is to keep the properties in litigation within
the power of the court until the litigation is terminated, and to prevent the
defeat of the judgment or decree by subsequent alienation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This purpose would be rendered meaningless if
private respondents are allowed to file a bond, regard­less of the amount, in
substitution of said notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the law does not authorize a judge to cancel a notice of </span><u><span style="">lis</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">pendens</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">pending
litigation, upon the mere filing of a sufficient bond by the party on whose
title said notice is annotated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 24, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court expressly provides that
courts can cancel a notice of <u>lis</u> <u>pendens</u> only on two
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) after a proper showing that
the notice is for the purpose of molesting the adverse party; or (b) it is not
necessary to protect the interest of the party who caused it to be
recorded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, respondent
spouses themselves manifested their intent to temporarily encumber subject
properties as security for a loan required for their business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(p. </span>4,
Rollo) Consequently, annotation of the notice of <u>lis</u> <u><span style="">pendens</span></u> is essential, considering
that petitioners intend to preserve subject properties for sentimental reasons,
in case they are adjudged the lawful owners thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the assailed order directing the can­cellation
of the notice of <u>lis</u> <u><span style="">pendens</span></u>
is hereby ANNULED or SET ASIDE and the writ of preliminary injunction is hereby
declared permanent.</p>
