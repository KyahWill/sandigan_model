				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, <i>Mandamus</i> and
Prohibition seeks to annul the Order issued by the Honorable Buenaventura J.
Guerrero, presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court, Makati, Branch 133,
dated April 2, 1991 granting the preliminary injunction enjoining petitioners
from enforcing a writ of execution issued by the Honorable Salvador S. Tensuan,
presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court, Makati, Branch 146, pursuant to
the judgment in Civil Case No. 88-2648.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners raise the following questions for resolution by
this Court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  May Branch 133, Regional Trial Court-Makati
presided by respondent Judge, restrain and enjoin, by injunction, the execution
of final and executory judgment of Branch 146, Regional Trial Court-Makati?</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  May persons found by Branch 146, Regional
Trial Court-Makati to have moneys due and owing to a judgment debtor file a
separate action for "Damages with Preliminary Injunction" before a
different, co-equal and coordinate Branch 133, Regional Trial Court-Makati, and
may the latter court consider and resolve the issue of whether or not said
persons have moneys due to the judgment debtor, and upon its own finding that
no such moneys are due, enjoin the enforcement of the writ of execution issued
by the first court?</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  May affidavits and receipts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pre­</span>sented by stockholders as proof of
full payment of subscription to the capital stock of a corporation pre­vail and
override official records certified by the Securities and Ex­change Commission
showing the un­paid subscriptions of stockholders?</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  In fine, and in order not to render
ineffective the provisions of Sec­tions 39, 40, 41, 42 and 45 Rule 39, Revised
Rules of Court, on execution proceedings directed against or involving property
of persons not party to the case but having credits due to the judgment debtor,
is it not appropriate, equitable and justified that the cumulative remedies
available to third party claimants under Section 17, Rule 39, Revised Rules of
Court, be deemed limited to cases of "wrong­ful levy" when properties
of third persons not party to the case were mistakenly levied as property of
the judgment debtor, while those cases where the court that rendered judgment
actually and knowingly di­rects process like execution, gar­nishment or such
orders upon third persons not party to a case, relief and remedy must be sought
only from the same court or to a superior court and not with any coordinate or
co-equal court?"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Masterbuilt Industries, Inc. (MII, for short), a
manufacturer of ZEBRA brand of utility motor vehicles, obtained judgment in
Civil Case No. 88-2648 for "Replevin or Damages" in its favor and
against Master Ace <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sales </span>and
Development, Inc. (MASD, for short), before the Regional Trial Court, Makati,
Branch 146.  In this judgment, MASD was
ordered to pay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">MII </span>in the
principal sum of P983,000.00, representing the purchase price of five (5) units
of utility motor vehicles delivered to MASD by MII, as one of its dealers.  After this judgment became final, MII moved
for the issuance of the writ of execution, which<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span>the court did, directing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">herein petitioner, </span>Cristobal Jabson,
the deputy sheriff, to implement the judgment.  Upon Sheriff's Return showing that the writ of execution was
unsatisfied, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>defendant MASD
had already moved out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>its
address, without leaving any forwarding address and upon verification with the
Securities and Exchange Commission showing that certain incorporators had
remaining balances or unpaid subscriptions, MII moved for the issuance of an
Alias Writ of Execution praying that judgment be enforced against the funds,
goods and chattels of defendants MASD and goods of its incorporators only up to
the extent of their unpaid subscriptions, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">alias </span>writ which Sheriff Jabson intended to implement upon the
funds of herein private respondents which gave rise to the action for
injunction filed by them with respondent RTC-Makati, Branch 133.  In this civil case, the presiding judge
issued an order granting preliminary injunction and later denied MII's motion
to reconsider said order.  Hence this
petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">discussing </span>the
issues raised by the petitioners, We find it important to lay down the basic
principles regarding the remedy herein involved.  It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>very
essential to note that the writ of <i>certiorari</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is </span>proper to correct errors of jurisdiction committed by the
lower court, or grave abuse of discretion which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">To the query of whether or not the RTC-Makati, Branch 133 may
restrain and enjoin the execution of a final and executory judgment of
RTC-Makati, Branch 146.  We answer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the action filed by private respondents
herein, as third-party claimants, before RTC?Makati, Branch 133, wherein
they claimed that their bank accounts cannot be garnished pursuant to a
judgment where they are not parties thereto is within the respondent court's
jurisdiction.  The respondent court found
basis in exercising its jurisdiction in Section 17, Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 17.  <i>Proceedings
where property claimed by third person</i>.   -- If property levied on be claimed by any other person than the
judgment debtor or his agent, and such person make an affidavit of his title
thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating the grounds of such right
or title, and serve the same upon the officer making the levy, and a copy
thereof upon the judgment creditor, the officer shall not be bound to keep the
property, unless such judgment creditor or his agent, on demand of the officer,
indemnify the officer against such claim by a bond in a sum not greater than
the value of the property levied on.  In
case of disagreement as to such value, the same shall be determined by the
court issuing the writ of execution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The officer is not liable for damages, for the taking or
keeping of the property, to any third-party claimant unless a claim is made by
the latter and unless an action for damages is brought by him against the
officer within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the
bond.  <u>But nothing herein contained
shall prevent such claimant or any third person from vindicating his claim to
the property by any proper action</u>.  (Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Jurisdiction over the subject matter of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">case is </span>conferred by law, and this
jurisdiction is determined by the allegations of the complaint.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In the allegations of the complaint filed by the respondents, they claimed that
there remains no unpaid subscriptions to which they may be held accountable
for, thus, they are third parties insofar as the judgment against MASD is
concerned.  They claim that the court
which issued the alias writ of execution authorizing the garnishment of their
bank accounts in satisfaction of the debt of MASD, acted outside of its
jurisdiction.  It is these allegations
which confer jurisdiction upon respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree with the petitioner that because they alleged in
their motion to dismiss that the respondents are incorporators of MASD with
unpaid subscriptions to which MII as judgment creditor may garnish and claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as satisfaction </span>of MASD's debt, the
respondent court loses jurisdiction over the case.  Jurisdiction cannot be made to depend upon the pleas and defenses
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">set </span>up by a defendant in a
motion to dismiss or answer, otherwise, jurisdiction should become dependent
almost entirely upon the defendant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Defense of lack of jurisdiction which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
</span>dependent on a question of fact does not render the court to lose or be
deprived of its jurisdiction.  The Court
has authority to hear evidence for the purpose of determining whether or not it
has jurisdiction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule that no court has power to interfere by injunction with
the judgments or decrees of a concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction having
equal power to grant the injunctive relief sought by injunction, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>applied in cases where no
third-party claimant is involved, in order to prevent one court from nullifying
the judgment or process <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span>another court of the same
rank or category, a power which devolves upon the proper appellate court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Because the power of the court in the execution of its judgment extends only to
properties belonging to the judgment debtor,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> the
Rules of Court grants <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>third-party
claimant remedies which were lucidly restated in <u>Sy vs. Discaya,</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As held in the case of <i>Ong vs. Tating</i>, <i>et al</i>.,
construing the aforecited rule, a third person whose property was seized by a
sheriff to answer for the obligation of the judgment debtor may invoke the
supervisory power of the court which authorized such execution.  Upon due application by the third person and
after summary hearing, the court may command that the property be released from
the mistaken levy and restored to the rightful owner or possessor.  What said court can do in these instances,
however, is limited to a determination of whether the sheriff has acted rightly
or wrongly in the performance of his duties in the execution of judgment, more
specifically, if he has indeed taken hold of property not belonging to the
judgment debtor.  The court does not and
cannot pass upon the question of title to the property, with any character of
finality.  It can treat of the matter
only insofar as may be necessary to decide if the sheriff has acted correctly
or not.  It can require the sheriff to
restore the property to the claimant's possession if warranted by the
evidence.  However, if the claimant's
proofs do not persuade the court of the validity of his title or right of
possession thereto, the claim will be denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Independent of the above-stated recourse, a third-party claimant
may also avail of the remedy known as "tercecia", provided in Section
17, Rule 39, by serving on the officer making the levy an affidavit of his
title and a copy thereof upon the judgment creditor.  The officer shall not be bound to keep the property unless such
judgment creditor or his agent, on demand of the officer, indemnifies the
officer against such claim by a bond in a sum not greater than<span style="font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> </span>the value of
the property levied on.  An action for
damages may be brought against the sheriff within one hundred twenty (120) days
from the filing of the bond.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The aforesaid remedies are nevertheless without prejudice to
"any proper action" that a third-party claimant may deem suitable to
vindicate "his claim to the property." Such a "proper
action" is, obviously, entirely distinct from that explicitly prescribed
in Section 17 of Rule 39, which is an action for damages brought by a
third-party claimant against the officer within one hundred twenty (120) days
from the date of the filing of the bond for the taking or keeping of the
property subject of the "terceria."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Quite obviously, too, this "proper action" would have for
its object the recovery of ownership or possession of the property seized by
the sheriff, as well as damages resulting from the allegedly wrongful seizure
and detention thereof despite the third-party claim; and it may be brought
against the sheriff and such other parties as may be alleged to have colluded
with him in the supposedly wrongful execution proceedings, such as the judgment
creditor himself.  Such "proper
action," as above pointed out, is and should be an entirely separate and
distinct action from that in which execution has issued, if instituted by a
stranger to the latter suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The remedies above mentioned are cumulative and may be resorted to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span>a third-party claimant independent
of or separately from and without need of availing of the others.  If a third-party claimant opted to file a
proper action to vindicate his claim of ownership, he must institute an action,
distinct and separate from that in which the judgment is being enforced, with
the court of competent jurisdiction even before or without need of filing a
claim in the court which issued the writ, the latter not being a condition <i>sine
qua non</i> for the former.  In such
proper action, the validity and sufficiency of the title of the third-party
claimant will be resolved and a writ of preliminary injunction against the
sheriff may be issued."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their second query, the petitioners contend that the issue to
be resolved by respondent court is whether or not RTC-Makati, Branch 146, erred
in its findings that certain persons have money due and owing to the judgment
creditor.  To this contention, We do not
agree because the issue joined in the case before the respondent court is
whether or not the respondents are third-party claimants as far as the
garnished bank accounts are concerned.  It would have been different if the respondents herein had been examined
and heard before the RTC-Makati, Branch 146 pursuant to Section 39, Rule 39 of
the Rules of Court, whereafter they have been found by said court to have
moneys due and owing to the judgment debtor.  In the latter case, RTC-Makati, Branch 133, would not have jurisdiction
to review such findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third and fourth queries do not involve the jurisdiction of
the court but mixed questions of fact and law involving the exercise of
jurisdiction by the lower court which would now involve mistakes of fact or
errors of judgment and/or of law which are correctible by appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Because <i>certiorari</i> is not a substitute for appeal,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
We are not ready to rule on the issues not involving jurisdiction or grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.  They may be pure questions of law, as
petitioner may put it, but still they are proper subjects of appeal, not <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Certiorari</i> does not lie in the instant case.  For <i>certiorari</i> to lie upon a court
having jurisdiction, there must be a capricious, arbitrary and whimsical
exercise of power.  The abuse of
discretion must be grave and patent, and it must be shown that the discretion
was exercised arbitrarily or despotically.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the respondent court.</p>
