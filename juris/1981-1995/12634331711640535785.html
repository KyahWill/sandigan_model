				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal interposed by accused Teresita del Mar alias
"Tata" alias "Eulanie" and Edison Sanchez y Sullivan from
the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the Regional Trial Court,
Seventh Judicial Region, Cebu City, Branch 7 in Criminal Case No. CBU-16919,
finding both accused guilty <span style="">beyond
reasonable doubt as principals for </span>violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act
of 1972 (RA 6425) and sentencing both accused to suffer the penalty of life
imprisonment.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 30, 1989 the Assistant Fiscal of Cebu City filed an
Information for Violation of Section 15, Article III in relation to Section 21,
Article IV of Republic Act No. 6425 against Teresita del Mar alias
"Tata" alias "Eulanie" and Edison Sanchez y Sullivan,
committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 27th day of October 1989 at about 2:45
P.M., in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the said accused, conniving and confederating together and
mutually helping each other, with deliberate intent, did then and there sell,
deliver and give away a shabu powder more or less one (1) gram wrapped on a
clear plastic containing METHYLAMPHETAMINE HCL, a regulated drug, without
authority of law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW." (Rollo, p. 1).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On arraignment, accused-appellants Teresita del Mar and Edison Sanchez
assisted by their respective counsels pleaded not guilty to the Information
(Records, p<span style="">. </span>23).</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented three (3) witnesses, to wit:  Police Lieutenant Myrna Areola, Sgt.
Alejandro Binan and Lieutenant Emmanuel Ughoc.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Myrna</u> <u>Areola</u>, a forensic analyst working at the PC
Crime Laboratory Services at Gorordo Avenue, Cebu City testified that she
examined certain specimens in connection with this case on the basis of a
letter-request dated October 27,1989 received from 1st Lt. Emmanuel Ughoc of
the PC/INP Narcotics Command 7th Narcotics Regional Unit (Records, p. 50;
Exhibit "A").  She subjected
the specimen consisting of a plastic bag of crystalline powder to a chemical
analysis (TSN, pp. 3-4, Hearing of January 1, 1990).  The result of the examination as shown in the Chemistry Report
No. C-363A-89 dated October 28, 1989 indicated the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"Chemical analysis conducted on the above-mentioned specimen
gave positive results for METHYLAMPHETAMINE, a Regulated drug, on EXHIBIT
`A’" (Records, p. 51; Exhibit "C").</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><u>Alejandro</u> <u>Binan</u>, a PC soldier assigned to the 7th
Narcotics Regional Unit stationed at Camp Lapulapu, Lahug, Cebu City since
1978, testified that on October 26, 1989 in the afternoon of that very day,
they were conducting a surveillance at Sundowners Hotel on the basis of an
information received by their Commanding Officer Major Hassan that a certain
Tata @ Melody and later on identified as Teresita del Mar was engaged in
selling prohibited drugs called methylamphetamine hydrochloride commonly known
as shabu powder at Sundowners Hotel.  As
a result of their surveillance, they concluded that she was engaged in the
illegal business because they found out and observed different faces of young
persons, mostly teenagers, visiting Room 526 where Teresita del Mar was
billeted.  After concluding that
Teresita del Mar was engaged in the selling of prohibited drugs, they decided
to conduct a buy-bust operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the buy-bust operation was conducted, he and Sgt. Muhamad
Said were designated to act as poseur-buyers.  They were supplied the amount of P1,200.00 in marked money to buy one
(1) gram of shabu powder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of October 27, 1989, they proceeded to
Sundowners Hotel.  He knocked at the
door of Room 526.  A person later
identified <span style="">as<i> </i></span>Edison
Sanchez opened the door.  They informed
him that they wanted to buy shabu.  Sanchez approached del Mar and the latter told Sanchez to let them in
the room.  When they were inside the
room, del Mar asked their intention.  They told her that they wanted to buy a gram of shabu powder.  She asked for the money and Sgt. Said gave
the P1,200.00 marked money to del Mar.  Del Mar got a pack of white cellophane containing a gram of shabu and
gave it to Sanchez who handed it to Sgt. Said.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the selling of said prohibited drugs was consummated, they
identified themselves <span style="">as<i> </i></span>NARCOM
agents and effected the arrest of Teresita del Mar and Edison Sanchez.  After that he opened the door and gave a
signal to their back-up.  Thereafter
their back-up, Lt. Ughoc, Sgt. Sevillena and Sgt. Recta also went inside the
room.  According to him, they were able
to recover a weighing scale, a weighing balance, aluminum foil, burner tubes
and other paraphernalia found on top of the table inside Room 526.  Other items recovered were <span style="">a<i> </i></span>list of customers' telephone
numbers, collectible amounts and also accused's own accountability with
Sundowners Hotel.</p>

<p class="BODY">He further testified that he had his initials written on the left
side shoulder of the picture of Manuel Roxas in every P100.00 peso bills of
marked money.  That the marked money was
recovered from the possession of Teresita del Mar placed inside a clutch
bag.  After the sale was consummated,
they confronted Teresita del Mar with regard to the contents of the clutch <span style="">bag.  </span>She
voluntarily showed to them the clutch bag containing P36,000.00 together with
the P1,200.00 in marked money (TSN, pp. 73-86, Hearing of January 9, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the direct examination, counsel for the defense
submitted a continuing objection that the receipt or certification signed by
Lt. Ughoc merely stated the articles seized as:  (a) P36,000.00 Philippine Currency and (b) assorted shabu
paraphernalia.  In other words, the
receipt for the articles seized was not properly detailed (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
79-80).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Emmanuel</u> <u>Ughoc</u>, also of the 7th Narcotics Command,
corroborated the testimony of Sgt. Alejandro Binan.  He testified that the buy-bust operation was conducted on October
27, 1989 at around 2:45 in the afternoon.  Sgt. Recla, Sgt. Sevillena and himself acted <span style="">as<i> </i></span>back-up while Sgt. Binan and <span style="">Sgt<i>.</i></span>Said acted <span style="">as
</span>poseur-buyers.  The poseur-buyers
went ahead to Room 526 while he, together with his back-up, posted themselves
near the vicinity.  Five minutes later,
more or less, Sgt. Binan opened the door of the room and told him to join
them.  He, together with his<b> </b>back-up,
entered the room.  When they entered,
the accused Teresita del Mar and Edison Sanchez were already under arrest and
since he saw some evidence placed on the table, he instructed his men to seize
the items so as to have corroborative evidence that the accused <span style="">is </span>really engaged in the illegal sale
of shabu.  They also confiscated the
amount of P36,000.00 because they believed that these were the proceeds of the
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The purchased shabu was <span style="">in
</span>the possession of Sgt. Said who in turn gave it to him and was indorsed
to the PC Crime Laboratory for laboratory examination.  The certification does not mention the shabu
because it was already in the possession of Sgt. Said and was not included with
the items confiscated from Teresita del Mar.  <span style="">The </span>certification was
signed by accused Teresita del Mar.  He
further testified that the serial numbers of the marked hundred peso bills were
listed in the diary of Major Hassan (TSN, pp.<sup> </sup>3-14, Hearing of February
22, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross examination, he testified that he did not include the
one (1) gram of shabu in the certification because it was already in the
possession of Sgt. Said.  Likewise the
marked <span style="">money was </span>not also
included in the list of confiscated items because the marked money is their
property (TSN, pp. 1-10, Hearing of March 13, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the vision of the defense is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Teresita</u> <u>del</u> <u>Mar</u> alias ‘Tata", denied
knowing about shabu, much less selling it.  She averred that she finished only first year high school.  She started working as a dancer or
entertainer when she was 18 years old.  Aside from Manila she also worked as <span style="">a<i> </i></span>dancer in Hongkong for two months in 1986.  She stayed at a San Juan apartment when she
was a dancer <span style="">in </span>Manila.  All her expenses were defrayed by her
boyfriends.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 19, 1989, she checked in at Sundowners Hotel in Cebu
City upon receipt of a long distance call from her boyfriend that he would be
arriving in Cebu.  She and her boyfriend
stayed there for four (4) days.  In the
afternoon of October 27, 1989, she met Edison Sanchez, her co-accused and whom
she knew since childhood because they were neighbors in Mandaue City.  She requested him to go to her hotel because
she wanted him to bring a certain amount of money to her father.  Upon arrival she told him to sit down while
she got her clutch bag.  While counting
the P5,000.00 she intended to give to her father at the receiving room of Room
526, there was a knock at the door.  Edison Sanchez peeped thru the "judas hole" upon her request
and saw no one.  She continued counting
the money.  The same thing happened the
second time she heard a knock.  As
requested by her, Sanchez opened the door and here were two persons whom she
did not know but identified as Sgt. Binan and Sgt. Said.  Although she was scared because she thought
that they were robbers, she allowed them to enter, having been/informed that
they just wanted to ask some questions.  Once inside the room, Sgt. Binan and Sgt. Said asked her whether she had
any shabu for sale.  She answered in the
negative.  She informed them further
that she knew nothing about shabu.</p>

<p class="BODY">She noticed<i> </i>Sgt.<i> </i>Binan was wearing a white t-shirt
and saw that there was something placed inside his waist so she suspected him
to be a policeman.  She did not notice
any suspicious bulky thing on the body of Sgt. Said.</p>

<p class="BODY">After telling them that she has no shabu, Sgt. Binan and Sgt.
Said left.  Thirty (30) minutes later,
after she handed the money to her co-accused Sanchez, and has given him the
instructions on how to deliver the money to her father, there was again a knock
at the door.  Sanchez opened it but no
one was there.  He closed the door.  She continued conversing with Sanchez.  After the conversation, Sanchez went out of
the room but was held back by Sgt. Binan and Sgt. Said.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. Binan<b> </b>made them sit down while Lt. Ughoc and the rest
of their companions subjected her room to an intensive search.  Moments later, one of the operatives opened
the refrigerator and said that he found shabu there.</p>

<p class="BODY">She declared that the only things confiscated from her room were
the amount of P36,000.00 and the weighing scale.  After that, she, together with Sanchez were brought to the NARCOM
Headquarters in Lahug where they were interrogated by Sgt<i>.</i> Binan.  She was not assisted by counsel during the
interrogation.  At 5:00 o'clock in the
afternoon, they were brought back to the hotel by Sgt. Binan, Sgt. Said, Lt.
Ughoc, Major Hassan and others whom she did not know.  They were able to enter Room 526 because she did not leave the
key downstairs.  The NARCOM agents
searched again her things.  After that
they showed her some things placed on top of the table she saw for the first
time.  She could not identify them but
according to the NARCOM agents they were for the use of shabu.  A picture was taken of her with the
confiscated items among which are those in Exhibits "Q" to
"W".  She denied having owned
the lists of customers which according to her she also saw for the first time,
only at the NARCOM office where she was interrogated.  She did not know who had made the entries therein; neither were
they in her handwriting.  She likewise
denied the allegation of the prosecution witness that she sold shabu to Sgt.
Binan and that she was paid P1,200.00 for it.  She, however, admitted having owned the clutch bag which contained
P31,000.00 cash after deducting the P5,000.00 which she gave to her co-accused
to deliver to her father.  She further
claimed that she signed the certification <span style="">on
</span>October 30, 1989 at around 2:00 o'clock <span style="">in </span>the afternoon after they came from the office of the City
Fiscal in a store somewhere at Ramos St., Cebu City, because she was made to
believe by Lt. Emmanuel Ughoc that it was only a receipt for her money so she
can claim it back.  She does not know
the owner of the store (TSN, pp. 3-20, Hearing of March 28, 1990; TSN, p. 2,
Hearing of March 29, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">She was forced to sign the certification because they told her
that she has to sign that document to show that it was really her money so that
she can get it back.  (TSN, pp. 2-10,
Hearing of March 29, 1990; TSN, pp. 2-23, Hearing of April 17, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Edison</u> <u>Sanchez</u>, 24 years old, a driver and a
resident of Mandaue City, corroborated in all material points the testimony of
his co-accused Teresita del Mar.  In
addition, he stated that after being informed by Sgts. Binan and Said that it
was a raid, they were made to sit down while the NARCOM agents searched the
room.  They informed them that they were
able to find shabu but it was not shown to them.  They also seized a weighing scale which he saw for the first time
and which was left by <span style="">a<i> </i></span>friend
of Teresita del Mar.  After that they
were brought to Lahug (TSN, pp<span style="">. </span>2-5,
Hearing of May 7, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross examination, Edison Sanchez testified that the money
given to him by Teresita del Mar was taken by Sgt. Binan even after he told
Sgt. Binan that the money was for the father of Teresita.  Sgt. Binan answered "Bahala na, for
what purpose is that money?" He did not see<b> </b>the money anymore.  Neither did he know where Sgt. Binan placed
the money (TSN, pp. 5-9, Hearing of May 7, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">In rebuttal, Sgt. Binan insisted that they entered Room 526 only
once and that was when they conducted the buy-bust operation on October 27,
1989 at 2:45 o'clock in the afternoon and not twice <span style="">as </span>alleged by accused Teresita del Mar; that the shabu which
they seized was actually handed to them as the subject of sale by Teresita del
Mar through her co-accused Edison Sanchez in consideration of the marked money
in the amount of P1,200.00 (TSN, pp. 2-6, Hearing of May 29, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, Lt. Emmanuel Ughoc testified that they entered Room 526
only after Sgt. Binan <span style="">gave </span>them
the pre-arranged signal.  He denied having
found shabu inside the refrigerator but, the same was handed to him by Sgt.
Said when they were already inside the room.  He corroborated the testimony of Sgt. Binan that they seized the shabu
paraphernalia right after they arrested the accused and not when they went back
to Room 526 after coming from the headquarters.  According to him, the accused together with all the seized
articles which were found on top of the table including the lists of supposed
customers were brought to the NARCOM Headquarters (TSN, pp. 2-4, Hearing of
June 13, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 31, 1990, the trial court rendered judgment, the decretal
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises above-set forth, the Court finds the
accused, Teresita del Mar alias 'Tata' alias 'Eulanie' and Edison Sanchez y
Sullivan, guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as principals, for violation of the
Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 (RA 6425), defined and punished in Sec. 15, Art.
III of the said Act, and hereby sentences both accused to the penalty of Life
Imprisonment, and each to pay a fine of P20,000.00, and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The paraphernalia or instruments seized and confiscated marked as
Exhibits 'Q' to 'W' are ordered confiscated and forfeited in favor of the
government and shall be turned over to the Dangerous Drugs Board, without
delay.  The gram of 'shabu' exhibit in
the case is ordered destroyed, without delay, in accordance with Sec. 20, Art.
IV of the same Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The amount of P36,000.00 seized from the accused not having been
explicitly shown to be actually the proceeds of the acts complained of, is
hereby ordered returned to said accused, Teresita del Mar.  The amount of P1,200.00 marked money is
ordered returned to the NARCOM, being the money used in their entrapment
operation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (Rollo, p.<sup> </sup>137; Decision, p. 37).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both accused appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Teresita del Mar raised the following
assignments of error, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in disregarding discrepancies in the evidence
of the prosecution which created reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the herein
appellant.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in finding that the prosecution was able to
prove that the herein appellant sold shabu.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in holding that the guilt of the accused was
proven by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote>The trial court erred in convicting the accused.  (p. 69, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, accused-appellant Edison Sanchez averred that the
prosecution failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which
essentially is the main thrust of both appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is well established that appellate courts will generally
not disturb the factual findings of the trial court, considering that it is in
a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves
and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial (People
v. Marzan, G.R. No. L-63265, March 21, 1984), this does not apply in the case
at bar where the lower court overlooked certain facts of substance and value
that if considered, would affect the result of the case (People v. Royeras, 130
SCRA 265 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has taken judicial notice of the many reports of
evidence being planted on unwary persons either for extorting money or exacting
personal vengeance in anti-narcotics operations, where by their very nature,
the need of entrapment procedures, the use of shady characters as informants,
the ease with which sticks of marijuana or grass of heroin can be planted in
pockets or hands of unsuspecting provincial hicks, and the secrecy that inevitably
shrouds all drug deals, thus, the possibility of abuse is great.  (People v. Ale, 145 SCRA 57 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Not unlike in the case at bar, a<i> </i>careful analysis of the
records shows certain inconsistencies and improbabilities that leave much to be
desired in the prosecution's evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt<i>.</i> Binan testified that in the surveillance they
conducted to confirm the veracity of the report that the accused was engaged in
selling shabu, they allegedly posted themselves in a place where nobody could
see them.  In fact they did not secure
the permission of the management of the hotel because the operation was very
confidential.  However, he admitted that
in order to see clearly people entering Room 526 of the accused in that hotel,
they had to stand as close as 5 to 6 meters from the door.  From that distance, it is obvious that they
cannot fail to arouse apprehension of the people they are observing.  Instead nobody appeared to have taken notice
despite the supposedly on-going heavy traffic of drugs between the accused and the
teenagers who kept coming and going to that room.</p>

<p class="BODY">His testimony is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>x x x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x

where did you conduct the surveillance?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can you please draw a sketch and indicate to
us the layout of the 5th floor from the place where you went out of the
elevator and the room where Teresita del Mar was billeted, at Room 526?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -  (Witness preparing a sketch
of the place where they posted near the room of the Sundowner Hotel No.
526).  I could hardly recall because of
the lapse of time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp; </span> -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You will agree with me Sgt. Binan that in this
sketch, there is a sort of an alley here going towards Room 526.  Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The end of the alley towards the other near
Room 526, that's about 19 to 21 steps.  Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could not recall the distance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of couse, from the place you cannot observe
who was entering Room 526 if you just stay in this alley here?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, we can see.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are you sure of that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Showing to you a picture, this is the usual
alley of Sundowner Hotel.  Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could see whether that is an alley of the
hotel going towards the room of 526.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But you are sure that if you stay at the
entrance of the alley, you can see who are entering the room of 526?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We can see.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My question was, if you stay in the alley
without going towards Room 526, or very near Room 526, you cannot see anybody
entering Room 526?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It could not be seen clearly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, you can only see
somebody going towards Room 526 if you really go near or about 1 or 2 steps
away from Room  526.  Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More than 5 steps, we could clearly see the
persons entering the room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Room 526, when it is open, the door is
open, it is open towards the inside not the outside.  Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now this alley was going towards Room
526.  From the  alley way, you cannot actually see Room 526.  Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It could be seen clearly if it is more than 5

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, before you can really observe
somebody entering or going out of Room 526, you must stay about 5 to 6 meters
from the door of that room before you can really observe what is going on, is
it not?</blockquote>

sir."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Cross examination:  Hearing of February 15, 1990, TSN, pp. 4-8;
Record, pp. 10?14).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. Binan also testified that when they conducted the
surveillance, they observed actually different faces of young persons visiting
Room 526.  But on cross examination,
although the hearing was only 3 or 4 months from such surveillance, he could
not recall how many teenagers went in and out of the said room.  He <span style="">was
</span>so sure that the accused was peddling shabu to said teenagers but he did
not even attempt to accost or arrest any of them if only to confirm his
suspicions.</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
many teenagers did you see going out or entering into the room of Room 526?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could no longer recall how many of them but
we observed that these were teen­agers going inside the room of Room 526.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was still sometime on October 1989, that
was 3 or 4 months ago and I’m sure you are mentally alert.  Would you say probably there were 2 or 3?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot say the number of persons or
teenagers going inside that room because we only observed many persons coming
in and coming out but not that we were counting the number of persons going in
and out of the room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You could not tell whether there were only
two (2) who entered the room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could not recall how many of them going in
and out.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You could not even recall whether there were
4 or 5?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot tell you exactly but I have observed
that there were persons, young men going inside and outside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You could not even tell us if there was only
one person who entered the room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said that these people were
teenagers.  Why did you say that they
were teenagers?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because as what I have observed, they were
more or less 18 years old.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now you said that because of the different
teenagers going in and out of Room 526, you concluded that del Mar was peddling
shabu to these teenagers.  Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now possession of shabu is illegal.  Is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, did you not even as much as attempt to
accost or try to arrest any of these teen­agers whom according to you were
buying shabu from del Mar while you were conducting that surveillance?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not attempt to arrest those customers because
our purpose in going there was to confirm the information as to whether
Teresita del Mar was really selling shabu.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since you were really convinced that Teresita
del Mar was selling shabu at Room 526 because according to you you saw
different teenagers going in and out of Room 526.  Did you not try to attempt to arrest del Mar right then and
there?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After confirming the information that del Mar
was really selling shabu, we conducted the buy-bust operation which resulted in
the arrest of del Mar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And that confirmation came about only because
you saw different teenagers going in and out of Room 526?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Hearing of February
15, 1990; TSN, pp. 8­-11, Record, pp. 14-17).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing testimony, which was full of inconsistencies and
prevarications material to the offense, was made to support the prosecution's
conjectures and conclusions, which lend credence to the categorical assertion
of counsel for the defense that Sgt. Binan was lying and that no such
surveillance was made.  (Rollo, p. 80).</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt<i>. </i>Binan further testified that he and Sgt. Mohamad Said
dressed as plainclothesmen with pistols under their shirts and looking hardly
like the accused's regular customers of teenagers, were immediately admitted <span style="">inside Room 526 </span>when they said that
they wanted to buy shabu without even checking their identities, their
referrals and recommendations.  Instead,
the only gram of shabu supposed to be in the possession of Teresita del Mar
stood ready for the taking of the NARCOM officers, not to mention an assortment
of shabu paraphernalia allegedly placed on top of the table.  The naivety if not stupidity of the
situation, does not inspire belief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surely, the supposed drug pushing in the proportion described by
the prosecution is not the drug pushing in a small scale contemplated by this
Court in People v. Paco, G.R. No. <span style="">76983,
170 SCRA 682 </span>[1989], which <span style="">may </span>be
committed at anytime and at any place, in a public place or even in the
presence of people.  With all the more
reason the improbability of the situation arrests attention, specially if one
takes into consideration that the alleged selling of shabu was done by
the"Shabu Queen"herself in one of the rooms of a plush hotel in
downtown Cebu City.  It is therefore
reasonable to expect that the queen of shabu, the accused, would at least
inquire who the prospective buyers were, or inquire who referred them to her,
or who told them her room number, considering that they were perfect strangers.  Additionally, she would have taken
precautions to hide the shabu paraphernalia supposedly on top of the table,
before allowing entrance to her room of people who were not her regular
customers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The buy-bust operation was described by Sgt. Binan as follows:</p>

<blockquote>    (Hearing of February 15,1990, TSN, pp.
13?15, Record, pp. 19-24).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In comparison, the version of both accused is easier to believe. </p>

<p class="BODY">Teresita del Mar's testimony that she was counting the P5,000.00
to be given by Edison Sanchez, her co-accused, to her father when there was a
knock on her door and her narration of her subsequent encounter with the NARCOM
officers had all the earmarks of truth.  Her reactions and those of the co-accused as described in her testimony
were more in accord with human behavior in the ordinary course of human
events.  The immediate admittance of the
NARCOM officers inside her room when they wanted to ask questions is the normal
behavior of persons who had nothing to hide.  In fact, despite rigid cross-examination, <span style="">her </span>testimony remained consistent and unrebutted.  She insisted that she does not know shabu
nor does she have any for sale.  The
fact that said officers could not find any in her room despite intensive
search, places in serious doubt the allegations of the latter that the only
gram of shabu which is the subject of the crime in this case, was sold to them
by Teresita del Mar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, her declaration that the only things confiscated from
her at the time of the raid were P36,000.00 and a weighing scale carries more
weight than the certification issued by Lt. Ughoc, merely stating the articles
seized as P36,000.00 Philippine currency and shabu paraphernalia which were not
identified.  No mention was made of the
gram of shabu.  The highly irregular
issuance of certification or receipt was brought to the attention of the court
by her defense counsel (Hearing of January 9, 1990, TSN, pp.7-8, Record, pp.
79-81) and confirmed by Lt. Ughoc himself when he was questioned by the court
on the matter as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
you inventory the seized items soon after you had them confiscated?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well, we did not identify invidually but like
for example shabu paraphernalia, we just placed it paraphernalia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This amount, this money consisting of
P36,000.00 was this inventoried?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How was it inventoried?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have (sic) counted the numbers of
denominations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you not have the proper listing of the
serial numbers of every deal?</blockquote>

listed were around?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The P36,000.00 Your Honor, we have not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You did not make a corresponding listing? </blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes Your Honor, only the marked money.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lt. Ughoc, you had been with the Narcom for
quite sometime and for every items seized during such operation, you issued
proper inventory.  Is it not?<span style=""> </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court wanted to know why did you not make
proper inventory especially this amount listed the serial number thereof
(sic)?  After which the person from whom
the same was seized may confirm by signing the same?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
have really issued a receipt to Teresita del Mar Your Honor, reflecting the
amount of P36,000.00 and the seized shabu paraphernalias, and it was properly
Signed by Teresita del Mar."</blockquote>

22, 1990, TSN, pp. 11-­12; Records, pp. 100-101).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the other items supposedly included in the general term
"assorted shabu paraphernalias" as appearing in the certification of
items seized, Lt. Ughoc explained:</p>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Teresita del Mar averred that it was only when
they arrived for the second time inside the hotel after coming from the NARCOM
office at Lahug, Cebu City, was she shown things she had not seen before, such
as the shabu paraphernalia.  Similarly,
it was the first time she saw shabu when Lt. Ughoc showed it to her as
allegedly taken from her refrigerator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on cross examination, Del Mar testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
mentioned that after bringing you to the Narcom Office at Lahug, Cebu City, you
were again brought to the hotel at Room 526.  Is this correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What took place inside that room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When we arrived for the second time inside
the hotel, in the room, they showed me again things which I have not seen
before.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT/to witness:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What were those things?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Things regarding shabu.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What do you mean things regarding shabu?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They said that can be used for shabu.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you see shabu?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was the first time I saw shabu when Lt.
Ughoc took from refrigerator.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How far was that clutch bag to that
refrigerator when that PC seized that clutch bag?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS:  (Witness indicating a distance of 2-3 meters).</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And in whose hands did you see that shabu?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lt. Ughoc, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was it shown to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was the clutch bag still on that table when
shabu was shown to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By then, that clutch bag was not touched by
the PC?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not yet, because they kept on searching my
things yet.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What I mean, when the shabu was shown to you
that clutch bag was still untouched by him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
yet."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Hearing of April 17, 1990,
TSN, pp. 12-13; Records, pp. 143-144)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Her statements were corroborated on all material points by her
co-accused Edison Sanchez, more specifically that the NARCOM officers were not
able to get anything from that raid, except <span style="">a</span><i style=""><span style=""> </span></i>weighing scale left by a friend
of Teresita del Mar (Hearing of May 7, 1990, TSN, pp. 4-6; Records, pp. 67-68)</p>

<p class="BODY">Teresita del Mar further testified that the lists of buyers of
shabu who were supposed to have bought shabu from her on credit do not belong
to her.  She did not make the entries
therein, much less were they in her handwriting.  According to her, the lists did not come from her room and that
she saw them only in the NARCOM office (Hearing of March 28, 1990, TSN, pp.
17-18; Records, pp. 127-128).  Correspondingly, as shown earlier Lt. Ughoc admited that he did not try
to investigate whether the list or the entries therein are in the handwriting
of the accused Teresita del Mar or Edison Sanchez.  In fact he did not even know if the signatures appearing therein
are the signatures of said accused (Hearing of March 13, 1990, TSN, pp. 5-6;
Records, pp. 46-47).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, while the prosecution appeared to have a penchant for
jumping at conclusions, among which was the seizure of P36,000.00 on the
presumption that they were the proceeds of the crime because the accused has no
legal means of livelihood (Hearing of March 13, 1990, TSN, pp. 7-8; Records,
pp. 48-49).  Teresita del Mar fully
accounted for the money in her possession candidly admitting that she worked as
a dancer or entertainer and she earned more than P3,000.00; that P3,000.00 is
not enough for her expenses but her boyfriends who are married men defrayed her
expenses; that when she checked in at Sundowners Hotel she had P20,000.00, the
rest which is P16,000.00 was given to her by her boyfriend (Hearing of March
29, 1990, TSN, pp. 7-8; Records, pp. 59-60).  Verily, when Teresita del Mar confessed her sordid way of life, she
convincingly explained her possession of a large amount of money which had
nothing to do with the sale of illegal drugs.  In fact, as observed by the trial judge, under the circumstances, the
seizure of aforesaid amount would not be warranted (Hearing of March 13, 1990,
TSN, p. 8; Records, p. 49).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the totality of the foregoing circumstance, the
improbabilities and inconsistencies of the allegations of the prosecution
cannot be ignored.  The exacting test
laid down by this Court in People v. Nazareno, 80 SCRA 484 (1977) was not
satisfied.  It was held that: "It
is thus required that every circumstance favoring his innocence be duly taken
into account.  The proof against him
must survive the test of reason, the strongest suspicion must not be permitted
to sway judgment.” Otherwise stated, moral certainty has not been reached.</p>
