				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A petition for probate of a holographic last will and testament
of Mateo <span class="SpellE">Ayllon</span>, Sr. was filed on 7 November 1977 by
the petitioner with the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court),
Branch VI, of <span class="SpellE">Guiuan</span>, Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Special Proceeding
No. 459.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said will, the testator made
disposition of specific properties to the petitioner, as his surviving spouse
with whom he had no children, and to the respondents, as his sons and daughters
by a first marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents
opposed the probate, and so hearings were held until the case was submitted for
decision at about the end of 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the case was awaiting the court's decision, the petitioner,
without the aid of a lawyer, entered into a verbal amicable settlement with the
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Relying on the verbal
settlement and believing that she will be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">given </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">one-half (1/2) of the house and lot situated at <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Guiuan</span>,
Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, in return for her abandoning the rest
of the properties willed to her, petitioner wrote her lawyer a letter
requesting the latter to file a motion to dismiss the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's lawyer complied with her
request.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
 bold">14 March 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, the case was dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the respondents apparently did not
comply with their verbal agreement with the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the petitioner filed an affidavit with
the court on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="22" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">22 March 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, asking for the
withdrawal of her motion to dismiss and for revival of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="9">7 September 1984</st1:date>,
the trial court reconsidered the order of dismissal, and revived the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, on 10 September 1985, the court issued
an order recalling the order of 7 September 1984, thereby reviving the order of
dismissal of 14 March 1984, on the grounds that (1) the case was amicably
settled, and (2) the petitioner failed to present three (3) witnesses who could
identify the handwriting of the testator in the disputed holographic will, as
provided under Article 811 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="9">23 September 1985</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of the trial court
dismissing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the case, but the motion was
denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon petitioner's appeal to the Court of Appeals, the latter
court required the petitioner to file a Record on Appeal within sixty (60) days
from notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The counsel of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the petitioner received the notice on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">11
 February 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, so
that the last day to file the record on appeal was on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">12 April
 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, instead of preparing and eventually
filing the Record on Appeal, the petitioner's counsel filed an Appeal Brief
dated </span><st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 15.0pt">28 February 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">, but actually filed through the mails on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">17 March 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, in a Resolution</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">, dated </span><st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">29 May 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal
on account of failure of counsel of the petitioner to file a record on appeal,
which is required in appeals in special proceedings, under Section 39 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, and Section 19 (b) of the Interim Rules and
Guidelines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>motion
for reconsideration of the Resolution of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="5">29 May 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
with the petitioner praying that her case be revived, and that she be allowed
to submit <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's counsel failed to file a record on appeal despite
due notice and the period of sixty (60) days given to him to file said record
on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of filing the record
on appeal, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>required, what
the petitioner's counsel did was to file an Appeal Brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even after petitioner's counsel received
a copy of the respondents' Motion for the Dismissal of the Appeal for failure
of the petitioner to file record on appeal, nothing was done by petitioner's
counsel to correct or amend the erroneous procedure he had taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is clear that the failure of the
petitioner, through counsel, to file the record on appeal was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">inadvertent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, petitioner's counsel ignored compliance with the
requirement of filing a record on appeal, as provided for by the Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is no reversible error on the
part of the Court of Appeals, in dismissing petitioner's appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing narration of facts and events illustrates once more
an instance where the client has to suffer due to the fault of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, as held in several cases<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,
a client is bound by the mistakes and omissions of his counsel, so that if an appeal
is lost through the unjustified neglect of counsel, as happened in the instant
case, that loss is binding upon the client.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, even as we sustain the action taken by the respondent
Court of Appeals in dismissing petitioner's appeal, and, with said dismissal,
petitioner has, in effect, lost the right to establish the validity of the
alleged holographic will of the late Mateo <span class="SpellE">Ayllon</span>,
yet, as his surviving spouse, petitioner has not lost her hereditary rights
which are acquired by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, in the
interest of justice, and to avoid multiplicity of suits, the trial court in
Special Proceeding No. 459 may be required, as it is hereby required to
determine and adjudicate the respective hereditary shares of petitioner and
respondents in the estate of the late Mateo <span class="SpellE">Ayllon</span>,
in accordance with the rules on intestate succession.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">, </span>the petition is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">DENIED, </span>but the case is remanded to
the trial court for further proceedings, specifically, to determine and
adjudicate to the petitioner and respondents their respective hereditary shares
in the estate left by Mateo <span class="SpellE">Ayllon</span>, in accordance
with the rules on intestate succession.</p>
