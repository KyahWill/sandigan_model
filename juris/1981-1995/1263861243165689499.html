				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> seeking to annul and set
aside the decision of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the dismissal of the
petitioner's complaint on the ground that compensation cannot take place
between the petitioner and the private respondents as its requi­sites are not
present.</p>

<p class="BODY">In September, 1978, petitioner Pioneer Insurance and Surety
Corporation issued general warehousing bonds in favor of the Bureau of Customs
for importation of raw materials in the total amount of P6<span class="GramE">,500,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bonds were issued on behalf of the
private respondents <span class="SpellE">Wearever</span> Textile Mills, Inc., and
its president, Vicente T. Lim.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">To secure the petitioner
from and against any and all harm, damages and losses of whatever kind and
nature which it may incur as a consequence <span class="GramE">of</span> its
becoming a surety upon the bonds, the respondents executed jointly and
severally in favor of the petitioner indemnity agreements for said bonds each
of which contain the following stipulations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"INDEMNITY: - The undersigned, jointly and severally, agree
and bind themselves to indemnify and hold and save harmless the Corporation
from and against any and all damages, losses, costs, stamps, taxes, pe­nalties,
charges and expenses of whatsoever kind and nature which the Corporation shall
or may at any time incur in consequence of having become surety upon the
bond/note or any extension, renewal, substitution or alter­ation thereof made
at the instance of the undersigned or executed on behalf of the undersigned or
any of them; and to pay, re­imburse and make good to the Corporation, its
successors and assigns, all sums and amounts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">of m</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">oney, </span>which
it or its representatives shall or may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pay

and nature including 20% of the amount involved in the litigation or other
matters growing out of or connected therewith for attorney's fees but in no
case to be less than P200.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
undersigned further agree, jointly and severally, that in case of any extension
or renewal of the bond/note, to bind ourselves for the payment thereof under
the same terms and conditions, as above-mentioned, without the necessity of
executing another Indemnity Agreement for the purpose and we hereby equally
waive our right to be notified of any renewal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">or </span>extension of the bond/note which may be granted under this
Indemnity Agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"MATURITY OF OUR OBLIGATIONS CONTRACTED HEREWITH: - The above
indemnities shall be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">paid to the
corporation as soon as demand is received from the creditor or as soon as it
becomes liable to make payment of any sum under the terms of the
above-mentioned bond/ note, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">its </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">renewal, extensions or substitutions whether
the said sum or sums or part thereof have been actually paid or not.” (pp.
29-30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The private respondents
failed to comply with their commitment under the warehousing bonds by reason
whereof the Bureau of Customs demanded from the petitioner payment of the value
of the said bonds in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,390,259.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This amount eventually reached P9<span class="GramE">,031,000.00</span> in 1983.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, in response to the petitioner's demand letter,
the private respondents wrote petitioner promising that they will settle their
obligations with the Bureau of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On representations by private respondents to the Bureau of
Customs, the latter granted the request of respondents for staggered monthly
installment payments of their obligation on condition that the respondents will
make an initial payment of P500<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and there­after
shall amortize the balance at P400,000.00 monthly until fully paid pursuant to
the first <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> by the Bureau of Customs dated
September 22, 1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other than the
initial payment of P500<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, however, res­pondents
have not made any other payments thereby viola­ting the terms of the said
agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">As a result of the
foregoing, the Bureau of Customs again demanded from the petitioner payment of
its bonds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No payment, however, has been
made as yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1979, a fire gutted the respondents' factory
destroying materials insured with the petitioner in the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,144,744.49</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents demanded from the petitioner payment of the proceeds of the
insurance policy but the latter refused to pay claiming that said proceeds must
be applied by way of partial compensation or set-off against its liability with
the Bureau of Customs arising from the warehousing bonds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The petitioner's efforts
to protect itself from total loss in the much bigger amount of P6,390,259.00
which as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>April 19, 1983 had
already reached P9,031,000.00 having proved fruitless, the complaint for
compensation was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">filed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">below.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the private
respondents and ordered the petitioner to pay, among others, the insurance
proceeds in the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of P1<span class="GramE">,144,744.49</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">plus
legal interest from </span><st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">November 19, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> until the whole amount is fully paid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's
decision, holding that legal compensation can­not take place because the
requisites thereof are not present, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>that petitioner is not the creditor of private respondents; and that the
<span class="SpellE">former's</span> claim against the latter is not due,
demandable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>liquidated
because its liability on the warehousing bonds was extinguished when the
textile goods covered by the same were destroyed by the fire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, according to the appellate court
since the petitioner and private respondents are not mutually creditors and
debtors to each other, the law on compensation is inapplicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, Pioneer Insurance alleges that legal
compensation or set-off under Articles 1278 and 1279 can take place because
there is due to private res­pondents from the petitioner the amount of
P1,144,744.49 as proceeds of the fire insurance policy in the same manner that
the private respondents are bound, jointly and severally, to reimburse
petitioner what the latter is liable to pay the Bureau of Customs in the total amount
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of P6,390,259.00 and which, as of the
date of the filing of the complaint, had already reached P9,031,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner also stresses that even if it
has not yet paid the Bureau of Customs any amount, the private respondents have
already become indebted to the petitioner pursuant to the indemnity agreement
which stands as the law between the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On the other hand, the
private respondents argue that the demands to pay made by the Bureau of Customs
did not prove nor create any liability and even if they did, the liability
under the warehousing bonds in favor of the Bureau of Customs was the liability
of the peti­tioner; that petitioner did not pay and has never paid the Bureau
of Customs under the warehousing bonds and, therefore, the private respondents
have nothing to reimburse the petitioner for and that the approved staggered
payment arrangement of the respondents with the Bureau of Customs released
petitioner from liability under the warehousing bonds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We rule for the
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reiterated the requisites of legal compensation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Compensation shall take place when two persons, in their own
right, are creditors and debtors of each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

Code are <span class="GramE">present,</span> compensation takes effect by
operation of law, even without the consent or knowledge of the debtors.' (Art.
1290, Civil Code). Art. 1279 of the Civil Code requires among others, that in
order that legal compensa­tion shall take place, 'the two debts be due' and
'they be liquidated and demand­able.' Compensation is not proper where the
claim of the person asserting the set?off against the other is <span class="GramE">not clear nor</span> li­quidated; compensation cannot extend to <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>, disputed claim arising from breach of
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Compania</span> General de <span class="SpellE">Tabacos</span> v.

<blockquote>"There can be no doubt that petitioner is indebted to private
respondent in the amount of P1,062,063.83 representing the proceeds of her
money market investment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But whether private res­pondent
is indebted to petitioner in the amount of P6.81 million representing the
deficiency balance after the foreclosure of the mortgage executed to secure the
loan extended to <span class="GramE">her,</span> is vigorously disputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance prevents legal compensa­tion
from taking place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(CA
Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 112-113)."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">There is no dispute that
the petitioner owes the </span>private respondents the amount representing the
proceeds of the insurance policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
private respondents, however, try to negate their liability by questioning the
veracity and accuracy of the Bureau of Customs' demand letters to the
petitioner and by claiming that they have no more liability because of the
fortuitous event.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time,
however, they admit liability when they argue that the petitioner was released
from the same upon their agreement with the Bureau of Customs to make staggered
payments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the private
respondents argue that since the petitioner has not made any payment yet
regarding the amount demanded by the Bureau of Customs, there is nothing for
which the petitioner should be reimbursed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">It is needless to
emphasize that at the time the fire occurred, the private respondents together
with the petitioner had already incurred liability on the warehousing bonds
with the Bureau of Customs because of the respondents' inability to comply with
the provisions of their undertaking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is, therefore, clear that as far as the amount of P9<span class="GramE">,031,000.00</span>
is concerned, both the petitioner and respondents were already liable for said
amount to the Bureau of Customs when the contin­gency for which compensation is
sought, happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nei­ther can the
respondents </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">claim </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that the petitioner was released from
liability when they made arrangements with the Bureau of Customs for staggered
payments since the facts will bear out that other than the P500,000.00 payment
by respondents, no further payment was made by them </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">thus leading the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Bureau of Customs to go after the petitioner
again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private <span class="GramE">respondents,</span>
contend, however, that since the petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">has not made any </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">payment
with the Bureau of Customs, it cannot demand reimbursement and, thus,
petitioner cannot apply legal compensation or set-off against them because
their liability has not yet become due and demandable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">petitioner admits its liability
