				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary
injunction seeking that the orders of respondent judge dated <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1978</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1979</st1:date> in Special Case No.
2079, Court of First Instance of Davao City, be declared null and void and set
aside, with costs against the respondent Investors' Finance Corporation (FNCB
Finance).</p>

<p class="BODY">The order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="12">December
 13, 1978</st1:date> reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The Compromise Agreement forged between the Intestate Estate
of Casimiro <span style="">F. </span>Arkoncel, Sr.,
represented by its administrator, Casimiro V. Arkoncel, Jr., and the FNCB
Finance Corpora­tion, having become final and executory, the motion for
execution filed by the plaintiff thru counsel should be, as it is hereby,
granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, let a writ of execution issue forthwith."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The order of <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="1">January 12,
 1979</st1:date> denied the Motion for Reconsi­deration filed by petitioner for
lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The late Casimiro F. Arkoncel died intestate on <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1976</st1:date> at <st1:place><st1:placename>Davao</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> (his residence at the time of
his death), leaving behind an estate with a probable value of about
P241,020.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1976</st1:date>, a petition for letters of
administration seeking, among others, for the appointment of the widow Maria V.
Vda. de Arkoncel as administrator over the intestate estate of the deceased,
was filed <span style="">by </span>one of the heirs,
Nenita C. Valdez, and docketed as Special Case No. 2079 in the Court of First
Instance of Davao City, Branch I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
the other heirs manifested their conformity to the appointment of the surviving
spouse, Maria V. Vda. de Arkoncel.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4">April
 1, 1977</st1:date>, the intestate Court<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a>
identified the heirs of the deceased Casimiro F. Arkoncel as Maria V.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vda. de Arkoncel, widow; Casimiro V.
Arkoncel, Jr., son; Florencio V. Arkoncel, son; Maria V. Arkoncel, daughter;
and Nenita Carpio Valdez, daughter, but appointed Casimiro V. Arkoncel, Jr.,
the eldest son, as the judicial administrator without bond instead of Maria V.
Vda. de Arkoncel, the widow and ordered the issuance to him of letters of
administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same order, the
Court of First Instance allowed him one year within which to dispose of the
estate and to <span style="">pay </span>the debts of
the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letters of admi­nistration
issued on <st1:date year="1977" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1977</st1:date>
gives Casimiro V. Arkoncel, Jr., petitioner herein, full authority as
Administrator of the estate of Casimiro F. Arkoncel, to take possession of all
the property of said deceased and to perform all other acts necessary for the
pre­servation of said property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 5, 1977, the intestate court issued an order giving
notice to all persons having money claims against the decedent Casimiro F.
Arkoncel, "arising from contract, express or implied, whether the same be
due, not due or contingent, all claims for funeral expenses and expenses of the
last sickness of the said decedent, and judgment for money against him to file
them in the Office of the Clerk of Court within six (6) months after the date
of the first publication of the notice" in the Mindanao Mail, a newspaper
of general circulation in the City and Province of Davao, wherein the notice <span style="">was </span>to be published once a week for
three con­secutive weeks.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the order of the intestate court, FNCB
Finance, respondent herein, filed on <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="10">October
 7, 1977</st1:date> with the court <u>a quo</u> its claim against the estate
for the payment of certain debts incurred by the decedent during his lifetime,
in the following amounts:</p>

<blockquote>Principal sum
---------------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P44,438.00</blockquote>

<blockquote>Interests
----------------------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(to
be com­puted later at 14% p.a.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Attorney's
fees--------------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>11,109.50</blockquote>

<blockquote>Liquidated
damages------------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>4,443.38</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1978</st1:date>,
petitioner herein, in his capacity as administrator of the estate of Casimiro
F. Arkoncel and the claimant FNCB Finance, assisted by their respective
counsels, entered into an amicable settlement, under the following terms and
conditions:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the Judicial Administrator admits the
claim of herein claimant against the estate, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a) P44,438.00 -
representing the out­standing principal balance of the Torana car purchased for
the use and benefit of the decedent Casimiro F. Arkoncel and financed by herein
claim­ant;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) Interest on the
outstanding principal balance from the date of default in the payment of the
latter on <st1:date year="1977" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1977</st1:date>
until fully paid at the rate of 14% per annum;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>c) P11,109.50 or 25%
of the outstanding principal balance as and for attor­ney's fees;</blockquote>

<blockquote>d) Costs of and
expenses in this suit in the amount of P200.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
the claimant, with the conformity of its counsel, is willing to reduce, as it
hereby reduces, its claims for attorney's fees to 15% of the principal balance
or to P6,665.70." (Rollo, p. 35)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The intestate Court approved the amicable settlement in an order
dated May 17, 1978, directing the parties to strictly comply with the terms
thereof and the Judicial Administrator, "to pay the amounts agreed upon
out of the estate funds and/or properties within 30 days from receipt" of
the said order (Rollo, p. 37).</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the Judicial Administrator, petitioner herein,
was served thru counsel a copy of the aforementioned order on <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1978</st1:date> but the claim of
private respondent had remained unpaid thirty (30) days after.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1978</st1:date> private respondent filed with the
intestate court a motion for execution praying for the issuance of a writ of
execution to satisfy its claims (Rollo, p. 39) which was opposed by petitioner
(Rollo, p. 42).</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the motion, respondent judge issued the questioned
order of <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1978</st1:date>
granting the motion for execution and the issuance of a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration filed by
petitioner on December 28, 1978 was denied by re­spondent judge for lack of
merit in an order dated January 12, 1979 holding that "the order of this
Court dated May 17, 1979 approving the amicable settlement voluntarily entered
into by the parties x x x is a perfectly valid order which was a decision in
itself based on the compromise agreement" (Rollo, p. 57).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this pe­tition filed with the Court by
petitioner on <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1979</st1:date>,
the Court resolved to give due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had submitted their respective memoranda, the
Court declared the case submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1988</st1:date>,
the Court resolved to require the parties to move in the premises within 30
days from notice; otherwise the case shall be considered terminated and
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with the same
Resolution, petitioner, on <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="5">May 13,
 1988</st1:date>, manifested that there exists no supervening events (that have
taken place in the interim) that may have rendered the case moot and academic
(Rollo, p. 96).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent
manifested that as matters stand, as between the petitioner and the private
respondent, the instant case is <span style="">now </span>ripe
for disposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also brought to the
attention of the Court the fact that the issue in the instant case is one of
the errors assigned by the petitioner in his appeal from the decision in Civil
Case No. 2079 to the Court of Appeals, which was docketed and considered by the
latter Court under AC-G.R. CV No. 04426, the two other issues being (a) that
the trial court erred in not finding that the Officer-in-Charge of the Office
of the Clerk of Court of the Court <u>a quo</u> (formerly Davao Court of First
Instance, Branch I) is not authorized by law to cause to be issued the
controversial alias writ of execution; and (b) that the trial court erred <span style="">in </span>not finding that when a subject
matter is pending before the Supreme Court, such as the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
the court <u>a quo</u> should refrain from issuing implementing orders on the
questioned subject-matter (Rollo, p. 99).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Third Division of the Court to which the case was transferred
on <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1988</st1:date> (Rollo, p.
109) resolved to note the manifestations of both parties in its Resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue of the case is:</p>

<blockquote>"WHETHER OR NOT
RESPONDENT JUDGE ACTED WITHOUT OR IN EXCESS OF HIS JURISDICTION IN ORDERING THE
ISSUANCE OF A WRIT OF EXECUTION FOR THE PAYMENT OF A DEBT IN AN ADMINISTRATION
PRO­CEEDINGS." (Rollo, p. 76).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What transpired after the case was elevated to the Court in this
instant <i>certiorari</i> case is described by the appellate Court in its
decision in AC-G.R. No. 04426, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x x </span>Motion
for Reconsideration having been denied, the administrator elevated the issue as
G.R. No. 50526, Casimiro V. Arkoncel, Jr. etc. v. Hon. Judge Alfredo G.
Lagamon, etc. et al., on <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunc­tion to the
Supreme Court which initially re­quired comments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the elevation, ap­pellee filed
motion for alias writ of execu­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Supreme Court required comments, thereafter, the intestate court granted the
motion for alias writ which was issued over the signature of the Officer-in-Charge
of the Office of the Davao Court of First Instance Clerk of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pursuant to the alias writ, the Davao Pro­vincial Sheriff caused
levy to be made on a piece of property with an area of 1,136 square meters
under TCT No. 2436 (T-1339) which forms <span style="">part
of the estate.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court gave due course but did not issue an injunction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Provincial Sheriff thereafter sold the property at public
auction at which the appellee was the highest bidder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Before expiry of the redemption, the ad­ministrator filed this case
for the declaration of nullity of certain proceedings, <span style="">damages and preliminary injunction x x x."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The aforementioned supervening events form the bases of the
appeal made to the appellate court but the third assigned error which is
"that the trial court erred in not finding that a writ of execution is not
the property remedy/procedure to satisfy money claims or for the payment of
debts before an intestate court in an administration proceedings" (Rollo,
p. 104), is the same issue brought before the Court in this instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court, however, aware of the
pending issue before the Court, made no ruling on this issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply declared:</p>

<blockquote>"The issue in this error (sic) is squarely raised in G.R. No.
50526, <b>supra</b>, where de­cision still pends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carefully mindful of the fact that the
Supreme Court is the final arbiter of dispute, we refrain from passing judgment
upon the issue brought up by this assignment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of practice, it is more advisable in a situation like this
one to defer to the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
not incon­ceivable that our appreciation may run counter to the Supreme Court
decision in which event it will be for naught anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in any case, whatever may be the ruling
from this Court on the issue will provide no comfort to either the appellant or
the appellees both of whom must await the Supreme Court decision on the
matter." (Rollo, p. 106).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is indeed a need for the Court to rule squarely on the
issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Judicial Administrator voluntarily entered into an ami­cable
settlement with the claimant FNCB Finance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was not only assisted by counsel but the agreement itself was
confirmed by the other heirs, the widow Maria V. Vda. de Arkoncel, Florencio V.
Arkoncel and Maria V. Arkoncel (Mesias).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other heir, Nenita C. Valdez, was represented by her
Attorney-in-Fact David O. Montano who is at the same time counsel for the other
heirs and the judicial administrator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The agreement was submitted to the intestate court for approval and it
was duly approved by the court <u>a quo</u> in an order dated May 17, 1978
which incorporated the condi­tions therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court approves a compromise agreement when not contrary to law,
morals or public policy and renders judgment in accordance therewith (Jose v.
Chem Samco and Sons, Inc., 125 SCRA 142 [1983]; Alejandro v. Philippine
Airlines, 127 SCRA 660 [1984]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant case, judgment was rendered in consonance with the compromise agreement
and the parties were enjoined to comply with and abide by its terms and
conditions (Gravador v. Elbinias, 126 SCRA 205 [1983]; G &amp; S Corporation v.
Court of Appeals, 126 SCRA 212 [1983]; National Housing Authority v. Abaya, 129
SCRA 412 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that a judgment rendered in accordance with a
compromise agreement is immediately executory unless a motion is filed <span style="">to </span>set aside the agreement on the
ground of fraud, mistake or duress in which case an appeal may be taken against
the order denying the motion (De Guzman v. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA 730
[1985]; Zagala v. Jimenez, 152 SCRA 148 [1987]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then becomes ministerial for the lower
court to order the execution of its final executory judgment (Service
Specialists Incorporated v. Sheriff of Manila, 145 SCRA 139 [1986]; Landicho v.
Tensuan, 151 SCRA 410 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even more than a contract which may be enforced by ordinary
action for specific performance, the compromise agreement is part and parcel of
the judgment, and may therefore be enforced as such by a writ of execution
(Tria v. Lirag, 1 SCRA 1207 [1961]; Osmena v. Court <span style="">of </span>Agrarian Relations, 17 <span style="">SCRA
</span>828 [1966]; Paredes v. Court of Appeals, 132 SCRA 501 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, when the terms of an amicable settlement are violated,
as in the case at bar, the remedy of the aggrieved party is to move for its
execution (Valdez v. Octaviano, 1 SCRA 744 [1961]; Paredes v. Court of Appeals,
132 SCRA 501 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that properties in <u>custodia legis</u> may
not be the proper subject of a writ of execution to satisfy a claim; that what
private respondent could have done was to ask the Court <u>a quo</u> for an
order requiring the administrator to pay the debt and <span style="">only if </span>there are no sufficient funds on hand to pay the debt
may the court order the sale of the properties and out of the proceeds, to pay
the debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is untenable
inasmuch as the dispo­sitive portion of the very order approving the amicable
settlement directs the judicial administrator to pay the claim of FNCB Finance
out of the funds and/or properties of the estate, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Conformably, the Judicial Administrator is hereby directed to
pay out of the estate <span style="">funds and/or
properties the amounts agreed upon within 30 days from receipt hereof."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, petitioner Judicial Administrator chose not to
comply with said order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the
compromise agreement is part and parcel of the judgment and may, therefore, be
enforced as such by a writ of execution, the respondent judge committed no
reversible error in issuing the questioned writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is Dismissed for lack of
merit.</p>
