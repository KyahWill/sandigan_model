				<BR><STRONG>PUNO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Accused Angelita Manalo is not unaccustomed to prosecution for
violation of our anti-drug law (Republic Act 6425).  On June 21, 1990, she was arrested for violation of sections 15
and 18 of Article III of the said law.  She was subjected to inquest by the Prosecutor's Office.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
In August 1991, confidential information was again received by the Dangerous
Drugs Enforcement Division (DDED) of the Pasig Police Station <span style="">concerning her drug trafficking activities.  A surveillance of Manalo's illegal
activities was </span>conducted by operatives of the DDED headed by P02 Adonis
Corpuz.  They were able to establish
that Manalo was conducting her illegal drug trade <span style="">at </span>Rotonda, Caniogan, Pasig.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Chief of DDED of the Pasig police station then formed a
buy-bust team composed of the following operatives:  SPO1 Francisco Evangelista, SPO1 Marlon Paulete, P03 Graciano
Delosata, P03 Benjamin Placido and SPO3 Dominador Cruz.  P02 Corpuz acted as the poseur-buyer while
the other operatives served as his back-up men.  On January 24, 1992, the team proceeded to Rotonda, Caniogan,
Pasig.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
At around ten (10:00) o'clock in the evening, Corpuz casually approached the
accused and said:  "Paiskor ng
piso"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and handed to her a previously marked one hundred (P100.00) peso bill.  Manalo reached out for the P100 bill and
handed Corpuz a deck of "shabu." The transaction having been
consummated, Corpuz signaled his back-up operatives to apprehend Manalo.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After her arrest, Manalo was brought to the police headquarters
where a policewoman, P02 June Valencia, bodily searched her.  Found in her possession was the P100 bill
given to her by Corpuz, a deck of "shabu," a sealed plastic bag which
contained an undetermined amount of suspected "shabu," another
plastic bag containing an undetermined amount of suspected marijuana leaves and
an improvised glass tooter containing suspected "shabu" residue.  Policewoman Valencia testified how and where
the accused hid the "shabu" and marijuana leaves, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the suspect
Angelita Manalo <span style="">was </span>brought to the police station, (w)hat order was given to you
by your (C)hief?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
ordered me to conduct <span style="">a</span><i style=""><span style=""> </span></i>body
search on the suspect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
what was the result of the body search?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
recovered from her:  one (1) deck of
shabu in aluminum foil; the P100.00 bill used in the buy-bust <span style="">operation; one (1) heat-sealed plastic bag
with marijuana leaves and an improvised tooter.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
clarity's sake, Ms. Witness, where did you recover the deck of shabu and the
improvised tooter?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In Ms. Manalo's black shoulder bag.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
about the plastic bag containing an undetermined amount of shabu?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
was inserted inside her vagina, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
about the marijuana leaves?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
was inserted at (sic) her rectum, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

likewise made.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The qualitative examination of the articles seized from Manalo
revealed that the plastic bags contained methamphetamine hydrochloride
("shabu"), a regulated drug.  Another bag was tested positive for marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>

methamphetamine hydrochloride.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, Angelita Manalo was charged in two (2) separate
Informations with violations of Republic Act 6425, particularly:  Section 8, Article II for possession or use
of prohibited drugs, and; Section 15, Article III for sale of regulated drugs
without authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Information in Criminal Case No. 1869-D-92, for violation of
Section 8, Article II of R.A. 6425 reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 24th day of January, 1992, in the

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO

<p class="BODY">The two (2) criminal cases were filed and jointly tried at the
Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Metro Manila, Branch CLVIII.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the accused admitted her presence at the scene of
the crime.  She, however, denied selling
"shabu" to Corpuz.  She
explained that on said date and time, she was in the company of a certain Jorge
Alombro, a Taguig policeman, inside an owner-type jeep.  Their jeep was parked beside a hamburger
store in Caniogan, Pasig where they were waiting for the hamburger they ordered.  From out of nowhere, a passenger jeepney
parked in front of their vehicle.  A
certain Sgt. Dominador Cruz alighted therefrom and asked her to come with
him.  When she refused, Sgt. Cruz pulled
her out of the jeep by force.  She
resisted and began hitting him with her bag.  Alombro pacified her and told her to stop screaming.  She complied and handed over her bag to Sgt.
Cruz.  De Lara, Corpuz and Greg searched
her bag.  The hamburger attendant
likewise searched her body.  Both
yielded nothing.  She was, nevertheless,
taken by force to the Pasig Police Station where she was asked to strip
naked.  She was bodily searched by a
female detention prisoner.  Again, no
illegal drugs were found in her possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, a decision was rendered by Judge Hernandez
acquitting the accused in Criminal Case No. 1869-D-92 for failure of the
prosecution to present PO2 June Valencia who seized the marijuana from the
accused during her body search.  However, the accused was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt in
Criminal Case No. 1870-D-92 for selling "shabu" without
authority.  Accused was sentenced to
suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of <span style="">thirty </span>thousand pesos (P30,000.00) and
the cost of the suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant contends that:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE TO
THE PROSECUTION'S VERSION THAT THE ACCUSED HAD BEEN APPREHENDED <u>IN</u> <u><span style="">FLAGRANTE</span></u><span style=""> </span>SELLING METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE IN THE COURSE OF A
NARCOTIC BUY-BUST OPERATION WHICH HAD BEEN REGULARLY CONDUCTED BY THE MEMBERS
OF THE DANGEROUS DRUGS ENFORCEMENT DIVISION, PASIG POLICE STATION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II.</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE

UNMINDFUL OF THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION WHICH FAILED
TO PROVE BEYOND THE CAVIL OF DOUBT THE IDENTITY OF THE METHAMPHETAMINE
HYDROCHLORIDE ALLEGED TO BE THE OBJECT OF SALE AND OMITTED TO PROVE THAT THE
ACCUSED HAD NO LEGAL AUTHORITY OR LICENSE TO SELL THE ALLEGED REGULATED DRUG.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assigned error, accused-appellant
challenges the credibility of the testimony of prosecution witness PO2 Adonis
Corpuz who acted as the poseur-buyer.  She charges that nowhere in the records was it shown that the
poseur-buyer introduced himself to her as a drug-user.  Neither was it shown that the poseur-buyer
had been her regular customer.  Under
such circumstances, accused-appellant claims that it is highly improbable for
her to instantaneously produce and sell to PO2 Cruz a given quantity and
quality of "shabu."</p>

<p class="BODY">Our rulings on this issue are clear and consistent.  Trafficking of prohibited and regulated
drugs has become so rampant that it is not uncommon for drug pushers to sell
their wares to total strangers.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> Nor
is it incredulous that the accused-appellant readily produced the required
quality and quantity of illegal drug at a moment's notice.  A lot of drug pushers and retailers possess
a ready stock of "shabu" or marijuana, pre-packed in varying
quantities, for a fast sale to a willing buyer.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accussed-appellant likewise hoists the defense that the
prosecution evidence showed that the poseur-buyer instigated her to commit the
crime charged.  She maintains that with
the poseur-buyer's offer to buy, she was lured to sell regulated drug despite
her lack of intention to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">There <span style="">is </span>a
well-cut distinction between "instigation" and "entrapment"
in criminal law.  We delineated this
distinction in <b><i><span style="">People v. Ramos,
Jr.</span></i></b><i><span style=""> </span></i>(203
SCRA 237, 243) as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In entrapment, the idea to commit the crime originates from
the accused.  Nobody induces or prods
him into committing the offense.  This
act is distinguished from <i>inducement or instigation </i>wherein the criminal
intent originates in the mind of the instigator and the accused is lured into
the commission of the offense charged in order to prosecute him.  The instigator practically induces the
would-be accused into the commission of the offense and himself becomes a
co-principal."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a number of cases, we have recognized the conduct of buy-bust
operations as an established means of <b>entrapment</b> for the apprehension in
<i>flagrante delicto </i>of persons engaged in illegal drug <span style="">trades.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Hence, the argument of the accused-appellant
that she was </span><span style="">merely </span><span style="">instigated to sell "shabu" does not
hold water.  Moreover, the circumstances
attending her arrest clearly proved her intent to sell "shabu." For
one, at </span>the time of her arrest, she was carrying a ready<span style=""> </span>supply <span style="">of the regulated drug.  Moreover, she immediately made </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">sale when
propositioned by PO2 Corpuz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant also challenges the reliance of the trial court
on the presumption that the police officers who apprehended her regularly
performed their duties.  She cited
alleged irregularities <span style="">in </span>the
course of the conduct of the buy-bust operation.  She avers that the prosecution failed to establish that the
alleged surveillance on her drug trafficking activities and the money used in
the buy-bust operation were annotated in the police blotter.  She also <span style="">maintains that there was no showing that </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">report documenting her
arrest and the cause thereof was ever made since the arrest report itself was
not presented in court.  She urges that
these omissions clearly showed that the arresting officers failed to discharge
their duties regularly.  On this basis,
accused?appellant now claims that she should be exculpated.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Examination of the
evidence shows clearly that after a successful entrapment operation, accused?appellant</span>
was arrested by the police authorities.  At the trial, PO3 Benjamin Placido testified that the corresponding
arrest report was made in connection with accused-appellant's arrest.  He, however, explained that he inadvertently
forgot to bring the arrest report in court.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the prosecution's omission to establish that an entry <span style="">in </span>the police logbook or blotter has
been made regarding the marked money and the surveillance activities on the
accused would not suffice to absolve accused-appellant from liability.  Viewed in the light <span style="">of </span>the entire evidence, the inculpatory fact remains that the
accused-appellant <span style="">was </span>caught in <i><span style="">flagrante </span></i>selling
"shabu." Neither can the trial court be faulted 'for' giving credence
to the testimony of <span style="">the arresting
officers.  No evidence was adduced by
the defense to show that the police authorities harbored any ill-motive against
the accused to charge her with</span> so grave a crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second assigned error, accused-appellant charges that
the identity of the "shabu" sold to the poseur-buyer was not
sufficiently established by the prosecution as the poseur-buyer himself failed
to put identifying marks thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.  The records
will bear that the poseur-buyer positively identified in court Exhibit
"I" <span style="">as </span>the
"shabu" sold to him by the accused-<span style="">appellant.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Although he did not place his initials on
the "shabu" after he received it from the accused?appellant, he
was able to identify it for he personally turned over the "shabu" to
their investigator Pat. Edilberto Sanchez, who, in turn, placed the identifying
mark in his presence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Clearly, then, the identity of the </span><i><span style="">corpus </span></i><i><span style="">delicti</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">has </span><span style="">been duly preserved and established by the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant also underscores the fact that there was no
showing by the prosecution that he had no license or authority to sell
"shabu" which is a regulated drug.  Citing the case of <b><i><span style="">People
v. Pajenado</span></i></b><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
accused-appellant maintains that since the absence of a license or authority is
an essential ingredient of the crime, proof of such negative <span style="">allegation should have been presented by the
prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that if <span style="">a
criminal </span>charge <span style="">is </span>predicated
on a negative allegation, or a negative averment is an essential element of a
crime, the prosecution has the burden to prove the charge.  However, this rule admits of
exceptions.  Where the negative of an
issue does not permit of direct proof, or where the facts are more immediately
within the knowledge of the accused, the <i><span style="">onus probandi </span></i>rests upon <span style="">him.  </span><b><i>Stated
otherwise, it is not incumbent on the prosecution to adduce positive evidence
to support a negative averment the truth of which is fairly indicated by
established circumstances and which, </i></b><b><i><span style="">if </span>untrue, could readily be disproved by the production of
documents or other evidence within the defendant's knowledge or control</i></b>.  For example, where a charge is made that a
defendant carried on a certain business without a license <span style="">(as </span>in the case at bar, where the
accused <span style="">is </span>charged with the sale
of a regulated drug without authority), the fact that he <span style="">has a </span>license <span style="">is </span>a matter which is peculiarly within his knowledge and he must
establish that fact or suffer conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> Even
in the <i><u><span style="">case</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <u>of</u> <u>Pajenado</u></span></i><span style="">, </span>this Court categorically ruled that <b><i>although
the prosecution has the </i></b><b><i><span style="">burden
</span>of proving a negative averment which is an essential element of a crime,
the prosecution, in view of the difficulty of proving a negative allegation,
“need only establish a <u>p</u></i></b><b><i><u><span style="">rima</span></u></i></b><b><i><span style=""> <u>facie</u></span>
case from the best evidence</i></b> <b><i>obtainable.”</i></b><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">In fact, Pajenado was acquitted of the
charge of illegal possession of firearm for the Court found that, in said case,
the prosecution </span>was <span style="">not able to
establish even a </span><i>prima facie</i> case <span style="">upon which to hold him guilty of the crime charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the negative averment that the
accused-appellant had no license or authority to sell "shabu," a
regulated drug, has been fairly indicated by the following circumstances,
deduced from and established by the testimony of the arresting officers, <u>viz</u>:  the accused was caught selling
"shabu" not in a hospital or pharmacy but near a hamburger store,
along a bridge at barangay Caniogan, Pasig, at an unholy hour of 10:00 o'clock
in the evening.  She delivered the drug
to the poseur-buyer PO2 Corpuz and accepted the buy-bust money.  Proof of these circumstances thus shifted
the onus on the accused.  She could have
very easily disproved these damning circumstances by mere presentation of a
copy of her license or any other document evidencing her authority to sell a
regulated drug.  No such thing was done
during the trial.  There is nothing now
to exculpate the accused from liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it should be noted that, for her defense, accused-appellant
relied solely on her uncorroborated testimony.  She did not present her alleged companion, Jorge Alombro,
notwithstanding the presence of the latter at the trial, nor the hamburger
attendant who she claims was initially requested by the police to frisk
her.  On cross-examination,
accused-appellant admitted that she did not file any criminal charge against
the police officers who allegedly manhandled her.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, on the face of the overwhelming evidence against the accused-appellant,
we are constrained to affirm her conviction.</p>
