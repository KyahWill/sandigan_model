Appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch
 XII, Caloocan City, promulgated on August 6, 1976, in Criminal Cases 
Nos. C-6848 (75) and C-6849 (75) convicting herein accused Abelardo 
Balbuena and Juanito Torres for the crime of RAPE and sentencing each of
 them to suffer in each case the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua </em>and to pay the costs.
<p>
The two separate informations dated November 20, 1975 filed by Asst. 
City Fiscal Romeo C. Cortes upon the complaint of the offended party, 
Elvira Polintan, single, 20 years of age, a senior criminology student 
of the Philippine College of Criminology, against the two accused, read 
as follows:
</p><p><em>
CRIMINAL CASE No. C-6848 (75)
</em>
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 28th day of August, 1975, in the City of 
Caloocan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the said accused Abelardo Balbuena y Garcia, conspiring and 
confederating with Juanito Torres y Villanueva, by means of force, did 
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal 
knowledge of the complainant Elvira Polintan against the latter's will 
and consent. </p>
  <p> "Contrary to law."
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p><em>
    CRIMINAL CASE NO. 6849 (75)
</em></p>
<blockquote>
    <p> "That on or about the 28th day of August, 1975, in the City of 
Caloocan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable 
Court, the said accused Juanito Torres y Villanueva, conspiring and 
confederating with Abelardo Balbuena y Garcia, by means of force, did 
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal 
knowledge of the complainant Elvira Polintan against the latter's will 
and consent. </p>
    <p> "Contrary to law."
      </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon arraignment, both accused, assisted by counsel, waived the reading 
of the information and entered the plea of not guilty.  Upon motion of 
the Fiscal, on the ground that the complainant in both cases is one and 
the same person, the court conducted a joint trial of the two cases.
</p><p>
The evidence of the prosecution as summarized in the People's Brief established that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On August 28, 1975, at around 10:00 o'clock in the evening, 
complainant Elvira Polintan was in an apartment located at P. Zamora 
St., Caloocan City, talking with appellant Juanito Torres, a friend of 
long standing (pp. 1-2, t.s.n., Feb. 10, 1976).  After a while, some 
friends of Torres arrived.  Torres and his friends agreed to drink 
liquor.  They invited Elvira Polintan to join them (p. 2, t.s.n., id.). 
 Because Elvira had not seen appellant Torres for quite sometime, she 
accepted the invitation.  They decided to hold the drinking party at the
 apartment of appellant Abelardo Balbuena which was also situated at P. 
Zamora St., Caloocan City, and adjacent to the house of appellant 
Juanito Torres (Ibid.).  The ground floor of Balbuena's apartment was 
formerly a billiard hall but was no longer used as such (p. 10, t.s.n., 
id.).  Inside the billiard hall where the drinking party was held, 
Torres introduced Balbuena to Elvira Polintan (Ibid.).  Aside from the 
two appellants and Elvira Polintan there were three other male persons 
in the group (p. 2, t.s.n., id.).  They drank gin.  (Ibid.) </p>
  <p> "After Elvira Polintan consumed a half glass of gin, she felt 
dizzy (Ibid.).  She asked permission from the group that she would take a
 rest.  She lay down in a bench inside the billiard hall (p. 5, t.s.n., 
Feb. 24, 1976).  Then, appellant Balbuena undressed the complainant by 
removing her pants and briefs (pp. 4, 19, 21, t.s.n., id.) and spread 
her legs wide apart (p. 22, t.s.n., id.).  At this juncture, appellant 
Torres was holding Elvira's hands.  Balbuena then went on top of the 
billiard table (p. 16, t.s.n., Feb. 24, 1976).  In the meantime, 
complainant feebly tried to extricate herself even as appellant Balbuena
 kept on threatening her and her family with death if she would not 
yield her body to him (Ibid.).  Finally, Balbuena succeeded in having 
carnal knowledge with complainant (pp. 22-23, t.s.n,, id.). </p>
  <p> "After appellant Balbuena had satisfied his lustful desires, he 
went down the billiard table.  Immediately thereafter, appellant Torres 
went up the billiard table.  Appellant Balbuena held complainant's hands
 (p. 4, t.s.n., Feb. 16, 1976).  Despite complainant's continued 
struggle by twisting her body and kicking her feet, she simply could not
 overpower the appellants, so that appellant Torres also succeeded in 
consummating the sexual act with her (p. 5, t.s.n., id.).  In the course
 of the sexual act, appellant Balbuena covered the mouth of complainant 
to prevent her from shouting (p. 5, t.s.n., id.).  After she was raped, 
she sat down on the corner and cried.  Appellant Balbuena told her 
â€˜remember what I told you (referring to the threat that he will kill 
complainant and her parents).' (Ibid.).  After about five minutes and 
when the attention of the appellants were distracted, complainant ran 
away and proceeded to her house.  (Ibid.). </p>
  <p> "On October 19, 1975, she related her sad experience to her mother
 (p. 7, t.s.n., Feb. 10, 1976).  The following day, October 20, 1975, 
she went to the police headquarters at Caloocan City and gave a 
statement (Exhibit "A") narrating the incident of August 28, 1975 (p. 6,
 t.s.n., id.).  Also on October 20, 1975, she filed a complaint 
(Exhibits "B" and "C") for rape in the City Fiscal's Office at Caloocan 
City against the appellants. </p>
  <p> "On the same date, complainant was examined by Dr. Maximo Reyes, 
medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation who issued a
 medical certificate (Exhibit "D", p. 46, rec.) with the following 
findings: </p>
  <p>
    'General Physical Examination:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Height: 156 cm.             Weight: 96 lbs.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Breast fully developed, hemispherical and soft.  Areola, dark brown, 3.0 cm. in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      No evident sign of extragenital physical injury noted on the body of the subject.
    </p>
    <p>

  <p>
      CONCLUSIONS:
    </p>
  <blockquote>
      <p>
        1.      No evident sign of extragenital physical injury noted on the body of the subject.
      </p>
      <p> 2.      She could have had sexual intercourse with a man on or about the alleged date of commission.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
Both accused-appellants rest their defense on denial and alibi.
</p><p>
Accused Juanito Torres testified that he had known the complainant for 
the past three years prior to the alleged commission of rape as she used
 to be with him in going places and having occasional drinking sprees of
 beer, gin and coke, "pagka may katuwaan", with a group of male 
companions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> ; that at about 
4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of August 28, 1975, he saw complainant and
 requested her to accompany him to his cousin who resides at Gen. Luna 
Street, Caloocan City, to request his cousin to write a letter for him, 
and she acceded to come along<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 ; that however, he went alone to see his cousin while complainant 
stayed behind at the fire department and then he went home without her 
at about 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
In denying any participation in the rape charge, accused Torres 
disclaimed his presence at the drinking party held inside the billiard 
hall.  He denied that he usually drives a public utility jeepney from 
the corner of 10th Avenue, Rizal Avenue Extension, up to Biglang-Awa 
from 6:00 o'clock in the evening up to 12:00 o'clock midnight.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  He declared further that complainant, a tomboy, had a previous amorous
 relation with his cousin, Rhodora Torres, and that she maintains a 
grudge against him for advising his cousin to part ways with her which 
resulted in the separation of his cousin and the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  He said that after August 28, 1975, he had on seven or nine occasions 
seen the complainant who when greeted simply ignored him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
On the other hand, accused Abelardo Balbuena also denied the accusation 
of rape against him and his participation at the drinking spree with 
complainant.  He testified that he first met complainant upon being 
introduced to each other on August 28, 1975 at his father's billiard 
hall situated at P. Zamora Street, Caloocan City; that after conversing 
with her for about five minutes, he left complainant in the company of 
three male companions and that they had a drinking spree at the billiard
 hall.  They went to the upper floor of their house to eat supper and 
only came down later to ask her and her companions what time they would 
leave the house, to which she answered that it would not take long, and 
immediately thereafter he went upstairs again to do something else.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
As indicated earlier, both accused were found guilty and sentenced in each case to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua </em>and to pay the costs.
</p><p>
Appealing to this Court, accused-appellants submit the following assignment of errors:
</p><p align="center"><em>
I
</em>
</p><p align="center">
The lower court erred in not declaring Elvira Polintan as an incredible 
complaining witness in her narration of being raped by the accused.
</p><p align="center"><em>
II
</em>
</p><p align="center">
The lower court erred in not declaring Elvira Polintan as a willing 
victim in the crime of rape, hence, the element of force is absolutely 
wanting.
</p><p>
In raising the first assigned error, appellants contend that the lower 
court should have declared complainant Elvira Polintan as an incredible 
witness in her narration of being raped by the accused, pointing out 
that there was a delay of more than one month before the incident was 
reported to the police authorities; that complainant used to go with 
male friends, imbibing alcoholic beverages; that no bodily injuries were
 noted in the medical certificate (Exhibit "D"); that her dress or 
underwear was not torn; and that she was able to give a detailed 
description of what transpired during the night including the acts and 
movements of the appellants.
</p><p>
On the question of delay which the defense submits to be construed to 
mean that the Court should doubt the very existence of the commission of
 the crime, We agree and affirm the ruling of the trial court that the 
delay in filing the complaint was reasonable.  The reasoning of the 
Court that "(i)t is not easy for a Filipina to easily decide whether to 
come out in the open in a situation where public contempt and ridicule 
would result in the prosecution of a case.  The very fact that she came 
forward in the case is persuasion that the act had been committed.  The 
complainant stands to gain nothing with her revelation and the 
consequent punishment of the accused," is well-grounded, considering the
 inate modesty of Filipina womanhood and the inherent reluctance of the 
Filipino family to be exposed to the rigors of a long drawn out trial 
scandalizing the family's good name and honor.
</p><p>
It is quite true that the unexplained delay in the filing of a criminal 
complaint for rape may result in an adverse inference against the 
complainant's sincerity and credibility, as in People vs. Pimentel, 118 
SCRA 695, where the formal complaint was lodged against appellant after 
the lapse of 39 days and the Court said it taxes one's credibility that 
complainant could be able, after a long period of time, to feign a 
composed and serene posture after the harrowing experience she had 
undergone.  But that is not true in the instant case.  The victim herein
 has rendered a credible and satisfactory account for her delay in 
reporting the incident to her mother and in seeking the help of the 
authorities.  The complainant unequivocably testified that she was 
fearful over the threats of the accused-appellants that they would kill 
her and her parents should she report the matter to the police, 
especially so since she resides near the houses of the 
accused-appellants and she has to pass their houses in going out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  She also expressed her worry that her ongoing classes at school would be disrupted upon her filing of the complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  The fear and the shock engendered by the threats as well as her desire
 to avoid further shame is more than sufficient to restrain the offended
 party from immediately exposing her sad experience.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
We reject appellantsâ€™ contention that complainant Elvira Polintan is an 
incredible witness because she used to go with male friends, imbibing 
alcoholic beverages.  This is not unusual, considering that complainant 
is admittedly a "tomboy".  As observed by the trial court, the demeanor 
of the complainant at the witness stand shows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Admittedly, the complainant is a 'tomboy'.  Her appearance is 
most revealing.  She is not exactly ugly.  These considerations 
notwithstanding, and perusing the background leading to the incidents in
 question, it cannot be disputed that the two accused were at the time 
of the incident, drunk.  Such being their state, it is not improbable to
 say that the physical appearance of the woman would not bar these 
persons from the commission of the offense." (See CFI Decision) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And neither the absence of any injury being noted in the medical 
certificate nor that her dress or underwear was not torn supports 
appellants' submission that complainant is an incredible witness.  The 
absence of any injury is explained by the fact that the physical 
examination of the victim was made after more than one month had elapsed
 from the commission of the crime and moreover, We find no evidence that
 complainant was injured in her struggle to resist the acts of the 
accused.  And there was no torn dress or underwear because she was then 
wearing pants brief at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
</p><p>
The general rule on the credibility of the victim's testimony in a rape 
case is well-stated in People vs. Pimentel, 118 SCRA 695 where the 
Court, speaking through Justice Escolin, held as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In weighing the testimony of the complainant in an accusation for
 rape, the rule often applied by the courts is that the testimony of the
 victim, whose chastity has not been questioned, is generally accorded 
credence because such offended party would not have fabricated facts 
that could bring shame and dishonor on her.  Nor would she disclose her 
humiliating experience at a public trial, and thus give rise to gossip 
and slander, unless her motive was to bring to justice the person who 
grievously wronged her."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Such a rule has been established because the detestable crime of rape in
 which a man shows his most heinous side is one of the hardest to prove.
  Indeed, the testimony of the victim most often is the only one 
available to prove directly its commission and corroboration by other 
witnesses would in certain cases place a serious doubt as to the 
probability of its commission.  When a woman testifies that she has been
 raped, she says all that need to be said to signify that this crime has
 been committed.  (U.S. vs. Ramos, 1 Phil. 81).
</p><p>
In its decision, the trial court said that it "has gone at length with 
the testimony of Elvira Polintan in order to determine whether the same 
is conclusive, logical and probable.  The complainant when she testified
 before the court to narrate what had happened on the night of August 
28, 1975, appeared to be credible as a witness, and her account of the 
incident likewise left in the judicial mind an affirmative answer 
whether a woman of complainant's stature could be the object of this 
heinous offense." The court further added:  "Then too, the complainant 
narrated the incident in a straight forward and convincing manner and 
despite the lengthy cross-examination to which she has been put too, she
 was steadfast in the fact that she was the victim of rape.  Moreover, 
the very fact that she came out forward in this case is in itself a 
silent but persuasive evidence of an outrage done upon her honor.  
Considering these evidences on record, there is nothing in the defense 
evidence which points out convincingly why Elvira Polintan should 
corrupt the truth and put the lives of these two accused in jeopardy."
</p><p>
This finding of the trial court on the credibility of the complaining 
witness is entitled to the highest respect upon this Tribunal, and We 
will not disturb the same.
</p><p>
Moreover, We find no reason, and none is advanced by appellant Balbuena 
why complainant should implicate him in the case considering that he 
came to know the complainant for the first time during the incident.  
The motive imputed by appellant Torres to the complainant in implicating
 the appellant in the charge of rape which is that Torres told his 
cousin, Rhodora Torres, to sever her relationship with complainant, is 
indeed too flimsy to be accepted because the crime of rape exposes not 
only the accused but also the complainant to public ridicule and shame.
</p><p>
We agree with the trial court in its conclusion that "(t)he sum total of
 all the foregoing considerations is the fact that the court believes 
that essential elements constitutive of the crime of rape had been 
established by the prosecution peradventure of doubt."
</p><p>
The defense of the accused is one of denial as pointed out earlier in 
this decision, which is inherently weak, and more than that, the 
testimony of the accused Torres that he was with the complainant on 
August 28, 1975 at about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon and not in the 
evening, is itself belied by the other accused Balbuena who admitted 
that Torres was present at the drinking spree on August 28, 1975.  And 
in addition to the above contradiction, the defense of the accused is 
wanting in material corroboration.
</p><p>
As to the second assigned error, We find the same to be without merit.  
Complainant is a "tomboy" and as such, she is sexually attracted to 
persons of her own sex rather than to the male specie.  She would not 
willingly submit herself to a sexual intercourse with a male person as 
suggested by the appellants.  The evidence is clear that appellants 
employed force in consumating the crime of rape.  From the bench where 
she was lying down, she was pulled to the billiard table and bodily 
raised on top of the table where she was forced to lie down.  Both 
accused held her at the wrist and one of them held her by the feet.  She
 fought and struggled with them (nagpapapalag).  On top of the billiard 
table, Torres held both of her hands while Balbuena laid on top of her 
and sexually abused her.  After that, Balbuena went down from the table 
and Torres climbed while the other held both of the victim's hands and 
similarly, Torres was able to rape her.
</p><p>
That the guilt of the accused for the crime of rape has been proved 
beyond reasonable doubt is clear and the decision being in accordance 
with law and the evidence, the same must be affirmed.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the judgment of conviction 
against the accused-appellants Abelardo Balbuena y Garcia and Juanito 
Torres y Villanueva and the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua </em>in Criminal Case No. C-6848 and Criminal Case No. C-6849 for each of the accused is hereby AFFIRMED.  Costs de oficio.
SO ORDERED.

DISSENTING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
ABAD SANTOS, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
Elvira Polintan was 20 years old in August, 1975.  By her own testimony 
she joined a group of men in a former billiard hall for the purpose of 
drinking "cuatro cantos" gin.  All the men, except for appellant Juanito
 Torres, were apparently strangers to her.  Is this normal behaviour for
 a Filipino woman of her age?  I do not think so.  The Filipino woman as
 a rule is an abstainer even after she has reached maturity.  I have to 
conclude that Elvira's conduct casts a dark cloud on her claim that she 
was raped successively by Torres and Abelardo Balbuena.
</p><p>
If in fact there was sex, "It could very well be that the euphoric feeling induced by this young girl's imbibing <em>tuba </em>wine
 led to the relaxation of what could be inhibiting factors." (People vs.
 Joven, L-36022, May 22, 1975, 64 SCRA 126, 128.) In other words if 
there was sex, it was with Elvira's consent.  Other circumstances 
support the consensual view:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.    There was no determined resistance by Elvira nor did she shout
 for help considering that there were other persons in the premises.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.    She had no signs of extragenital injury nor any kind of injury
 for that matter.  While it is true that there can be a conviction for 
rape even absent signs of injury still there must be other convincing 
evidence.  In the case at bar there is nom other than the say so of the 
complainant.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.    The unreasonable delay in the filing of the complaint against 
the appellants.  One month and 23 days elapsed before Elvira complained 
that she had been raped and her lame excuse for the delay was that she 
was threatened with death by the appellants which she ignored after all.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is usually said in rape cases that the Filipino woman is modest and 
shy so that she will not publicly complain of having been raped and 
thereby expose herself to shame and ridicule unless she was in fact 
raped.  I accept this proposition - for a typical Filipino woman.  But 
Elvira is not a typical Filipino woman.  Not yet 21 she was already a 
guzzler, not just of ladies' drinks, but of full-strength distilled 
spirits like gin.
</p><p>
The appellants have put up the defense of denial and alibi.  This 
defense can well be rejected but it does not follow that they are 
guilty.  For it is elementary that the prosecution must rely on the 
strength of its evidence and not on the weakness of the defense.  In the
 instant case I do not believe that the prosecution has overcome the 
presumption of innocence which the law accords to the accused.
</p><p>
I vote for acquittal.
