				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is another instance of how alcoholism can blur a person's
reason and judgment, fill him with blind rage and spur a demented attack
against his own flesh and blood.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around half past eight in the evening of December 20, 1989,
fifty-three year old Dioscoro Quiño sprawled dead amidst rice paddies some fifteen
meters from his house in Poblacion, Danao, Bohol, leaving behind his wife and a
brood of seven sons and nine daughters.  He had two stab wounds in his body - one fatal, penetrating his left
chest and the other piercing his left buttock.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the shocking revelation that he had wounded his own father,
Daniel Quiño fled the scene of the incident.  Straightaway, he surrendered to the police authorities and was
incarcerated.  He was informed later
that his father <span style="">had expired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that Dioscoro Quiño was killed by his own
twenty-four year old son Daniel, herein accused-appellant, who now admits
having done so with remorse and despair.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused was charged with parricide before the Regional Trial
Court Branch 4, Tagbilaran, Bohol, in an Information which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 29th day of December, 1989 at barangay
Poblacion, municipality of Davao, province of Bohol, Philippines, and within
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being the
legitimate son of Dioscoro Quiño and Lucia Ando, with intent to kill and
without justifiable motive, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously attack, assault and stab with a sharp-pointed weapon his father
Dioscoro Quiño, thereby inflicting mortal wounds on the vital parts of the
victim's body which directly caused the instantaneous death of the victim, to
the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the victim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Acts committed contrary to the provision of Art. 246 of the Revised
Penal Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>City of Tagbilaran, February 12, 1990."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused, assisted by counsel, pleaded not
guilty to the crime charged, invoking self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the court heard the case, the prosecution presented only one
witness in the person of Dra. Benita Mar y Tan, municipal health officer of
Daghoy, Bohol, who conducted the post-mortem examination on the cadaver of
Dioscoro Quiño.  She issued a Post
Mortem Examination Report which in part reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Findings:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x 1.   Stab wound, 5.5
cm. run away from the sternum, 3.0 cm. from the left nipple, located below the
5th rib, left, deep, penetrating, measuring 1.0 cm. in width, 2.5 cm. in length
and 144.0 cm. in depth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Stab wound at the left buttock, measuring 1.0 cm. in length and
5.0 cm. in depth.  x x x."<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other witnesses for the prosecution - the victim's widow and
mother of the accused, Lucia Ando, and their neighbor Nestor Alajid, who
earlier issued written statements derogatory to the accused Daniel Quiño during
preliminary investigation before the Danao Municipal Trial Court judge,
suddenly left for Mindanao and could not be presented in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented three witnesses:  the accused himself, Paterno Melecio y Betinol and Zenon Acaba.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant testified that on December 29, 1989 which was the
vesper day of the town fiesta, he travelled the six-kilometer stretch from
where he lived in Magtangtang, Danao, passing by friends' houses to Poblacion,
Danao where his father lived; that he reached his father's house at around 8:00
o'clock in the evening and allegedly found the latter drunk, entertaining a
guest, Paping Melecio, in the frontyard; that his brothers and <span style="">sisters were around at the time; that when he
informed his father that he wanted to borrow their carabao, his father, while
refusing to lend the work animal, got a piece of wood measuring 2 x 2 x 24
inches and beat him with it.  He was hit
once at the back near the nape and to avoid trouble, he allegedly ran to the
rice paddies.  His father pursued him,
still holding the piece of wood.  When
he had traversed some fifteen (15) meters, his father caught up with him and
hit him again, this time hitting him at the back shoulder near his neck,
causing him to fall to the ground.  While in that position, his father beat him again hitting the upper part
of his nape.  The accused quickly pulled
out his hunting knife and swung it from side to side to fend off his father's
attacks.  When, as a result of his
moves, his father fell to the ground, he got scared, then drew the knife and
ran away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, the accused declared that he did not <span style="">see </span>Nestor Alajid in his father's house
on the night of the incident; that he did not submit himself to an examination;
and that none of those then present pacified or prevented his father from using
the piece of wood on him because they allegedly knew that their father would
not recognize anyone, as he had beaten everyone, including his own mother, many
times in the past, when drunk.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witness Paterno Melecio partly corroborated the testimony
of the accused, declaring that on the night of the crime, he arrived at the
house of the deceased ahead of the accused; that Dioscoro's children were
around so there were no other visitors; that when the accused arrived and
expressed his desire to borrow Dioscoro's carabao, the deceased got a piece of
wood and struck the accused; that he did not know what transpired after the
deceased chased his son as he was old and could not follow them to the paddies;
that the wife of the deceased later told him that her husband was stabbed by
their son Daniel.<i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Zenon Acaba, son-in-law of the deceased, testified that no one in
the family was interested in pursuing the case and that his mother-in-law Lucia
had executed an affidavit of desistance because she pitied her own son who also
has a family to support.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 9, 1992, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>rendered
a decision <span style="">finding the accused guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of <u>parricide</u> as defined and
penalized under Art. 246 of the Revised Penal Code, sentencing him to suffer
the penalty of reclusion perpetua with all its accessory penalties and to
indemnify the victim's heirs in the sum of P50,000.00 plus costs.  Hence, this recourse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the accused invokes the justifying circumstance of
self-defense, he assumes the burden of proving with clear and convincing
evidence, the justification of his act.  Having admitted the killing, he must then establish his claim by clear
and convincing proof, relying on the strength of his own evidence and not on
the weakness of the prosecution, for even if it were weak, it could not be
disbelieved after the accused admitted the killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The essential elements of self-defense are:  (a) unlawful aggression; (b) reasonable
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (c) lack of
sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>agree with the
lower court's finding that there was no unlawful aggression on account of the
fact that appellant did not sustain a single minor injury despite the alleged
"repeated blows" with a piece of wood by the victim.  He was not even bruised or dazed despite
alleged hard blows on his neck and shoulder.  Furthermore, it would have been the accused, and not the victim, who
would be irked or angered by the father's refusal to lend the carabao.  Even then, if it were also true that the
accused was simply brandishing his hunting knife by swinging it from side to
side, the knife would not have caused a deep and penetrating wound which had to
be drawn out from his father's chest, as shown by his testimony in open court
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:  </span>Was
there any other way to prevent him from hitting you except that getting your
knife by brandishing?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:  No </span>other way.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:  Why did you say so?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:  No more, he was already fallen and I drew
the knife and went away."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court will no longer discuss the other elements of
self-defense, it having been convincingly established that there was lack of
unlawful aggression and, therefore, there cannot be any self-defense, complete
or incomplete.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are perplexed why the accused, who claimed that "he did
not wish to have any further encounter with his father," ran away from the
house "in an ordinary way just like jogging exercise."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
If his father were really as drunk as he pictured him to be at the time, he
could have easily thrown his father out of balance, drew him aside, or sped
away beyond reach.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are also other material inconsistencies in appellant's
testimony, placing his candor and credibility in question.  For one, he stated on direct examination
that when he threatened his father with his hunting knife, he had already
fallen on the ground, having been beaten by his father, but on
cross-examination he testified that he was not lying down but was instead
standing up, even demonstrating his action.  The lower court, in its decision, categorically stated that "the
scenario depicted by the accused is of doubtful veracity."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy report reveals that the victim sustained two (2) stab
wounds - one penetrating deeply on the left chest and the other, five cm. deep
on the left buttock.  Both could not
have been sustained by the mere swinging of appellant's knife from side to
side.  Moreover, there is no evidence as
to when the second wound was inflicted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Rivera</u>, G.R No.
101798, May 10, 1993, 221 SCRA 647, citing <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Bigkas</u>,
<u>et</u> <u>al</u>., 211 SCRA 631, G.R. No. 94524, July 20, 1992, we held
that:</p>

<blockquote>"In the present case, the number of wounds, the point of entry
of the second wound, the position of the victim in relation to the assailant
when the second wound was inflicted, as well as the fact that appellant did not
sustain any injury, conjointly belie any pretension of self-defense.  The nature and the number of wounds
inflicted by an assailant are constantly and unremittingly considered important
incidents which disprove a plea of self-defense."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Evidence to be believed must, not only proceed from the mouth of
a credible witness (which alone is already doubtful in the case at bench), but
must be credible in itself, such that the common experience and observation of
man can approve as probable under the circumstances.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, appellant not only failed to prove unlawful aggression
for his testimony lacked credibility but the evidence decidedly shows the
absence thereof.</p>
