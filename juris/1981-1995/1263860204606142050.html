rendered on <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="8">31 August 1978</st1:date>
by the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch VI

Isaac <span class="SpellE">Soco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leoncia</span> <span class="SpellE">Soco</span>." The said case was a complaint for recovery of a

<p class="BODY">The respondent court's decision of <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="8">31 August 1978</st1:date> was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in a
decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

on <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="1">26 January 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, private respondents (as
defendants) filed with the respondent court a motion for the issuance of a writ
of demolition of the improvements erected by plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Susons</span>
on the subject property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, at the
hearing of said motion for demolition, it surfaced that herein petitioner, Luis
<span class="SpellE">Suson</span>, who was not a party to the case, had his house
standing on a Portion of the subject lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court thereupon issued an order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="9">27 September 1982</st1:date><a style="mso-footnote-id:

which petitioner, however, failed to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For such failure to file the complaint in intervention, the respondent
court ordered petitioner on <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="10">20

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a motion to hold in abeyance compliance with the
demolition order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another order of

Petitioner's urgent motion to suspend the writ was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, plaintiffs’ motion for relief from

The action was for quieting of title to a portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiffs in Civil Case No. R-14351, including herein petitioner

the case was remanded to the Court of Appeals for prompt execution by the
proper court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with this Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="12">3 December 1986</st1:date>, respondent court,
presided over by Judge Ramon Am. Torres, ordered on <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="2">23 February 1987</st1:date> in Civil Case No. R-14351 the

However, upon motion of herein petitioner Luis <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>
in Civil Case No. R-22651 (where he was the plaintiff), Judge Leonardo B. <span class="SpellE">Canares</span> of Branch X, RTC of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
issued an order, dated 11 March 1987, restraining the sheriff from enforcing
the alias writ of execution issued in Civil Case No. R-14351 by the respondent
court against petitioner, until the issues in Civil Case No. R-22651 shall have

Private respondents thereupon filed before Judge Ramon Am. Torres in Civil Case

<p class="BODY">In his present recourse, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Suson</span>

order of demolition directed against him, dated <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="10">20 October 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in Civil Case No. R-22651, Branch X of the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> issued an order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="5">8 May 1987</st1:date> dismissing herein
petitioner's complaint in said case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed with this Court a Supplementary Pleading
seeking also relief from said Order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="5">8 May 1987</st1:date> of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch X, dismissing his complaint in said Civil Case
No. R-22651.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue to be resolved here is whether on not the
respondent Regional Trial Court (Branch VI) acted with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction, or acted in excess of its jurisdiction, when
it issued the order dated 20 October 1982 in Civil Case No. R-14351 ordering
petitioner to demolish his house on the questioned lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">As mentioned earlier in this decision, after the respondent,
court found during the hearing of the private respondents' motion for
demolition that petitioner had his house erected on the disputed property, the
Court ordered the petitioner, who was not a party to the action, to file a
complaint in intervention to guide the court in disposing of the motion for
execution (demolition).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be remembered
also that the Motion was filed for the execution of the decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="8">31 August 1978</st1:date> of the respondent
court which had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> after
appeal had been unsuccessfully taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by the
plaintiffs in the case to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that when the respondent trial court in Civil
Case No. R-14351 ordered him to intervene at the execution stage of its
judgment and when, because of his failure to do so, said court ordered his
house demolished, this was tantamount to erroneously amending and altering a
decision (31 August 1978) that had become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot
be overlooked that the hearing before the respondent court on the motion for
demolition was in connection with the implementation or execution of a final
judgment in Civil Case No. R-14351.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was precisely given an opportunity to intervene in order to
guide the court in disposing of private respondents' motion for demolition in
the light of petitioner's claim that his house was erected on the disputed lot,
and yet, he was not an original party to the action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was thus given a chance to raise
and prove his claim of ownership over a part of the lot in question, but he
ignored such opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot now
complain that he was denied due process. "A case in which an execution has
been issued is regarded as still pending so that all proceedings on the
execution are proceedings in the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no question that the court which rendered the judgment has a general
supervisory control over its process of execution, and this power carries with
it the right to determine every question of fact and law which may be involved
in the execution."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this Court has already ruled that a writ of execution
may be issued against a person not a party to a case where the latter's remedy,
which he did not avail of, was to intervene in the case in question involving
rights over the same parcel of land.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the respondent court acted within its power when it
issued the Order of <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="10">20 October 1982</st1:date>
directing the demolition of petitioner's house after he failed to intervene in
the case despite notice to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, by petitioner's act of joining the plaintiffs in Civil Case
No. R-14351, when the latter appealed the respondent court's orders (which included
the demolition order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="10">20 October
 1982</st1:date>) to the Court of Appeals, and later, to this Court, petitioner
placed himself within the jurisdiction of the respondent court and thereby
bound himself to its judgment and orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is also no dispute that the assailed decision of the
respondent court, dated <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="8">31 August 1978</st1:date>,
had become final and, therefore, its execution cannot be postponed or deferred
by the respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to Civil Case No. R-22651 the separate action filed
by petitioner against the private respondents before Branch X of the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The question to be resolved here is: whether substantially the same
evidence presented in the first action, i.e. Civil Case No. R-14351 would
support and establish the complaint's cause of action in the second case.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the record and the arguments prof­fered by
petitioner clearly indicates that no really new substantial issues and evidence
in support thereof are raised in the second action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with private respondents that the
parties in both actions are the same:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
the subject matter is the same, i.e. <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2051, Plan
11-5121 covered by OCT 562, while the causes of action are basically identical
in both actions, such that the second action is barred by prior judgment (in
the first action) or <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span><u>.</u>
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It has been held that:</p>

<blockquote>"Although postulated in a slightly different form, the present
action is barred by the final order of dismissal in Case No. 4731, ‘since a
party can not, by varying his form of action or adopting a different method of
presenting his case, escape the effects of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> (<span class="SpellE">Cayco</span> v. Cruz, L-12663,
August 21, 1959; Aguirre v. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, L-10665, Aug.
30, 1958; <span class="SpellE">Labarro</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Labitoria</span>,

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, we see no compelling reason to
resuscitate issues which have long been laid to rest by discussing them
anew.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch X, acted correctly in dismissing petitioner's
complaint in Civil Case No. R-22651.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Order of the respondent court dated <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="10">20 October 1982</st1:date> is again AFFIRMED.</p>
