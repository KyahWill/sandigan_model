proposing constitutional <span class="GramE">amendments,</span> goes further than
merely assailing their alleged constitutional infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners Samuel <span class="SpellE">Occena</span>
and Ramon A. Gonzales, both members of the Philippine Bar and former delegates
to the 1971 Constitutional Convention that framed the present Constitution, are
suing as taxpayers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rather
unorthodox aspect of these petitions is the assertion that the 1973
Constitution is not the fundamental law, the <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
ruling to the contrary notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To put it at its mildest, such an approach has the arresting charm of
novelty - but nothing else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in
fact self defeating, for if such were indeed the case, petitioners have come to
the wrong forum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sit as a Court
duty-bound to uphold and apply that Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To contend otherwise as was done here would
be, quite clearly, an exercise in futility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor are the arguments of petitioners cast in the traditional form of constitutional
litigation any more persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
reasons to be set forth, we dismiss the petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The suits for prohibition were filed respectively on March 6<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

On March 10 and 13 respectively, respondents were required to answer each
within ten days from notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a comment on the part of the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, both cases were set for hearing
and were duly argued on March 26 by petitioners and Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza for respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the submission of pertinent data in
amplification of the oral argument, the cases were deemed submitted for
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the ruling of the Court, as set forth at the outset, that
the petitions must be dismissed.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->It is much too late in the day to deny the force
and applicability of the 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> v. The Executive Secretary,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissing petitions for prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> to declare invalid its
ratification, this Court stated that it did so by a vote of six<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to four.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> It
then concluded:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This being the
vote of the majority, there is no further judicial obstacle to the new
Constitution being considered in force and effect."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Such a statement served a useful purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It could even be said that there was a need for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It served to clear the atmosphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made manifest that as of <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>, the present
Constitution came into force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With such a pronouncement by the Supreme Court and with the recognition
of the cardinal postulate that what the Supreme Court says is not only entitled
to respect but must also be obeyed, a factor for instability was removed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, as a matter of law, all doubts
were resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1973 Constitution is
the fundamental law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is as simple as
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What cannot be too strongly
stressed is that the function of judicial review has both a positive and a
negative aspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was so convincingly
demonstrated by Professors Black<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and Murphy,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the Supreme Court can check as well as legitimate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In declaring what the law is, it may not only
nullify the acts of coordinate branches but may also sustain their
validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case, there is
an affirmation that what was done cannot be stigmatized as constitutionally
deficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere dismissal of a suit
of this character suffices. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>That is the
meaning of the concluding statement in <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then, this Court has invariably applied
the present Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latest
case in point is People v. <span class="SpellE">Sola</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
promulgated barely two weeks ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
the first year alone of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
present Constitution, at least ten cases may be cited.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->We come to the crucial issue, the power of the <u>Interim</u>
<span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> to
propose amendments and how it may be exercised.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More specifically as to the latter, the extent of the changes that may
be introduced, the number of votes necessary for the validity of a proposal,
and the standard required for a proper submission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was stated earlier, petitioners were
unable to demonstrate that the challenged resolutions are tainted by
unconstitutionality.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The existence of the power of the <u>Interim</u>
<span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> is
indubitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicable provision in
the 1976 Amendments is quite explicit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Insofar as pertinent it reads thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The <u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> shall have the same powers and its Members shall
have the same functions, responsibilities, rights, privileges, and disqualifications
as the <u>interim</u> National Assembly and the regular National Assembly and
the Members thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
One of such powers is precisely that of proposing amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1973 Constitution in its Transitory
Provisions vested the Interim National Assembly with the power to propose
amendments upon special call by the Prime Minister by a vote of the majority of
its members to be ratified in accordance with the Article on Amendments.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
When, therefore, the <u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>, upon the call of the President and Prime Minister
Ferdinand E. Marcos, met as a constituent body, it acted by virtue of such competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its authority to do so is clearly beyond
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could and did propose the
amendments embodied in the resolutions now being assailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be observed parenthetically that as
far as petitioner <span class="SpellE">Occena</span> is concerned, the question
of the authority of the <u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> to propose amendments is not new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Occena</span> v.
Commission on Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
filed by the same petitioner, decided on <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1980</st1:date>, such a question was involved although
not directly passed upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from
the opinion of the Court penned by Justice Antonio in that case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Considering that the proposed amendment
to Section 7 of Article X of the Constitution extending the retirement of
members of the Supreme Court and judges of inferior courts from sixty-five (65)
to seventy (70) years is but a restoration of the age of retirement provided in
the 1935 Constitution and has been intensively and extensively discussed at the
<u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>,
as well as through the mass media, it cannot, therefore, be said that our
people are unaware of the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed
amendment."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Petitioners would urge upon us the proposition
that the amendments proposed are so extensive in character that they go far
beyond the limits of the authority conferred on the <u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> as successor of
the <u>Interim</u> National Assembly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For them, what was done was to revise and not to amend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices to quote from the opinion of
Justice <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, speaking for the Court, in Del
Rosario v. Commission on Elections<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
to dispose of this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And whether the Constitutional Convention will only propose amendments
to the Constitution or entirely overhaul the present Constitution and propose
an entirely new Constitution based on an ideology foreign to the democratic
system, is of no moment; because the same will be submitted to the people for
ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once ratified by the
sovereign people, there can be no debate about the validity of the new
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the present Constitution may be
revised and replaced with a new one * * * is no argument against the validity
of the law because 'amendment' includes the 'revision' or total overhaul of the
entire Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
whether the Constitution is merely amended in part or revised or totally
changed would become immaterial the moment the same is ratified by the
sovereign people."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
There is here the adoption of the principle <span class="GramE">so</span>
well-known in American decisions as well as legal texts that a constituent body
can propose anything but conclude nothing.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
We are not disposed to deviate from such a principle not only sound in theory
but also advantageous in practice.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That leaves only the questions of the vote
necessary to propose amendments as well as the standard for proper
submission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, petitioners have not
made out a case that calls for a judgment in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The language of the Constitution supplies the
answer to the above questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>Interim</u>
<span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>, sitting
as a constituent body, can propose amendments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that capacity, only a majority vote is needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be on indefensible proposition to
assert that the three-fourth votes required when it sits as a legislative body
applies as well when it has been convened as the agency through which amendments
could be proposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is not a requirement
as far as a constitutional convention is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a requirement either when, as in
this case, the <u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> exercises its constituent power to propose
amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even on the
assumption that the requirement of three-fourth votes applies, such
extraordinary majority was obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is not disputed that Resolution No. 1 proposing an amendment allowing a
natural-born citizen of the Philippines naturalized in a foreign country to own
a limited area of land for residential purposes was approved by the vote of 122
to 5; Resolution No. 2 dealing with the Presidency, the Prime Minister and the
Cabinet, and the National Assembly by a vote of 147 to 5 with 1 abstention; and
Resolution No. 3 on the amendment to the Article on the Commission on Elections
by a vote of 148 to 2 with 1 abstention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Where then is the alleged infirmity?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to the requisite standard for a proper submission, the question may
be viewed not only from the standpoint of the period that must elapse before
the holding of the plebiscite but also from the standpoint of such amendments
having been called to the attention of the people so that it could not
plausibly be maintained that they were properly informed as to the proposed
changes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the period, the
Constitution indicates the way the matter should be resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no ambiguity to the applicable
provision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Any amendment to, or
revision of, this Constitution shall be valid when ratified by a majority of
the votes cast in a plebiscite which shall be held not later than three months
after the approval of such amendment or revision."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The three resolutions were approved by the <u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> sitting as a constituent assembly on
February 5 and 27, 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22, the date of the plebiscite is set for <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus within the 90-day period provided
by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus any argument
to the contrary is unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for
the people being adequately informed, it cannot be denied that this time, as in
the cited 1980 <span class="SpellE">Occena</span> opinion of Justice Antonio,
where the amendment restored to seventy the retirement age of members of the
judiciary, the proposed amendments have "been intensively and extensively
discussed at the <u>Interim</u> <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>, as well as through the mass media, [so that] it
cannot, therefore, be said that our people are unaware of the advantages and

<p class="BODY">I vote to give due course to the petitions at bar and to grant

on the invalidity of the October 1976 amendments proposals to the 1973
Constitution for not having been proposed nor adopted in accordance with the
mandatory provisions thereof, as restated by me in <u>Hidalgo vs. Marcos</u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

questioning the validity of the December 17, 1977 referendum-exercise as to the
continuance in office as incumbent President and to be Prime Minister after the
organization of the Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> as provided for in Amendment No. 3 of the 1976
Amendments, I am constrained to dissent from the majority decision of dismissal
of the petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">I had held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sanidad</u></span> that the
transcendental constituent power to propose and approve amendments to the
Constitution as well as to set up the machinery and prescribe the procedure for
the ratification of the amendments proposals has been withheld by the
Constitution from the President (Prime Minister) as sole repository of
executive power and that so long as the regular National Assembly provided for
in Article VIII of the Constitution had not come to existence and the proposals
for constitutional amendments were now deemed necessary to be discussed and
adopted for submittal to the people, strict adherence with the mandatory
requirements of the amending process as provided in the Constitution must be
complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This means, under the
prevailing doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that the proposed amendments to be valid must come from the constitutional
agency vested with the constituent power to do so, i.e. in the Interim National
Assembly provided in the Transitory Article XVII which would then have to be
convened and not from the executive power as vested in the President (Prime
Minister) from whom such constituent power has been withheld.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->As restated by me in the 1977 case of <u>Hidalgo</u>,
under the controlling doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span>,
the October 1976 constitutional amendments which created the Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> in lieu of the
Interim National Assembly were invalid since as ruled by the Court therein,
constitutional provisions on amendments "dealing with the procedure or
manner of amending the fundamental law are binding upon the Convention and the
other departments of the government (and) are no less binding upon the
people" and "the very idea of departing from the fundamental law is
anachronistic in the realm of constitutionalism and repugnant to the essence of
the rule of law." The proposed amendments at bar having been adopted by
the Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
as the fruit of the invalid October, 1976 amendments must necessarily suffer
from the same congenital infirmity.</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the foregoing
and assuming the validity of the proposed amendments, I reiterate my stand in <span class="SpellE"><u>Sanidad</u></span> that the doctrine of fair and proper
submission first enunciated by a simple majority of six Justices (of an
eleven-member Court prior to the 1973 Constitution which increased the official
composition of the Court to fifteen) in <u>Gonzales vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and subsequently officially adopted by the required constitutional two-thirds
majority vote of the Court (of eight votes, then) in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tolentino</u></span>
is fully applicable in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The three resolutions proposing complex, complicated and radical
amendments of our very structure of government were considered and approved by
the Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
sitting as a constituent assembly on <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It set the date of
the plebiscite for thirty-nine days later on April 7, 1981 which is totally
inadequate and far short of the ninety-day period fixed by the Constitution for
submittal to the people to "sufficiently inform them of the amendments to
be voted upon, to conscientiously deliberate thereon and to express their will
in a genuine manner."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->"The minimum requirements that must be met
in order that there can be a proper submission to the people of a proposed
constitutional amendment" as stated by retired Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
V. Sanchez in his separate opinion in <u>Gonzales</u> bears repeating as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> we take the view that the words 'submitted to the
people for their ratification,' if construed in the light of the nature of the
Constitution - a fundamental charter that is legislation direct from the
people, an expression of their sovereign will - is that it can only be amended
by the people expressing themselves according to the procedure ordained by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, amendments must be fairly laid
before the people for their blessing or spurning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The people are not to be mere rubber
stamps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not to vote blindly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They must be afforded ample opportunity to
mull over the original provisions, compare them with the proposed amendments,
and try to reach a conclusion as the dictates of their conscience suggest, free
from the incubus of extraneous or possibly insidious influences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe the word 'submitted' can only mean
that the government, within its maximum capabilities, should strain every
effort to inform every citizen of the provisions to be amended, and the
proposed amendments and the meaning, nature and effects thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> What the Constitution in effect directs is that the
government, in submitting an amendment for ratification, should put every
instrumentality or agency within its structural framework to enlighten the
people, educate them with respect to their act of ratification or
rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as we have earlier
stated, one thing is submission and another is ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be fair submission, intelligent
consent or rejection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If with all these
safeguards the people still approve the amendments no matter how prejudicial it
is to them, then so be it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the
people decree their own fate."</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Sanchez therein ended the passage with an apt citation
that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The great
men who <span class="SpellE">builded</span> the structure of our state in this
respect had the mental vision of a good Constitution voiced by Judge Cooley,
who has said 'A good Constitution should be beyond the reach of temporary
excitement and popular caprice or passion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is needed for stability and steadiness; it must yield to the thought
of the people; not to the whim of the people, or the thought evolved in excitement
or hot blood, but the sober second thought, which alone, if the government is
to be safe, can be allowed efficacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Changes in government are to
be feared unless the benefit is certain.' <span class="GramE">As <span class="SpellE">Montaign</span> says:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'All
great mutations shake and disorder a state.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good does not necessarily succeed evil;
another evil may succeed and a worse.'"</p>
