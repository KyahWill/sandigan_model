Bangbang, Municipality of Matalam, North Cotabato, having loaded earlier <i>palay</i> on their 3/4-ton truck at Bo. New Alimodian, Danilo Peñon and his co-workers Juaning, "Do" and "Odo" were proceeding to Bo. Buroburoan where their employer, Merto Pedregosa, was residing, when they were caught by rain in Bo. Bangbang, compelling them to take shelter there in the house of Antonio Ganaan (TSN, pp. 4-6, Dec. 3, 1970).<br><br>In the house were Antonio Ganaan and his wife, Martina, Ganaan.&nbsp; Once inside, Peñon, "Odo" and "Do" rested themselves on the sacks of <i>palay</i> on the ground floor of the 2-story house.&nbsp; Peñon's other companion, Juaning, driver of the 3/4-ton truck, conversed with the spouses Antonio and Martina.&nbsp; Not long after, three (3) armed men barged through the kitchen, saying:&nbsp; “This is holdup”.&nbsp; Pointing their guns at Peñon and Antonio Ganaan, the intruders ordered Peñon, his companions, Juaning, "Do", "Odo", and the spouses Antonio and Martina Ganaan to lie on the ground, faces down; and tied their hands at the back with abaca (TSN, pp. 6-9, <i>Id.</i>).<br><br>Peñon saw the intruders by a petromax light.&nbsp; From his position, he turned his face towards them, prompting one of them, Wennie Aguhayon, to kick his face.&nbsp; He was able to recognize three of them, Wennie Aguhayon, Julito Dava and Nonito Galido, as their masks were already removed by that time.&nbsp; Martina Ganaan tried to run away but was pursued and overtaken by two of the in­truders.&nbsp; She was brought back, tied, and made to lie near the place where Peñon, his companions, and a laborer of the spouses lay tied (TSN, pp. 10-11, <i>Id.</i>).<br><br>Martina Ganaan ran after hearing the three intruders say that her son Itoy was already dead.&nbsp; After four of the in­truders took Antonio Ganaan upstairs, banging noises, including sounds of trunks and aparador being opened, were heard.&nbsp; As Peñon, Martina Ganaan, and the others were on the floor tied, stabbings followed.&nbsp; Peñon himself was stabbed thrice.&nbsp; He heard his companions' groanings, possibly in death throes.&nbsp; Although stabbed, he dared not move.&nbsp; He was able to observe, however, the intruders get canned goods, and heard one of them say:&nbsp; "Get back because we'll place them in­side the sack" (TS, pp. 11-13, <i>Id.</i>).<br><br>Those four other intruders with Antonio Ganaan stayed upstairs for about 4 minutes.&nbsp; Peñon heard Antonio Ganaan groan in pain, after which the intruders came down.&nbsp; He saw the faces of those four (4) men who brought Antonio Ganaan upstairs, namely, Hermosisimo Galido, Mansueto Casino (not Mansueto Villahermosa), and Calixto Casino.&nbsp; All seven (7) intruders then left carrying sacks of canned goods.&nbsp; Before leaving, they put out the petromax light (TSN, pp. 14-17, <i>Id.</i>).<br><br>Peñon then freed himself by rub­bing the abaca fibers against something.&nbsp; He knew that the intruders left because they fired shots outside.&nbsp; One of them uttered:&nbsp; "Come.&nbsp; Let's go home.&nbsp; They are all dead.&nbsp; None of them is alive" (TSN, pp. 17-18, 21, <i>Id.</i>).&nbsp; It was Wennie Aguhayon who stabbed him.&nbsp; Lito Dava stabbed his three companions, Juaning, "Odo" and "Do".&nbsp; He did not actually see who stabbed the spouses Antonio and Martina, her companions and another one who was brought upstairs by the intruders (TSN, pp. 22-23, <i>Id.</i>).<br><br>Dr. Cesar R.

Suffice it to state that Peñon was present throughout the incident from its beginning up to the time the intruders left.&nbsp; He was kicked, tied and was stabbed three (3) times.&nbsp; It was a violent and traumatic incident in his life.&nbsp; It is not surprising that the image and memory of the faces of appellants cannot be forgotten by Peñon even with the lapse of time.<br><br>Secondly, appellants assail the credibility of Peñon when he stated that after he was assaulted he became unconscious but he recovered in about two minutes.&nbsp; There is nothing improbable in such a testimony of the witness.&nbsp; His unconsciousness must have been momentary and he must have recovered consciousness while the carnage was still going on.&nbsp; It was an honest estimate therefore on his part that his consciousness lapsed only for a couple of minutes.<br><br>Thirdly, appellants then call attention to the fact that when on cross examination Peñon admitted that he was present in Court when the names of the other witnesses were called and when they testified, thus he should not have been allowed to testify.&nbsp; Appellants stress that he gained familiarity with their identities only at the time of the trial and not at the scene of the crime.<br><br>A review of the records of the case show that the testimony of Peñon is predicated on his own personal knowledge.&nbsp; If it is true that he was present and heard the other witnesses testify Peñon, cannot thereby be qualified from testifying.&nbsp; If at all, it may only affect his credibility.<br><br>Fourth, appellants point out the alleged improbability in the testimony of Peñon in the matter of their identification, Peñon said that there was a petromax light and when he turned his face towards the appellants he was kicked on the face but he recognized the appellants as their masks were removed at the time.&nbsp; Appellants assert that the culprits had their faces covered with towels so that it was improbable that they would have removed their masks just to be recognized by Peñon.&nbsp; That is not what Peñon said.&nbsp; He said that the masks of the appellants fell off so he recognized their faces.&nbsp; Appellants argue that Peñon declared four (4) persons took Toñing upstairs for as they were going up he saw four (4) pairs of feet going upstairs and when they came down he saw said four (4) persons.&nbsp; Appellants point out that considering the level of vision of Peñon with his hand tied then and he was lying down with his face towards the ground, he must have seen only up to the feet of the intruders and could not have identified appellants.&nbsp; What Peñon said is that while going up the stairs he saw only the feet of the four (4) persons but when they were going down he saw the faces of the four (4) persons as he turned the ball of his eyes on the side and recognized them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Fifth, appellants invite attention to the general statements and suppositions of Peñon on direct examination stating that he was stabbed three times and he could hear his other companions groaning, so he concluded that they were already dead.&nbsp; At one time, he allegedly said that it was appellant Lito Dava who stabbed his companions Juaning, Odo and Do, and yet on further cross examination, he admitted that he did not see the assailants of his other companions.<br><br>The assertion of Peñon that he was stabbed three (3) times must be of his own knowledge because he was the very victim who suffered the wounds inflicted.&nbsp; His identification of the appellant Dava as the assailant of his co-victims is positive.&nbsp; Although in other parts of his testimony he said he could not identify the assailants of his other companions but only heard their groans and when they became silent he assumed that they were dead, this apparent inconsistency cannot affect his credibility.&nbsp; He was on the witness stand for several days and he was subjected to rigid examination.&nbsp; It is but to be expected that in the tiring process of undergoing such a grilling he could be inconsistent in some portions of his testimony.&nbsp;

They contend she was able to identify said appellant because at the PC investigation she was told that said appellant was one of the suspects.<br><br>Nena Ganaan was at the time a 12-year old girl and a Grade VI student who was among the first ones who saw the three intruders come to the house so she immediately recognized Dava.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> One of the three in­truders shouted at her not to move and aimed a pistol at her but she was able to hide under the bed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> She reorganized Dava after the cover of his face slipped off.&nbsp; She knew Dava before as he and his other companions often came to their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> When the robbers came to their house, Nena was standing by the door leading to the kitchen on the ground floor about three meters away from the door through which the intruders entered the house.&nbsp; A kerosene lamp lighted the place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The claim therefore of the appellants that Nena Ganaan had very limited opportunity to identify any of them is not true.&nbsp; She was sure that one of the assail­ants was appellant Dava.<br><br>Appellants also contend that the testimony of prosecution witness Eutiquio Valledor is not credible as his identification of appellants Wennie Aguhayon, Hermosisimo Galedo, Lito Dava and Nonito Galedo was from a place where he allegedly hid himself behind banana plants about twenty (20) meters distance from the kitchen of Ganaan's house.&nbsp; He testified that the moon was shining but this was contra­dicted by other prosecution witnesses who said that it was raining hard then.&nbsp; Appellants point out that Valledor could not even ascertain what the scabbards of the bolos of the appellants look like.<br><br>On the contrary, the testimony of this witness is credible and this is borne by the evidence.&nbsp; He saw that at 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of October 4, 1968, appel­lant Hermosisimo Galedo purchased four (4) packages of cigarettes and four (4) boxes of matches from the store of the Ganaans.&nbsp; While he was fetching water and resting by the house of the Ganaans, Valledor heard Martina shout from the door of her kitchen "<i>Tonying wala na ang atong Ilyo</i>" (Tonying, our Ilyo is gone) Ilyo was Antonio Ganaan's eldest son.&nbsp; Valledor looked back and saw the appellants as they entered the house of the Ganaans at the kitchen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> After he brought home the water Valledor returned to the place where he stopped for a rest around a banana grove near the Ganaan's kitchen, about twenty (20) meters away.&nbsp; Then he saw several persons come out of the house, namely:&nbsp; Eddie Palmares, Wennie Aguhayon, Nonito Galedo and Lito Dava.&nbsp; On the way he saw Diony Montero and three other persons whom he did not recognize.&nbsp; The surrounding was still a bit bright as there was a moon.&nbsp; Two of the intruders were carrying a gun while the others were carrying bolos and hunting knives.&nbsp; Palmares and Hermosisimo Galedo carried guns.&nbsp; They were eight persons in all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>There is no question that Valledor was able to positively identify the appellants from the place where he was hiding at the banana grove as he was resting.&nbsp; After hearing the shots he concealed himself behind the banana grove.&nbsp; Although it maybe true that it rained then, the rain must have subsided and the moon was up.<br><br>The contention therefore of the appellants that there were no eye-witness to the commission of the crime is without basis.&nbsp; No doubt prosecution witnesses Danilo Peñon, Valledor and Nena Ganaan corroborated each other in positively identifying the appellants as the culprits.<br><br>By and large the assigned errors of the appellants boil down to the matter of credibility of the witnesses and the too-well known rule is that it is the peculiar province of the trial court to determine the credibility of witnesses while testifying because of its superior advantage in observing the conduct and demeanor of witnesses while testifying and its findings shall not be disturbed on appeal unless some facts or circumstances may have been overlooked that may otherwise affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The appellant failed to persuade this Court that it should depart from this rule.<br><br>Under the second assigned error the appellants invoke alibi as a defense.<br><br>Appellant Dava claims that at the time of the incident he was at Barangiran, Kalamada, Cotabato, now North Cotabato with his brother-in-law Gonzalo Cagangoon on the land of Redoro Esteban, vice mayor thereof, as tenants and at 6:00 o'clock in the evening he was at their house.&nbsp; His alibi was not even reiterated in his Brief nor did he assail the admissibility of his extra­judicial confession of November 6, 1968 admitting his complicity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>With respect to appellant Mansueto Casino he asserted that he was with Juanito Epifanio, brother of Mansueto Galedo who went to the scene of the crime after the incident.&nbsp; He allegedly stopped Epifanio from hacking the survivor Danilo Peñon.&nbsp; He claims that on that evening of the incident he was shelling corn at the place of Alfredo Langote when Epifanio arrived informing him the Ganaans have been murdered so he went with them to the place with barrio captain Jose Mandulado.&nbsp; Since admittedly said appellant was shelling corn at a place near the scene of the crime, it was not physically impossible for him to have gone to the scene of the crime, participated in the commission thereof, and returned to the place where he was shelling corn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> If it is true that he was persuaded to come along by Epifanio then it must be because he had no choice otherwise his complicity would have been exposed.&nbsp; Indeed, it was a bold decision that he had to make to portray a picture of innocence.<br><br>As to the appellant Calixto Casino, he stated that if he was liable, he would not have stayed behind in Bo. Bambang and would have fled.&nbsp; Again Calixto must have been that prudent if not smart.&nbsp; He preferred to stay and make it appear that he was innocent.&nbsp; He together with his brother Mansueto even attended the wake of the victims.&nbsp; Such a dramatic performance cannot exculpate them from the heinous crime that they have committed.<br><br>Moreover, the defense of denial and alibi of appellants could not prevail over their positive identification by the prosecution witnesses as authors of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>The Court agrees with the following disquisition of the court <i>a quo</i>:<br><blockquote>"From all the evidence presented by the prosecution, conspiracy has been established beyond reasonable doubt, particularly, by the testimo­nies of victim Danilo Peñon, by Nena Ganaan and Valledor.&nbsp; Peñon, besides declaring that he saw the accused together, tying the victims, stabbing and hacking them, also said that he heard one of them say:&nbsp; '<i>Tana, pauli na ta kay patay naman silang tanan, Wala ng buhi.</i>' which means, 'Come, let us go home, they are all dead.&nbsp; None of them is alive.' We also observed them together getting and carrying the things they've got.<br><br>The prosecution has established beyond reasonable doubt that the seven persons arrived in the place simultaneously together, and they left the premises together, and from the house they followed the same direction.&nbsp; Consequently, the act or acts of one should be considered as the act or acts of each and everyone of them.<br><br>The prosecution has also established beyond reasonable doubt aggravating circumstances:&nbsp; the crime was committed by a band of seven armed persons; the crime was committed in the dwelling of the Ganaans who have not caused any provocation; six victims, namely, Martina Ganaan, Danilo Peñon, Juaning, Do, Odo, and Orbeth Nobleza were made to lie down, face downward and then their hands were tied on their backs before they were hacked and stabbed.&nbsp; The victim Antonio Ganaan was also tied with his hands on the back.<br><br>The acts of making the victims lie down, then tying them, before committing the robbery and stabbing and killing and wounding them, constitute an aggravating circumstance of employing means to weaken the defense of the victims.<br><br>There is still another aggravating circumstance present in this case that is advantage was taken by the accused of their superior strength, and with regard to the victim Martina Ganaan, there was disregard of respect due to her on account of her sex.<br><br>The crime described in the Informations and proved by the prosecution with regard to the seven victims who were killed on the occasion of the robbery, namely, (1) Antonio Ganaan, (2) Martina Ganaan, (3) Rogelio Ganaan, (4) Juanito Afsay, (5) Orbeth Nobliza, (6) Felizardo <i>alias</i> Dado and (7) Dodo <i>alias</i> Daco, is punished under paragraph 1 of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code with the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> to death, because on the occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide was committed; with regard to the victim Danilo Peñon, inasmuch as the law does not provide for a crime of robbery with frustrated homicide, but only for robbery with physical injuries, the penalty provided for under paragraph 4 of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code should be applied considering that Peñon was treated for more than 30 days, and the penalty is <i>prision mayor</i> in its maximum period to <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period or imprisonment of from 10 years and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months, because the robbery was accompanied by physical injuries penalized under subdivision 4 of Article 263 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Considering that there are only aggravating, and no mitigating circumstances, the penalty to be imposed, should be in accordance with paragraphs 3 and 6 of Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code and it should be in its maximum period.<br><br>The Indeterminate Sentence Law is not applicable except in the crime of robbery with physical injuries on Danilo Peñon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></blockquote>As to the penalty imposed of seven (7) death penalties for the seven (7) offenses of robbery and homicide that were committed by the appellants penalized under Article 294, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code in relation with paragraphs 3 &amp; 6 of Art. 64 of the same Code, the same is hereby reduced to seven (7) penalties of <i>reclusion perpetua.</i>&nbsp; The death penalty has already been abolished under the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The indemnity to the heirs of the seven (7) victims to be jointly and severally paid by the appellants should be raised to P30,000.00 for each set of heirs.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> with the above modification as to the penalty and indemnity, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED in all other respects, with costs against the appellants.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Teehankee, C.J., Yap, Fernan, Narvasa, Melencio-Herrera, Gutierrez, Jr., Cruz, Paras, Feliciano, Padilla, Bidin, Sarmiento,</i> and <i>Cortes, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Pp. 48-50, <span style="font-style: italic;">Rollo.</span><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Appellants' brief, p. 171, <i>Rollo.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Pp. 4-14, Appellee's brief, P. 233, <i>Rollo.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> P. 14, Appellants' brief, <i>Supra.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, June 16, 1971, pp. 12, 50, &amp;
