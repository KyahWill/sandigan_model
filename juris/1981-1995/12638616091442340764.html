				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Once again, this Court must determine if the judgment of conviction
rendered by the trial court imposing a sentence of life imprisonment on the
defendant-appellant is proper against the theory of the defense that the
accused was never found in possession of marijuana or caught selling the same
and that the case filed against him was instigated by policemen who were
allegedly extorting money as a consideration for the release of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="GramE">an information</span> that was filed by the
Office of the City Fiscal of Manila with Branch 15 of the Regional Trial Court

Philippines, the said accused, not being authorized by law to distribute any
prohibited drug, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> and
unlawfully deliver, give away, distribute, sell or offer for sale, dried
flowering tops of marijuana, which is prohibited drug.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The findings of fact of the trial court are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Special Operations Unit [or the Narcotics Control and
Investigation Section (NCIS)] received numerous complaints through telephone
calls on the rampant drug-pushing going on at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Barreto</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>, that month of April 1987. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The NCIS operatives looked for an informant to
help them bust such operations until finally, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span>
saw his former informant living within the vicinity of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Barreto</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said informant, upon <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span>
invitation, came to the Special Operations Unit at around 10:00 o'clock that
night of April 14, 1987 and confirmed the rampant activities of drug pushers at
<span class="SpellE">Barreto</span> St., identifying the pushers as 'Jay jay',
‘Pete' and 'Bong'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span> immediately organized a team - he as the team
leader and Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span>, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paltra</span>, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Balatbat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span> Papa as team members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Once organized they proceeded with the informant to </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Barreto</span></span><span class="GramE"> St.</span></st1:address></st1:street><span class="GramE">, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>, to conduct a surveillance to
ascertain/verify whether drug-pushing was really rampant at that area.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They conducted the necessary surveillance by
posting themselves at strategic places and observing what was going on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In due time, they saw the accused, alias
'Bong', talking to teenagers (some riding on bicycles and others walking),
after which he (accused) gave something to the teenagers whom he talked to and
in turn, he received something from the recipients.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Convinced that drug-pushers really
proliferated in that area, the team-members returned to the Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> vehicle which they used and where their team leader,
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span>, was waiting, and reported what they
saw.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then and there, <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span>
briefed them and told them to implement their 'buy-bust' operations with the
informant as the poseur-buyer, using a P10.00 bill marked money (Exhibit 'G')
to buy marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span> was told to stay near the informant <span class="GramE">which</span> he did by staying 5-7 meters from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span>
and Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Balatbat</span> acted as perimeter security
while Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Peltra</span>
and Papa will be the arresting officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The police informant proceeded to where the accused was at that time
which is right in front of their (accused) house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The place was well lighted by <st1:street><st1:address>MERALCO
  street</st1:address></st1:street> lamps.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> was 10 meters from the informant and
the accused while the others stayed at a fair distance so as not to arouse
suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Balatbat</span> stayed in their jeep parked at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Beata</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>, which is some 100
meters from the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was agreed
that the moment their informant, would give the signal (his left hand to
scratch the left side of his head to indicate that the marijuana was already
handed to him and he, in turn, gave the money to the pusher), they will
immediately converge and effect the arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So, when they saw the informant scratching the left side of his head,
the team members converged and closed in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span> identified himself as a policeman to
the accused, after which he, with the assistance of <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span>,
arrested him for selling one tea bag of dried flowering tops of marijuana
(Exhibit F-1').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arrest was <span class="GramE">effected</span> at <st1:time minute="45" hour="12">12:45 o'clock</st1:time>
in the early morning of <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They then brought the accused, together with
the evidence, to the NCIS office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once
they reached their office, <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span> turned over to
the police investigator, Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Eliseo</span></span><span class="GramE"> Zamora, the body of the accused and the subject marijuana (Exhibit
'F-1') and the marked money (Exhibit 'G').</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>
informed <span class="SpellE">Rojo</span> of his constitutional rights to remain
silent, to counsel and the nature of the accusation against him which is drug
pushing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, he prepared a written
request to the NBI for examination of the specimen, which, together with said
specimen, he <span class="SpellE">handcarried</span> to the NBI Forensic
Chemistry Laboratory for the determination of whether the same is positive of
marijuana or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span> and the others executed a joint affidavit of
arrest (Exhibit 'A' and 'A-1’).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused, known as Bong, was not only the pusher in that
place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For he has companions like <span class="SpellE">Jayjay</span> (somewhat fat with a height of 5'5”) and Pete
(medium built and brown complexion).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Actually, the three pushers were their objective that night but it was
only <span class="SpellE">Rojo</span> who appeared.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After <span class="SpellE">Rojo</span> was arrested, he was
asked by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Maniquiz</span></span><span class="GramE"> to empty his pockets.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The marked money (Exhibit 'G') was one of those brought out from the
front right pocket of his (<span class="SpellE">Rojo</span>) pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span> took it
while their informant delivered the marijuana to <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span> Papa
later affixed his initials (Exhibit 'G-1') on the P10.00 bill while Pat. Zamora
placed his initials 'EZ' and date (Exhibit 'F-1-A') on the rolling paper inside
the plastic tea bag containing dried marijuana leaves to insure that they were
the very same articles involved in the 'buy-bust' operations conducted
herein."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The theory of the defense is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Defense evidence tends to show that at around 12:30 o'clock in the
morning of April 15, 1987, appellant was in front of his house conversing with
his relatives relative to the passion-week reading (<span class="SpellE">pabasa</span>)
which he failed to attend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After their
conversation, his relatives left to eat and proceeded to the bakery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon after he was left alone, two men
approached him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asked who they were by
the appellant and what crime did he <span class="GramE">commit,</span> he was
nevertheless frisked and told to stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They collared him and accused him of being a drug pusher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maintaining his innocence, he was brought
their service vehicle parked not far away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because he does not know of any offense which he has committed, appellant
struggled to free himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While he was
frisked by the 2 policemen, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span> placed the
marked money (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"G")
in his pocket.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then again Pat. <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span> showed him a small tea bag of marijuana (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"F-1").</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They then forced him to board their vehicle
and appellant was accompanied by his uncle <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
Gabriel to Precinct 5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The policemen
were asking P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in consideration of the
appellant's release which amount was later on reduced to P3,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant denied selling marijuana.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is - in the
light of the conflicting evidence presented, is there sufficient evidence
beyond reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charge is a grave one that carries with
it a penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the evidence must be evaluated with
extreme care.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fundamental rule that a judgment of conviction must be
predicated on the strength of the evidence for the prosecution and not on the
weakness of the evidence for the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court cannot merely depend upon probabilities and improbabilities
of alleged events.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must determine
whether or not the alleged events actually happened based on the evidence
adduced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the alleged
entrapment must be established by clear and convincing evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of the prosecution is that the informant acted as buyer
in the entrapment proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
the alleged informant was never presented as a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His identity was never revealed because it
was supposed to be confidential information.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution on the matter of the participation
of the informant as alleged buyer in the entrapment proceedings is
contradictory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, according to the
testimony of witness Sgt. Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Carbonel</span>, the <span class="GramE"><u>person</u></span><u> who acted as buyer in the entrapment
proceedings was Patrolman Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span></u>,
with Patrolmen Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alfero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peltra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Papa as
arresting officers, and Patrolman George <span class="SpellE">Balatbat</span> in
charge of perimeter security.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>DIRECT EXAMINATION BY THE

members of your team who participated in this operation and their respective

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, prosecution witness Patrolman Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maniquez</span> testified otherwise in that the informant was the

</span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Alferos</span> was 10 meters away from the
informant and the appellant while Pat. <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span> was
about seven (7) meters away and the others stayed at a far distance so as not
to arouse suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only after
the informant gave the signal by scratching the left side of his head with his
left hand to indicate that the marijuana was already handed to him and that he
in turn gave the money to the appellant that the said police officers converged
and arrested the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are the facts as found by the trial court which show that
none of the prosecution witnesses actually saw the appellant deliver the
alleged bag of flowering tops of marijuana which was allegedly sold to the
informant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also indicates that they
did not see the informant pay the alleged consideration of the sale with a 10-peso
bill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They just assumed that the
transaction was consummated upon a signal from the informant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, therefore, no direct evidence, much
less conclusive proof, to establish the alleged unlawful sale of marijuana
being pinned on the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">If truly there was such an entrapment that was undertaken in this
case, the informant would be the best witness for the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as he was not presented, the case of
the prosecution must fall.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police
officers and the prosecution aver that they did not present the informant as
his identity was a confidential matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the purpose is to conceal the identity of the informant from the
appellant and for the personal security of said informant, the said objective
cannot be attained by withholding the testimony of the informant during the
trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The informant must be well known
if not familiar to the appellant otherwise the latter would not readily sell
the marijuana to the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
identity of the informant was known to the appellant all the time and when
immediately thereafter the appellant was apprehended and arrested by the police
officers and the informant was not similarly taken into custody, the only
logical conclusion is that the appellant right then and there found out that he
was the victim of an entrapment and that the informant was in collusion with
the police authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, no reason why the prosecution could not and
did not present the informant as a prosecution witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is the best witness to establish the
charge against the appellant who denies the charge.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
As the appellant correctly observed, such a failure to present the informant as
a witness gives rise to the presumption that such evidence <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>
suppressed would be adverse if produced.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On the other hand, assuming that the testimony
of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> is correct in that the poseur-buyer
was not the informant but Pat.</span> Francisco <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span>,
then with more reason the theory of entrapment of the prosecution become even
more incredible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not
know Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Maniquiz</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is improbable
that the appellant would risk selling marijuana to a person he met for the
first time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the transaction was allegedly consummated in a public
street within the view of the public including some teenagers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The street light was bright and shining.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the appellant was really a drug pusher, he
would not have so openly sold marijuana in such a public place within the view
of so many people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He would have
attempted to conceal the transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
allegedly transpired in front of his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence appellant could have asked the buyer to go up his house or behind
the house if only to insure its secrecy.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the shaky evidence of the prosecution, the
defense of the appellant consisting not only of a categorical denial of the
imputation against him but an assertion that it was a frame-up and that the
policemen attempted to extort money from him becomes significant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Gabriel, uncle of the
appellant, testified that immediately after the arrest of the appellant by the
policemen, they asked the arresting policemen what crime the appellant
committed and they were told that he was a <span class="SpellE">drugpusher</span>
and that if they wanted his release, they must raise the amount of P5,000.00;
that he went home to raise the amount but was only able to bring P2,000.00;
that the policemen refused to accept the amount and insisted on P3,000.00
instead; and that he did not remember the name of said policemen.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant corroborates the testimony of his uncle in that
when he was locked inside the cell, his uncle talked to the arresting officer
after which he was told by his uncle that they were asking for P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as consideration for his release.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told the policemen that they could not
afford such amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This prompted Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> to lower their demand to P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The haggling took place inside the cell of
Police Precinct No. 5.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> Gabriel, mother of the
appellant, also testified that in the early morning of April 16, 1987, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Gabriel returned and told her that the arresting
policemen were demanding money for her son's release; that she went to the
police headquarters that morning and learned that the arresting policemen were
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>, Patrolmen <span class="SpellE">Balatbat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Maniquiz</span>; that they haggled for a lesser amount
and she was advised to talk to the police investigator, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> Zamora; and that after several days she was able to
talk to <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city> who told her it was
too late because the case against her son was already filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is disturbed by this evidence tending to show that
members of the law enforcement agencies who figured in this case tried to
extort money from the appellant and his family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although it is true as observed by the court <u>a quo</u> that no
complaint was filed against said policemen by the appellant, it should be
understandable not only because the transaction was not consummated but that
appellant and his relatives would certainly think twice before filing such
complaint against the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">This matter should be inquired into.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Three witnesses attest to the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said law enforcement agents should be held
liable if proven to be true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the same
token they should be given a chance to clear their names, if it is without
basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is about time that shady
characters in police uniform should be weeded out.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no dispute that drug pushing is a serious offense
that should be relentlessly ferreted out and the persons responsible
prosecuted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are peddlers of
destruction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be denied that
one of the most effective means of their apprehension is through a
"buy-bust" operation with the assistance of an informant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As above discussed, in such an instance, the
prosecution could easily prove its case with the informant as its witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it is a matter of fact that opium, marijuana
or any other prohibited drug can easily be planted by some corrupt law
enforcement agents on innocent victims as a convenient vehicle of
extortion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And many such persons would
rather buy peace than risk a prosecution however false it maybe.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case the courts must be vigilant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A handy defense in such cases is that it is a
frame-up and that the police attempted to extort from the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Extreme caution must be exercised in
appreciating such defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is just as
easy to concoct as a frame-up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At all
times the police, the prosecution and the courts must be always on guard
against these hazards in the administration of criminal justice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED
and SET ASIDE and another judgment <span class="GramE">is</span> hereby rendered
ACQUITTING appellant <span class="SpellE">Aureo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rojo</span>

deemed proper against the members of the law enforcement agency alluded to in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the acquittal insofar as it is based on the finding
that there is not enough evidence to sustain a conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With regret, however, I am unable to agree
that the presentation of the supposed informer at the trial was indispensable
to the cause of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The decision itself recognizes the
reason for not exposing him but declares just the same that he should have been
called to testify.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It says the sale to
him would have been believable, presuming he was a friend of the accused, but
not to the police officers, who were total strangers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Perhaps so.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But what to me <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was fatal </span>to the People was its own
evidence that the sale took place in a brightly-lit public street in plain view
of some other people and just in front of the defendant's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is what I find implausible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even supposing that the accused was really a
drug pusher, I do not think he would have made the sale in such a place <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>such circumstances, not even if
the informer was a friend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That flaw
rendered more credible the charge of police extortion, which broke the camel's
back.</p>
