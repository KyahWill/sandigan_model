the late Antonio <span class="SpellE">Carniyan</span> subsequent to the issuance
of OCT P-19093 (Exhibit "D", p. 204, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
already states that its northern boundary is <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In effect, he has repudiated any previous
acknowledgment by him, granting that he caused the accomplishment of the tax
declarations in his name before the issuance of OCT No. <span class="GramE">P-19093,
of the existence of Francisco Gerardo's land.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Finally, the trial court
concluded that petitioners have never been in possession of the </span>"subject
land" but the evidence on record proves otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, the trial court on page 11 of its
Decision (p. 121, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>), stated the reason
for denying private respondents' petition for the issuance of a preliminary
injunction, that is, "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
the defendants (petitioners herein) were in actual possession of the land in
litigation prior to September, 1982" (p. 121, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, witness for private respondents,
Esteban <span class="SpellE">Guingab</span>, boundary owner on the east of the
land in question and whose own land is bounded on the north of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> River, on cross-examination, revealed that when his
property was only more than one (1) hectare in 1958, (now more than 4 hectares)
his boundary on the west is the land of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Carniyan</span>
(T.S.N., 5 May 1983, pp. 19-20).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Third,
witness Rogelio C. <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>, a geodetic engineer, on
direct examination stated that in 1974, the late Antonio <span class="SpellE">Carniyan</span>
requested him to survey the land covered by his title and the accretion
attached to it, but he did not pursue the same because he learned from the
Office of the Director of the Bureau of Lands that the same accretion is the
subject of an application for homestead patent of one <span class="SpellE">Democrata</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>, (T.S.N., May 18, 1984, pp. 12-13) contrary to
the statement of the trial court and the appellate court that <span class="SpellE">Albano</span> "made three attempts to survey the land but he
did not continue to survey because persons other than defendants were in
possession of the land," which statement appears only to be a conclusion
(p. 7, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fourth, We note Exhibit “20” (p. 273, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
for petitioners which is an order by the Director of Lands dated August 14,
1980 in connection with the Homestead Application of <span class="SpellE">Democrata</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> of an accretion situated in <span class="SpellE">Catabayungan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aguila's</span> application was disapproved because in an
investigation conducted by the Bureau of Lands of the area applied for which is
an accretion, the same was found to be occupied and cultivated by, among
others, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Carniyan</span>, who claimed it as an
accretion to his land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is worthy to
note that none of the private respondents <span class="GramE">nor</span> their
predecessors-in-interest appeared as one of those found occupying and
cultivating said accretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the allegation of private respondents that
they were in possession of the "motherland" through their
predecessors-in-interest had not been proved by substantial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assailed decision of the respondent
court, which affirmed the decision of the trial court, stated that since the
“motherland” exists, it is also <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">presumed</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>that private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">respondents were in possession of the "subject land" through
their predecessors-in-interest since prior to July 26, 1894.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court relied on the testimony of
Soledad Gerardo, one of the private respondents in this case, an interested and
biased witness, regarding their possession of the "motherland." From </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">her </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">testimony on pedigree, the trial court </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">presumed</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that the source of the
property, the late Francisco Gerardo, was in possession of the same since prior

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The foregoing
considerations indubitably show that the alleged "motherland" claimed
by private respondents is non-existent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The "subject land" is an alluvial deposit left by the
northward movement of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Cagayan</span></span></st1:placename><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and pursuant to Article 457 of the New Civil

gradually receive from the effects of the current of the waters."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, it should be noted that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

hundred eighty four (4,584) square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accretion attached to said land is approximately five and a half <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(5.5) hectares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The increase in the area of petitioners'
