reasons behind this when, upon a claim made by the consignee of a motion
picture film shipped by air that <u>he was never a party to the contract of
transportation and was a complete stranger thereto</u>, it said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"But appellant now contends that he is not suing on a breach
of contract but on a tort as provided for in Art. 1902 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are a little perplexed as to this new
theory of the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, he
insists that the articles of the Code of Commerce should be applied; that he
invokes t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">h</span>e provisions of said
Code governing the obligations of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>common
carrier to make prompt delivery of goods given to it under a contract of
transportation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, as already said,
he says that he was never a party to the contract of transportation and was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>complete stranger to it, and that he
is now suing on a tort or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>violation
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">his </span>rights as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>stranger (culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he does not invoke the contract of carriage
entered into with the defendant company, then he would hardly have any leg to
stand on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His right to prompt delivery
of the can of film at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Phil</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Air</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype></st1:place> stems and is derived from the
contract of carriage under which contract, the PAL undertook to carry the can
of film safely and to deliver it to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">him
</span>promptly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Take away <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">or </span>ignore that contract and the
obligation to carry and to deliver and right to prompt delivery disappear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Common carriers are not obligated by law to
carry and to deliver merchandise, and persons are not vested with the right to
prompt delivery, unless such common carriers previously assume the
obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said rights and obligations
are created by a specific contract entered into by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the findings of the
trial court which as already stated, are accepted by the parties and which we
must accept are to the effect that the LVN Pictures Inc. and Jose Mendoza on
one side, and the defendant company on the other, entered into a contract of
transportation (p.29, Rec. on Appeal).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One interpretation of said finding is that the LVN Pictures Inc. through
previous agreement with <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
acted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>the latter's
agent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he negotiated with the LVN
Pictures Inc. to rent the film ‘<span class="SpellE">Himala</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Birhen</span>’ and show it during the
<span class="SpellE">Naga</span> town fiesta, he most probably authorized and
enjoined the Picture Company to ship the film for him on the PAL on September
17th.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another interpretation is that
even if the LVN Pictures Inc. as consignor of its own initiative, and acting
independently of Mendoza for the time being, made Mendoza as consignee, a
stranger to the contract if that is possible, nevertheless when he, Mendoza
appeared at the Phil Air Port armed with the copy of the Air Way Bill (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) demanding the delivery of the shipment to him, he
thereby made himself a party to the contract of transportation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The very citation made by appellant in his
memorandum supports this view.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Speaking
of the possibility of a conflict between the order of the shipper on the one
hand and the order of the consignee on the other, as when the shipper orders
the shipping company to return or retain the goods shipped while the consignee
demands their delivery, <span class="SpellE">Malagarriga</span> in his book <span class="SpellE">Codigo</span> de <span class="SpellE">Comercio</span> <span class="SpellE">Comentado</span>, Vol. 1, p. 400, citing a decision of the
Argentina Court of Appeals on commercial matters, cited by <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
in Vol. II of his book entitled 'Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the
Commercial Laws of the Philippines' p. 209, says that the right of the shipper
to countermand the shipment terminates when the consignee or legitimate holder
of the bill of lading appears with such bill of lading before the carrier and
makes himself a party to the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Prior to that time he is a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">stranger
to the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Still another view of this phase of the case is that contemplated
in Art. 1257, paragraph 2, of the old Civil Code (now Art. 1311, second
paragraph) which reads thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Should the contract contain any stipulation in favor of a third
person, he may demand its fulfill­ment provided he has given notice of his
acceptance to the person bound before the stipulation has been revoked.'</p>

<blockquote>Here, the contract of carriage between the LVN Pictures Inc. and
the defendant carrier contains the stipulations of delivery to <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>
as consignee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His demand for the
delivery of the can of film to him at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Phil</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Air</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype></st1:place>
may be regarded as a notice of his acceptance of the stipulation of the
delivery in his favor contained in the contract of carriage and delivery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case he also made himself a party to
the contract, or at least has come to court to enforce it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His cause of action must necessarily be
founded on its breach."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It seems clear that even
if said section 4(5) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act did not exist, the
validity and binding effect of the liability limitation clause in the bill of
lading here are nevertheless fully sustainable on the basis alone of </span>the
cited Civil Code provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That said
stipulation is just and reasonable is arguable from the fact that it echoes
Art. 1750 itself in providing a limit to liability only if a greater value is
not declared for the shipment in the bill of lading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To hold otherwise would amount to questioning
the justice and fairness of that law itself, and this the private respondent
does not pretend to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But over and
above that consideration, the just and reasonable character of such stipulation
is implicit in its giving the shipper or owner the option of avoiding accrual
of liability limitation by the simple and surely far from onerous expedient of
declaring the nature and value of the shipment in the bill of lading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since the shipper here has not been heard
to complain of having <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">been
