<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, both accused <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Favie</span> contend that it was Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Calpo</span> and no other, who fired the fatal shots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said contention was given credence by the
trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Calpo</span> did not appeal while <span class="SpellE">Favie</span>
withdrew his appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
issue narrows down to the participation of accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> in the commission of the crimes charged. He insists
that his extrajudicial statement <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">well as </span>those of his co-accused were

was conspiracy among them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
his counsel argued that said statements cannot be used to implicate <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for appellant <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> and accused <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Favie</span>, Jr., who (<span class="SpellE">Favie</span>, Jr.)
later withdrew his appeal, contends that bereft of the extrajudicial
confessions of the appellants, there is nothing left to prop up the judgment of
conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among the matters specified
and pointed out <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>proofs of
involuntariness of appellant's extrajudicial statements, are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the remonstrance of <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>
over the inaccuracy and even the incompleteness of the statement (Exhibit M)
taken from him and prepared by the investigator Sgt. Ricardo; (2) the
implication of the need to mention the name "Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Rana</span>"
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the
person who loaned his automatic carbine to accused Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Calpo</span>
despite knowledge that said Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Rana</span> was already
dead; and (3) the fact that he failed to file charges against his tormentors
because Martial Law had just been proclaimed and it was highly improbable for
such action to prosper, or to secure a medical certificate to show the physical
harm inflicted upon him by the investigators because his sister, who could have
been his medium for ventilating his grievances, was denied the privilege of
visiting him at the Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span> Stockade (Brief for
the Accused-Appellants, pp. 4-10).</p>

<p class="BODY">A close scrutiny of <span class="SpellE">Damaso’s</span> statement
(Exhibit M) and the findings of the trial court would inevitably show that he
had narrated certain details that only he could have supplied without force and
coercion. Against the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses pointing to him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the
triggerman during the shooting incident, <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> told
his interrogators that it was Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Calpo</span> who shot
the victims, then narrated in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">rich </span>detail
his own version of the fleeting events before and after the shooting aside from
other facts which his investigators could not have been interested to know and
which could have been known only to him, thereby lending credence and
reliability thereon (People v. <span class="SpellE">Torrefranca</span>, 151 SCRA
143 [1987]; People v. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos, 150 SCRA 311
[1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Nillos</span>, 127 SCRA 207 [1984]; People
v. Jimenez, 105 SCRA 721 [1981]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Felicito</span> Ricardo, the PC
investigator of <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>, testified that <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> gave his extrajudicial confession (Exhibit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">M) </span>freely
and voluntarily, the truth of the matter being that after he had signed Exhibit
M, he subscribed and swore to the said statement before Lt. <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Penilla</span> in the absence of Sgt. Ricardo, who left <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> alone with Lt. <span class="SpellE">Penilla</span>
during the ratification of said document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Hearing of March 6, 1974, TSN, p. 315).</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, in the absence of proof that Sgt. Ricardo extracted
<span class="SpellE">Damaso’s</span> extrajudicial statement by force and
intimidation, the same should be considered to have been freely and voluntarily
given, as Sgt. Ricardo has in his favor the presumption of regularity in the
performance of his duty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, said
investigator did not know the accused before the investigation and there is no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cogent reason </span>shown that Sgt. Ricardo
had any motive to incriminate <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> to a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">serious crime. </span>(Decision, Criminal
Cases Nos. 6934-36; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30).</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of appellant <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> that he
was constrained to use the name of "Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Rana</span>"
as the source of the fatal weapon because of force and duress, is
untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such fact alone is irrelevant
and cannot support his claim of force and intimidation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is more reasonable to believe the findings
of the trial court that at the time that <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Damaso</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> was </span>being investigated, he did not know the name of security
guard Charles <span class="SpellE">Miane</span>, from whom the carbine was
borrowed because <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> met the latter for the first
time only when that fatal gun was borrowed from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>
was the first to be apprehended and investigated, so much so, that during his
investigation he could not have yet learned from his co-accused who were then
still at large that the name of the security guard from whom they borrowed the
gun is Charles <span class="SpellE">Miane</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally incredible is appellant <span class="SpellE">Damaso's</span>
claim that he could not have filed charges against his alleged tormentors as
Martial Law was then newly imposed throughout the country, and that his unnamed
sister was denied the privilege of visiting him at the stockade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The former argument is a legal <u>non</u> <u>sequitur</u>
and at most, based on surmise or conjecture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The latter argument could have been better off with the presentation of
his supposed sister as his witness to corroborate his claim, but for reason
only known to him, he chose to suppress such testimony as evidence and instead
risked the adverse inference and legal presumption, "that evidence
willfully suppressed would be adverse if produced" (Section 5[e], Rule 131,
Rules of Court; Enriquez, et al. v. Manuel, et al., 76 Phil. 558; Worcester v. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, 22 Phil. 42).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And even his claim, that had his sister visited him in his confinement, <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> could have aired his grievances to her, is at most
far-fetched, and an afterthought as a last ditch effort to buttress his
allegations of force and intimidation in executing his extrajudicial statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be that <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>it
may, <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Favie</span>
admitted in their separate extrajudicial confessions (Exhibits M and O) that
with Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Calpo</span>, they plotted the killing of the
persons they <span class="SpellE">quarrelled</span> with; but nowhere in the
records did <span class="SpellE">Favie</span> state that his extrajudicial
confession was tainted with force and/or coercion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even on the witness <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">stand, </span>he did not insinuate that he was ever subjected to
violence or intimidation before he gave his statement to Sgt. Ricardo, although
he claims that some of the answers given to the questions propounded were not
his.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, like <span class="SpellE">Damaso's</span> confession, <span class="SpellE">Favie's</span> confession is likewise replete with details he
alone could supply and therefore, deserving of credence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pingol</span>, 33 SCRA 73 [1976]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is no less important that he withdrew his appeal, thereby giving rise
to the implication <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>he could
not support his allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, bare assertions of maltreatment by the police
authorities in extracting confessions from the accused are not sufficient in
view of the standing rule enunciated in the cases of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing considerations, it is evident that the
extrajudicial confessions of the accused, more particularly of appellant <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> herein, have been freely and voluntarily given,
despite protestations to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, appellant finds fault with the trial court's
conclusion that conspiracy does in fact exists which implicates all the accused
as principals by common design.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that conspiracy exists when two or more
persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide
to commit it, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">whether </span>they act
through the physical volition of one or all, proceeding severally or collectively
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Laguardia</span>, 148 SCRA 133 [1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Petenia</span>, 143 SCRA 36<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1

466 [1982]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span>, 98 SCRA 235 [1980]).
While it is desirable that the conspiracy be proved by direct evidence, like an
express understanding among the plotters affirming their commitment and
defining their respective roles, it may nevertheless be established at times by
circumstantial evidence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Petil</span>, 149 SCRA 92
[1987]; Castillo v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 151 SCRA 425

People v. <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, 147 SCRA 146 [1987]). Conspiracy is
established by evidence of unity of purpose at the time of the commission of
the offense and unity in its execution (People v. <span class="SpellE">Bravante</span>,
150 SCRA 569 [1987]; People v. Rosas, 149 SCRA 464 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And as conspirators, the accused is equally
responsible for the acts of the co-conspirators (People v. <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>,
151 SCRA 248 [1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span>, 147 SCRA 427
[1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, will be noted that aside from the
extrajudicial confessions of the accused, the following attendant circumstances
and/or contemporaneous acts which occurred in uninterrupted sequence, were
undisputedly established by the trial court from the mass of evidence, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) A slapping incident preceded the shooting, wherein the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Gilber</span> slapped the face of appellant <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>; (2) Before the two groups could engage in a
physical clash, they were pacified by the <span class="SpellE">carinderia</span>
owner who later flagged a taxicab for the three accused; (3) The three boarded
the taxicab leaving with <span class="SpellE">Damaso's</span> parting words,
"Pare <span class="SpellE">hintay</span> kayo, <span class="SpellE">babalik</span>
<span class="SpellE">kami</span>"; (4) They then proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Unimart</span> <span class="SpellE">Greenhills</span>, arriving at
the post of Charles <span class="SpellE">Miane</span> where all of them
disembarked and persuaded <span class="SpellE">Miane</span> to lend them his
carbine; (5) <span class="SpellE">Miane</span> testified that in borrowing the
gun, all of them (accused) signed the logbook and when <span class="SpellE">Miane</span>
was in the act of handing the carbine, the three accused were grabbing it from
him; (6) After having received the gun, they again boarded the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">same taxicab </span>and returned to the <span class="SpellE">carinderia</span>; (7) Upon arrival, gunshots were fired from the
taxicab with the three accused on board, hitting the victims as earlier
narrated; (8) After having fired at the victims, the three went back <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>Charles <span class="SpellE">Miane</span>,
returned the weapon and then proceeded to the headquarters of the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Security and Protective Agency where they narrated
the incident (Decision; Criminal Cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Nos.
</span>6934-36; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 27).</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly observed by the trial court, the foregoing
"attendant circumstances" occurring in uninterrupted sequence attest
to the concurrence of wills of the three accused and the unity of their purpose
and action (<u>Ibid</u>.; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 28).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court was convinced that the flight of the three
accused was unquestionably indicative of their guilty conscience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among others, accused <span class="SpellE">Damaso's</span>
claim that he went into hiding as he was informed by <span class="SpellE">Zeny</span>
<span class="SpellE">Navela</span> that there was a shoot-to-kill order issued
against him by the authorities, was not established by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Zeny</span> <span class="SpellE">Navela</span> herself despite
grilling cross-examination (Hearing of November 14, 1973; TSN, pp. 192-214).</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite appellant's counsel's protestations that <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> cannot be expected to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">expose </span>himself to an invitation of the military authorities during
those first few days of Martial Law (Appellants' Brief, p. 19), the trial court
did not fail to notice that there was no immediate necessity for <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> to flee to the province upon learning that <span class="SpellE">Calpo's</span> gunshots had killed the victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he should have stayed and cooperated
with the authorities in apprehending the culprits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly held by the trial court, appellant’s
flight <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">only </span>underscored his role
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>the criminal act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still further, the actuations of appellant
are not consistent with the actuations of a person afraid of Martial Law but of
one with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>guilty conscience.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as consistently held by this Court, flight is an indication
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>guilty
mind (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ornozo</span>, 151 SCRA 495 [1987]; People

SCRA 99 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, not even the
readily contrived reason of fear of Martial Law averred by counsel for the
appellant can overturn such<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>a
widely-accepted aphorism.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been established beyond dispute that conspiracy exists
among the three accused, both by circumstantial and direct evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, the guilt of appellants’
co-accused has been established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span>

which is positive in nature than the negative evidence of the defendant and his
witnesses (People v. <span class="SpellE">Labis</span>, G.R. No. L-33087, <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1987</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for the defense capitalizes on the fact that the

<p class="BODY">While counsel for appellant admits hypothetically that appellants
agreed to go back to the <span class="SpellE">carinderia</span> only to scare the
victims with the use of firearm, but not to kill them, he insists that
conspiracy and proposal to commit a felony are not punishable except only in
cases where the law specifically provides a penalty <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
(Citing Article 8, Revised Penal Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">This defense does not deserve consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention that there was no plan to kill the
victims, but only to scare them, is belied by the kind of weapon used; the
accuracy of the shots directed against the victims; and the gravity of their
wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even granting that such
claim was true, it will not relieve appellant of criminal responsibility as
co-conspirator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the intention was

natural and logical consequences resulting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>

Navarro, 7 Phil. 715 [1907]; U.S. v. Zamora, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">32 </span>Phil. 218 [1915]; People v. Cardenas, 56 SCRA 631 [1974]).</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, the oft-repeated aphorism that the appellate
courts will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court especially as
to credibility of witnesses (People v. Martinez, 144 SCRA 303 [1986]; People v.
<span class="SpellE">Royeras</span>, 130 SCRA 265 [1984]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Adones</span>, 144 SCRA 364 [1986]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Patag</span>,
144 SCRA 429 9[1986]), deserves reiteration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>More specifically, findings of the lower court on the existence of a
conspiracy should not be disturbed, not only because they are logical, but also
because they are based on evidence appearing in the record (People v. <span class="SpellE">Arhis</span>, 144 SCRA 687 [1986]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even defense counsel's assertion
that justice in this case was inconsistent when the trial court credited appellant's
testimony that it was <span class="SpellE">Calpo</span> who fired the fatal shots
but discredited his testimony as regards other facts (Appellants’ Brief, p.
12), cannot overturn this legal truism, because it is equally well established
that a testimony of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>witness
can be believed as to some facts and disbelieved <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>to other facts (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>,
Jr., 142 SCRA 427 [1986]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacabes</span>, 137 SCRA
158 [1985]), depending upon the corroborative evidence and the probabilities
and improbabilities of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, where appellants’ extrajudicial confessions and testimonies
categorically point to each other's actual participation in the conspiracy and
in the execution of the crime, they are admissible in evidence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Petenia</span>, 143 SCRA 362 [1986]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, independent of the
extrajudicial confessions of the accused, their guilt has been proven beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resume there appears to be no reason to disturb the finding of
conviction by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court appealed from
