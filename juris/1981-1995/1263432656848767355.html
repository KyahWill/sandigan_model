				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners are seamen who are seeking the reinstatement of the
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration decision dated April 4, 1988,
which was reversed by the National Labor Relations Commission's split
resolution<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a> dated September 29, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in June of 1983, a giant corporation - Modern Asia
Corporation, hired some thirteen (13) Filipino seamen (among them, herein
petitioners), who boarded the vessel named M/V Mighty Sea which is of
Panamanian registry.  However, on March
15, 1984, in an emergency letter they wrote the Minister of National Defense,
Philippines, for help as they were stranded for months without food and light
despite filing of a case in Greece courts, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"That, we arrived here in the port of Thessaloniki, Greece
last October 12, 1983 loading for flour (sic).  Our contract was (sic) expired last November 6, 1983 and we want to be
repatriated at the most convenient port upon the completion of our contract.  That our salaries for six months since June
1983 up to November 1983 was (sic) not given to us, so we are claiming for it
(sic).  Until the loading of cargo was
finished, still the company did not give our salaries (sic).  So we filed a complaint to a seaman's lawyer
so that he can help us to solve our problems (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That, we already appeal in the court for two times, but still
no action was granted to help us (sic).  Now, we are already stranded herein the said port for almost six months,
without foods and lights (sic).  Up to
the present, we are claiming our ten months salaries (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"So in this siituation, we are begging for your help, just to
solve our problems (sic)." (p. 42, Records) (p. 39, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A second letter to the Philippines, addressed to the Foreign
Exchange Department of the National Seamen Board on May 2, 1984 from, now, only
eleven (11) seamen, came desperately seeking assistance in their continuing
problems with their work like non-payment of salaries with request after
mentioning possible deductions from their salaries, that they will then be
unable to remit the full amount of foreign currency required of overseas worker
in their situation because of the dilemma they were presently in, thus: -</p>

<blockquote>"We the undersigned 11 (eleven) Filipino crew, on board the
vessel, M/V MIGHTY SEA Panamanian registry, under the management of M.A.
Hambury Company Limited, with the office address in 41 Akti Miaouli Street,
Piracus, Greece (sic).  Our local agency
is Modern Asia Shipping Corporation, with the address in Suite 32, Ground Floor
Midland Plaza-Arcade, M. Adriatico Street, Ermita, Metro Manila,
Philippines.  (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We were stranded here in the Port of Thessaloniki, Greece,
claiming our salary 10 (ten) months (sic).  We get our lawyer to depend us, get our salary (sic).  We have an agreement to our lawyer and also
to the charterers, to give 15% each of them from our salary (sic).  So, the total deduction from our salary is
30%.  In this connection we are unable
to remit the full amount of foreign currency.  Please consider our case and give at least 30% concession regarding to
our situation (sic)." (pp. 39-40, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Due to the cases filed against the foreign owner of the vessel as
aforementioned in the seamen's first letter dated March 15, 1984, said owner
was imprisoned for 3 years and 8 months (comment of Solicitor General on the
petition, p. 50, Rollo and memorandum for the petitioners, p. 109, Rollo).  Hence, upon repatriation on July 19, 1984
the eleven seamen executed a joint affidavit complaint against the corporation
which hired them, herein private respondent (Modern Asia Shipping Corporation)
for breach of contract, to quote: -</p>

<blockquote>"1.  That we are
formally charging with breach of contract our employer the MODERN ASIA SHIPPING
CORPORATION, with offices at 2nd Floor, 491 Dona Tesoras Building, corner A.
Mabini and Pedro Gil Sts., Ermita, Manila, upon the following recital of facts
as hereunder set forth:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.  <u>That</u> <u>we</u>
<u>left</u> <u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u> <u>under</u> <u>this</u> <u>contract</u>
<u>of</u> <u>one-year</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>respondent</u> <u>sometime</u>
<u>June,</u> <u>1983</u> <u>and</u> <u>arrived</u> <u>at</u> <u>Greece</u> <u>on</u>
<u>October,</u> <u>1983;</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.  <u>That,</u> <u>since</u>
<u>the</u> <u>period</u> <u>of</u> <u>our</u> <u>departure</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
<u>time</u> <u>of</u> <u>our</u> <u>being</u> <u>repatriated</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Philippines</u> <u>sometime</u> <u>May,</u> <u>1984,</u> <u>we</u> <u>never</u>
<u>received</u> <u>any</u> <u>amount</u> <u>under</u> <u>our</u> <u>contract</u>
<u>of</u> <u>engagement</u> <u>or</u> <u>employment</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>said</u>
<u>respondent;</u> </blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.  <u>That</u> <u>we</u>
<u>never</u> <u>received</u> <u>any</u> <u>tangible</u> <u>amount</u> <u>as</u>
<u>would</u> <u>amount</u> <u>to</u> <u>our</u> <u>entitlements</u> <u>by</u> <u>way</u>
<u>of</u> <u>allowances,</u> <u>food</u> <u>and</u> <u>other</u> <u>provisions</u>
<u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>company;</u> <u>and,</u> <u>that</u> <u>we</u> <u>survived</u>
<u>our</u> <u>being</u> <u>stranded</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>port</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Thessaloniki,</u> <u>Greece</u> <u>as</u> <u>objects</u> <u>of</u> <u>charity,</u>
<u>until</u> <u>our</u> <u>charterer,</u> <u>through</u> <u>our</u> <u>pleadings,</u>
<u>decided</u> <u>to</u> <u>send</u> <u>us</u> <u>home</u> <u>at</u> <u>their</u>
<u>expense;</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.  <u>That,</u> <u>we</u>
<u>have</u> <u>claim</u> <u>for</u> <u>11</u> <u>months</u> <u>of</u> <u>pay</u>
<u>against</u> <u>the</u> <u>respondent,</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>respective</u>
<u>rates</u> <u>that</u> <u>is</u> <u>provided</u> <u>under</u> <u>the</u> <u>terms</u>
<u>and</u> <u>conditions</u> <u>of</u> <u>our</u> <u>contract</u> <u>of</u> <u>employment;</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>That</u> <u>we</u>
<u>voluntarily</u> <u>and</u> <u>freely</u> <u>execute</u> <u>this</u> <u>document</u>
<u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>basis</u> <u>for</u> <u>our</u> <u>legal</u> <u>action</u>
<u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>premises,</u> <u>without</u> <u>malice,</u> <u>but</u> <u>only</u>
<u>as</u> <u>due</u> <u>and</u> <u>entitled</u> <u>us</u> <u>under</u> <u>existing</u>
<u>and</u> <u>applicable</u> <u>law</u> <u>as</u> <u>meriting</u> <u>our</u> <u>cause</u>
<u>of</u> <u>action</u>." (Underscoring supplied) (pp. 40-41, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent tried to pacify the eleven (11) seamen
(including the 3 petitioners) but after a little over two (2) years, the
seamen's salaries, still unpaid, and their grievances still unacted upon, they
(only 9 seamen this time) finally filed a formal complaint against private
respondent, the local manning agency of N.A. Hambury Company Ltd.  Citing as reason why the formal complaint
was filed with the POEA only after 2 years, petitioners stated in their position
paper/affidavit dated March 18, 1987:</p>

<blockquote>"Complainants were not able to file this case immediately
because the shipping agency promised us that we would be re­hired, but it did
not comply with its promise.  On the
contrary it was the herein respondent who acted in bad faith by giving us false
promises and false hopes.  Nevertheless
as early as July 19, 1984, we have already executed the Affidavit of Complaint,
<u>Annex</u> <u>A</u>, hereof, for we were decided to file the case." (p.
108, Rollo).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This complaint sought to recover unpaid
wages, unpaid 11 months' salaries of petitioners Nelson Gestopa -
US$450.00/month; Diony Rapiz - US$160.00/month; and Anatalio Ona,
US$160.00/month, plus payment of food supplies and other expenses for daily
living like soaps, etc., for payment of a Greece lawyer and also for moral and
exemplary damages.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">On October 20, 1986, summons was issued
to the private respondent and pre-trial conference as well as many hearings
were cancelled and postponed to give all available opportunities for the
private respondent to prepare its defense:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x for the reason that the necessary documents and/or
papers needed in support of its defenses will come from abroad." (p. 9-10,
Records of POEA Case No. (M) 86-10-933)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Complainants-petitioners, in their sincere quest for justice and knowing
all the while that they were defenseless against a giant corporation as their
opponent, never objected to the aforestated cancellations and postponements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on April 4, 1988, the Philippines Overseas
Administration, handed its decision, disallowing payments of withheld food
supplies, daily crew maintenance expenses, ruling that the complainants -
petitioners should not also be given expenses for the Greek lawyer and
Philippines lawyers, and likewise no award for moral and exemplary damages.  However, the salaries of the
complainants-petitioners for eleven (11) months were awarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this POEA's niggardly decision, private respondent
corporation still appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission, Second
Division, on April 20, 1988, questioning the seamen's payment of their salaries
citing the letter dated May 2, 1984, as its alleged proof that the seamen were
already paid their 11-month-salaries.  Private respondent was not able to secure any evidence or receipt of
alleged payment of salaries involved, and no proof whatsoever from the lawyer
allegedly hired by the seamen.  The
seamen on their part contended that since the truth was that they were not yet
really paid their 11-month-salaries aboard the foreign vessel, no receipt or
proof to this effect can be produced by private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC, Second Division, reversed the POEA decision in its
resolution dated September 29, 1989 thus -</p>

<blockquote>"We find the appeal impressed with merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the consideration of the merits of this case the Administrator
failed to consider the letter written by herein complainants to the Foreign
Exchange Department of the National Seaman Board asking for 30% percent
concession in the remittance of their salary.  Pertinent portion of the letter is quoted hereunder:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'We are stranded in the Port of Thessaloniki, Greece, claiming our
salary for ten (10) months, we got our lawyer to depend us (sic), got our
salary, we have agreement to our lawyer and also to the charterer, give 15%
each of them from our salary (sic).   So,
the total deduction from our salary is 30%.  In this connection we are unable to remit the full amount of foreign
currency.  Please consider our case and
give at least 30% concession regarding to our situation (sic).</p>

<blockquote>"Said letter is a clear indication that herein complainants
were able to get payment of their salaries after hiring the services of a
lawyer.  The said letter was attested to
by the Master of the Vessel, the Greek lawyer and the charterer of the Vessel."
(p. 17, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There was a dissenting statement of its
Presiding Commissioner Daniel M. Lucas, Jr.:</p>

<blockquote>"I am for the affirmance of the POEA Decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by the petitioners which
motion was denied on November 10, 1989, again with the divided voting:</p>

<blockquote>"I reiterate my dissenting opinion."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(Sgd) DANIEL
M. LUCAS, JR.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Presiding Commissioner"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this NLRC divided denial of the motion for reconsideration,
the petitioners came to Us <u>via</u> a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
charging the NLRC commissioners with grave abuse of discretion in ignoring the
rest of the evidence used by the POEA in weighing the case and coming up with
the conclusion that the petitioners had already been paid their salaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is obviously meritorious.  The real issue raised is whether or not
petitioners have already received their salaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are tasked to scrutinize the whole record of the case
including the evidence presented since the findings of the POEA and the NLRC
are contrary to each other (Quality Tobacco Corporation v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 187 SCRA 210).</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful study of this case reveals that the POEA exerted much
diligence and came out with an impartial analysis in investigating, hearing and
deciding POEA Case No. (M) 86-10-933 (Diony Rapiz, et al., complainants, versus
Modern Asia Shipping Corporation, Respondent) resulting in the award of the
eleven (11) months' salaries of petitioners Diony Rapiz, Nelson Gestopa and
Anatalio Ona, ordered to be paid by private respondent Modern Asia Shipping
Corporation within ten (10) calendar days at the exchange rate prevailing at
the time of actual payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Presiding Commissioner of the NLRC, Second Division Daniel M.
Lucas, Jr. even voted in favor of this POEA decision, siding with the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, the Solicitor General's Office, after a long and
objective scrutiny of the case, could not in its conscience, defend public
respondent NLRC, which reversed the POEA decisison.  Thus, in the Solicitor General's conclusion and recommendation,
it is stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Private respondent corporation failed to substantiate clear
and convincing evidence its affirmative defense of payment.  Hence, the NLRC erred and gravely abused its
discretion in reversing and setting aside the POEA Decision dated April 4,
1988.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, it is
respectfully recommended that the Resolution of the NLRC dated September 29,
1989 be set aside and the POEA Decision dated April 4, 1988 be reinstated and
affirmed <u>en</u> <u>toto</u>, with costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This being an adverse Comment, it is respectfully prayed that
public respondent NLRC be directed to file its own Comment to the instant
Petition, granting it a period of thirty (30) days from notice." (pp.
67-68 Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent NLRC however, replied only after almost ten
(10) months and after a resolution had been sent by this Court requiring it to
show cause why it should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt
for failure to comment on the petition for <i>certiorari</i> as required in its
resolution of April 2, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its comment, public respondent insists that the petitioners
have already received their salaries citing their letter dated May 2, 1984 when
they wrote the Foreign Exchange Department of the National Seamen Board.  It relies mainly on some past tenses like
"got" instead of "will get" used in said letter when the
same contains mixed tenses.  It is
noteworthy that this was written when the seamen were <u>without</u> food and
supplies, <u>stranded</u> in the vessel for almost one year, not paid their
salaries for ten (10) months (at the time of writing), subjected to all kinds
of tensions, hungry, desperate, abandoned in a foreign land, away from their
loved ones, and merely barely living.  In this miserable condition, what kind of letter can be expected of
them?  Furthermore, using this May 2,
1984 letter as a defense was not initially resorted to by the private
respondent, as it knew that it had to really substantiate its alleged
payment.  Said substantiation never came
- no receipts, no documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent nagged and cajoled the POEA and petitioners no
end in requesting for extensions of time to look for proofs that the
petitioners had already been paid.  From
the records we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"On December 29, 1986, respondent filed another urgent motion
requesting that ?</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x x an extension of thirty (30) days to file its answer position
