This is a petition for review of the orders of the Ministry of Labor 
dated July 14, 1981 and January 11, 1983 sustaining the complaint of 
Cecilio Apolinario for illegal dismissal against petitioner A. Marquez, 
Inc. filed before the Office of the Regional Director, Ministry of 
Labor, Region IX, City of Zamboanga.
<p>
Cecilio Apolinario had been employed as driver of a cargo truck of 
petitioner A. Marquez, Inc. working almost daily for more than three 
years with a daily wage of P12.00 when on April 25, 1978, he was 
allegedly illegally dismissed by his employer.  In his complaint, Mr. 
Apolinario alleged the following circumstances which led to his illegal 
dismissal:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span>                xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span>                   xxx
  </p>
  <p> "3. That on April 25, 1978 without sufficient cause, respondent 
did not allow complainant to drive the cargo truck he used to drive, 
instead gave to another driver, despite plea from complainant to drive; </p>
  <p> "4. That on the following day, complainant came to see the manager
 but the latter refused, alleging that he could not drive owing to his 
denial before the police of the alleged theft of 3 empty shells for 
Coke."
  </p>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span> xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span> xxx </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On October 3, 1978, the complaint was dismissed because of the failure 
of Mr. Apolinario to appear at the hearing scheduled on August 1, 1978. 
 Upon Apolinario's motion for reconsideration, the dismissal order was 
set aside and the complaint reinstated.  The complaint was then referred
 to a hearing officer for investigation.
</p><p>
At the hearing on the merits of the complaint, Apolinario presented the 
following arguments to subs­tantiate his stand that he was illegally 
dismissed by the petitioner:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x first, respondent had not filed any application for 
clearance to ter­minate his services; second, no invest­igation was ever
 conducted by respondent; and third, the alleged theft of empty coke 
shells cannot be a ground for dismis­sal.  He argued that the letter of 
the accountant of the Zamboanga Coca-Cola plant used as basis for his 
dismissal, should not have been given weight by respondent, especially 
in view of his three years of services.  He maintained that anybody 
could have placed the coke shells under the chassis of the truck he was 
driving, either jokingly or intentionally.  He contended further that 
the absence of any intent on his part to steal is evident from the 
circumstances of the case.  He explained that the Coca-Cola plant is 
several kilometers away from the wharf, his destin­ation point at the 
time he was driving, and that if he really had the intention to steal 
the empty shells, he could have hidden them along the way.  Moreover, he
 pointed out that the place where the empty shells were unloaded was 
full of workers at the time."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the other hand, the petitioner whose main business was the hauling of
 empty Coca-Cola bottles from the Zamboanga City wharf to the Coca-Cola 
Plant at Tetuan, Zamboanga City denied the illegal dismis­sal charge.  
The petitioner maintained that its refusal to let Apolinario drive its 
cargo truck was due to the ban imposed against him by the San Miguel 
Corporation to enter the Coca-Cola Plant premises.  According to the 
petitioner, Apolinario was found to have been guilty by the Coca-Cola 
management of theft consisting of one loose PS shells and two loose RS 
shells or cases of empty coke bottles as a result of which the 
accountant of the Zamboanga Coca-Cola Plant wrote a letter to the 
petitioner informing it that Mr. Apolinario was banned from entering the
 Coca-Cola Plant premises because of the misdemeanor.
</p><p>
On the basis of the "Report and Recommendation" submitted by the hearing
 officer, the Regional Director in an Order dated January 26, 1978 
dismissed the complaint based on the following grounds: "(1) that 
complainant after he was not allowed to drive, voluntarily left his 
employment, and seek (sic) employment with the Zamboanga Stevedores and 
Dockhandlers Corporation." The said order was appealed by Mr. Apolinario
 to the Minister of Labor.  In an Order dated July 14, 1981, Deputy 
Minister Vicente Leogardo, Jr. acting in behalf of the Minister of Labor
 set aside the questioned order and declared that the petitioner was 
guilty of illegal dismissal vis-a-vis Apolinario.  Hence, Armando 
Marquez, the manager of the petitioner company was directed "to 
immediately reinstate Apolinario x x x in his former position with full 
backwages, without loss of seniority rights and with payment to him of 
all other applicable benefits."
</p><p>
On a motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioner and in view of 
the certification by the assistant city treasurer of Zamboanga City that
 petitioner A. Marquez, Inc. managed by Armando Marquez had "retired" 
its business license since January 3, 1980, the Deputy Minister issued 
an Order dated January 11, 1983 modifying the July 14, 1981 Order as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x xThat respondent grant separation pay to complainant 
equivalent to one-half month pay for every year of service; and (2) that
 respondent pay the backwages of the complainant from the time he was 
dismissed on April 25, 1978 as found in the Order of this Office dated 
July 14, 1981 until January 3, 1980 when respondent's business license 
was retired."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Deputy Minister of Labor's ruling was due to the petitioner's 
failure to file the required clearance requirement from the Ministry of 
Labor compounded by the petitioner's failure to personally investigate 
the theft charge against Mr. Apolinario by the San Miguel Corporation.  
Hence, the Deputy Minister stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We rule for complainant.  It is clear that he was dismissed 
without the requisite clearance.  This is impliedly admitted by 
respondent when it simply did not allow complainant to drive anymore on 
the basis merely of the letter of Coca-Cola plant's accountant.  But 
prescinding from the procedural aspect of the case, we do not see any 
justification for complainant's dismissal.  While it is true that there 
was a report on complainant's admission of guilt in an attempted theft 
of Coca-Cola shells and his subsequent banning from the premises of the 
bottling company, that report alone is not a sufficient basis for his 
outright dismissal, effect­ed quite effectively through respondent's 
refusal to give him work.  He should have been investigated first.  We 
are not convinced of complainant's culpability in so serious a charge as
 attempted theft, especially when all that we have at hand is the 
accountant's generalized report on the incident.  We find respondent to 
have acted on the report precipitately and, worse, to have denied 
complainant the elementary courtesy of an investigation."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We are constrained to set aside the orders of the respondent Ministry.  
The orders ignore the circumstances of the situation and penalize the 
employer for acts over which it has no control.  The petitioner's 
assigning another driver to the cargo truck bound for the Coca-Cola 
Plant premises instead of Mr. Apolinario was brought about by the San 
Miguel Corporation ban against Mr. Apolinario prohibiting him from 
entering the Coca-Cola Plant premises.  In the face of such a 
prohibition, the petitioner could not allow Mr. Apolinario to drive its 
cargo truck because it would not have been allowed to enter the 
Coca-Cola Plant.  As the Regional Director stated in his order dated 
January 26, 1978 "x x x It would be a stupid gesture for respondent to 
let complainant continue handling when he is banned from entering the 
Plant Compound."
</p><p>
The Deputy Minister's suggestion for a personal investigation by the 
petitioner as regards the theft charge against Apolinario is impractical
 under the circumstances.  It would have served no purpose at all 
vis-a-vis the ban imposed on Apolinario.  On the other hand, Mr. Marquez
 might have lost his entire business with the Coca-Cola Plant.  A 
finding of the petitioner that Apolinario was not guilty as charged 
would not be binding on the San Miguel Corporation since Apolinario was 
not an employee of San Miguel Corporation.  More­over, if he initiated 
the suggested investigation, the petitioner could have prejudiced its 
hauling contract and the jobs of all other drivers for as far as San 
Miguel Corporation was concerned, Mr. Apolinario had already been 
investigated and found guilty of theft as a result of which he was 
banned from entering the Coca-Cola Plant.  The fact that the petitioner 
closed its business during the pendency of this case shows it could not 
have stood up against the giant San Miguel Corporation.  It would have 
been business suicide for the petitioner to initiate the suggested 
investigation.
</p><p>
In M.F. Violago Oiler Tank Trucks v. The National Labor Relations Commission, et al. (117 SCRA 544), we ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A careful consideration of the records before Us shows that 
insofar as respondents Amado Mariano, Ricardo Pasco, Teofilo de Leon, 
and Zosimo Sacdalan are concerned, the petitioner has been made 
accountable for a predicament where it had no partici­pation and to 
answer for circumstances over which it had no control.  Justice, 
fairness, and due process dictate that the questioned decision be 
modified. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span> xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""></span> xxx </p>
  <p> "It was asking too much to have Violago produce the results of a 
formal investigation by Petrophil that the private respondents were 
found guilty of cheating in receiving oil products from Petrophil depots
 and delivering the same to various delivery points.  Petrophil had no 
interest in expending time, money, and effort in conducting a 
full-fledged investigation.  It was wary of certifications that resulted
 in suits against its officials.  The complainants are notits employees.
  As­summing that Violago and its four drivers could have demanded a 
formal investiga­tion under the arrangements with Pet­rophil and, if 
refused, gone to court, Violago must have felt that it would be risking 
its entire hauling contract with Petrophil if it went to that extent.  
Pressed for the kind of evidence re­quired by the respondent commission 
from Violago, Petrophil may have cancelled the entire contract because 
of the for­mally proved dishonesty of a few.  Not only four drivers but 
all employees and the entire fleet would have been idled.  As a matter 
of fact, an affidavit of three constables of the Constabulary Highway 
Patrol Group (CHPG) and a report of investigation shows that respondent 
Zosimo Sacdalan was apprehended on November 6, 1970 for violation of BP.
 Blg. 33, that Sacdalan admitted having diverted a portion of 9,000 
liters of gasoline on one occasion and 2,000 liters out of 8,000 liters 
on another occasion and that the persons who supposedly received the 
diverted gasoline turned out to be fictitious.  The statement of 
Sacdalan during the investigation in Camp Crame was attached to the 
appeal.  Instead of remanding the case for the conduct of hearings or at
 least look­ing further into the factual situation, the respondent 
commission chose to merely copy verbatim the arbiter's findings of 
facts. </p>
  <p> "The fact that the four drivers went against their employer who 
had no command or control over Pe­trophil when it would have been a 
simpler matter to show that they were free to haul Petrophil products 
and that Violago dismissed then for fancied or non-existent reasons 
shows that the evidence presented by the petitioner was not only 
adequate but also credible."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to the Solicitor General and the Citizen's Legal Assistance 
Office, acting as private respondent's counsel, the fact that Mr. 
Apolinario was not given another assignment other than the trucks 
servicing San Miguel Corporation confirms the view that he was 
unlawfully dismissed by the petitioner.  The records show that the 
private respondent did not raise this matter in the proceeding below.  
There is no showing that Marquez, Inc. serviced other corporations or 
that Mr. Apolinario would have been welcome to carry cargoes of these 
corporations.  The allegations in the complaint are clear to the effect 
that Mr. Apolinario was asking for reinstatement to his former position 
as driver of the cargo truck he used to drive prior to his alleged 
illegal dismissal.  This fact is con­firmed by the Order of the Deputy 
Minister reinstating him to his former position.  Whether or not he 
should have been assigned to other routes was not touched upon in the 
order.  This is a factual issue which should have been raised and 
threshed out in the proceed­ings below.
</p><p>
The records, however, show that the petitioner ceased operations on 
January 3, 1980.  Mr. Apolinario, not having been dismissed by his 
employer is entitled to separation pay and other benefits which the 
other employees may have received as a result of the em­ployer's 
cessation of business operations.  This decision is without prejudice to
 any such benefits which shall be computed as of April 25, 1978 the date
 when Mr. Apolinario stopped working.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the Orders dated July 14, 1981 and January 11, 1983 of the 
Deputy Minister of Labor are hereby set aside and the Order dated 
January 26, 1978 of the Regional Director dismissing private 
res­pondents complaint is reinstated.  The dispositive portion of the 
January 26, 1978 order is hereby modified by directing the petitioner to
 grant separation pay to private respondent equivalent to one-half month
 pay for every year of service and other benefits which the other 
employees may have received as a result of peti­tioner's cessation of 
business operations, such benefits to be computed as of April 25, 1978 
the date when private respondent stopped working.  The temporary 
restraining order dated May 7, 1983 issued in connection with the 
instant petition is lifted.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
