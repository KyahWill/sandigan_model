				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i> with prayer for preliminary injunction and
restraining order seeking to annul the order of the Court of First Instance
(now Regional Trial Court) of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
dated <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as culled from the pleadings, are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioners Filipinas Mills, Inc., Buenaventura Tan and Virginia <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>-Tan obtained a loan from Citizens Bank and Trust
Company (CBTC) in the amount of P70<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> with
interest at the rate of 14% per annum to be paid on or before <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1976</st1:date>, as evidenced by a
promissory note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, despite repeated
demands, said loan remained unpaid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, private respondent Associated Citizens Bank (ACB), which
acquired all the assets and obligations of CBTC by virtue of an Agreement of
Merger, filed a complaint before the Court of First Instance of Manila for
collection of the indebtedness of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although notice was sent to petitioners, they failed to appear at the
scheduled pre-trial and trial on <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="7">July
 11, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they were
considered in default and ACB was allowed to present its evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">parte</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>(p. 18, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1980</st1:date>,
the trial court ruled in favor of ACB, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which, reads (<u>ibid</u>):</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered <span style="">in </span>favor of the plaintiff and against
the defendants, ordering the latter to pay the former, jointly and severally,
the sum of P70<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, with interest at the rate of
14% per annum from March 16, 1976, the maturity date of the promissory note,
until fully paid, plus the sum of P3,000.00 for attorney's fees, and the costs
of suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1981</st1:date>,
a writ of execution was issued pursuant to the aforementioned decision (p. 19, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 10, 1981</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, the Deputy Sheriff levied on the personal properties of
petitioners (p. 20, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, petitioner Buenaventura Tan
directed the Deputy Sheriff in writing to levy first on their shares of stocks
at ACB before levying on their other personal properties (p. 21, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February
16, 1981, a notice of garnishment was issued on the goods, effects, interests,
credits, moneys, stocks, shares, any interests in stocks and shares, and any
other personal property in the possession or under the control of ACB belonging
to petitioners; all debts owed by ACB to petitioners; and specially the shares
of stocks, savings accounts, current accounts, time deposits and all money
placements belonging to petitioners (p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="2">February
 23, 1981</st1:date>, a notice of sale on execution of personal properties of
petitioners was issued but their (petitioners) shares of stocks were not
included in the items for sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The date
of the public auction was set on <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="3">March
 5, 1981</st1:date> (pp. 23-24, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 4, 1981, petitioners filed an urgent motion to cancel
the scheduled public auction sale alleging:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>1) that they have the right to direct the Deputy Sheriff that their
shares of stocks be levied and sold first, citing Section 21, Rule 39 of the
Rules of Court and People v. Hernandez, 59 Phil. 343; and 2) that the notice of
public auction did not comply with the requirements of publication (pp. 25-28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 8,
1981, ACB filed an opposition to petitioners' motion contending that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) Section 21, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court
is inapplicable because it refers to actual execution sale as distinguished
from levy; 2) the case of People v. Hernandez, <u>supra</u>, applies only where
there is no legal justification on the part of the judgment creditor to accept;
and 3) the shares of stocks cannot be included in the items to be sold or first
to be levied upon as it is prohibited under Section 24 of the General Banking
Act (p. 31-33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1981</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an order denying petitioners' motion (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1981</st1:date>,
a notice of sale on execution of personal properties of petitioners was issued
anew setting the date of the public auction on <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1981</st1:date> (pp. 34-35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the present
petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1981</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">We</span> issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the
enforcement of the <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1981</st1:date>
order and the conduct of the public auction sale (pp. 37-38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether or not the trial court acted with grave
abuse of discretion <span style="">in </span>having
issued the questioned order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, the parties reiterate their arguments before
the trial court, except with respect to the issue on non-compliance with the
requirements of publication of the notice of public auction sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain petitioners based on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) Section 21, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court,
as construed in People v. Hernandez <u>supra</u>; and 2) non-applicability of
Section 24 of the General Banking Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 21, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 21.</span> How property sold on
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Who </span>may direct manner and order of <span class="GramE">sale.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- All sales of property under execution must
be made at public auction, to the highest bidder, between the hours of nine in
the morning and five in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After sufficient property has been sold to satisfy the execution, no
more shall be sold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the sale is of
real property, consisting of several known lots, they must be sold separately;
or, when a portion of such real property is claimed by a third person, he may
require it to be sold separately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the sale is of personal property capable of manual delivery, it must be sold
within view of those attending the sale and in such parcels as are likely to
bring the highest price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>judgment</u>
<u>debtor,</u> <u>if</u> <u>present</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>sale,</u> <u>may</u>
<u>direct</u> <u>the</u> <u>order</u> <u>in</u> <u>which</u> <u>property,</u> <u>real</u>
<u>or</u> <u>personal</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>sold,</u> <u>when</u> <u>such</u>
<u>property</u> <u>consists</u> <u>of</u> <u>several</u> <u>known</u> <u>lots</u>
<u>or</u> <u>parcels</u> <u>which</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>sold</u> <u>to</u>
<u>advantage</u> <u>separately</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither the officer holding the execution, nor his deputy, can become a
purchaser, nor be interested directly or indirectly in any purchase at such
sale." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">No doubt, this section grants to a
judgment debtor the right to direct the order in which real or personal
property shall be sold, <u>during</u> the public auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, interpreting this particular provision
in the case of People v. Hernandez, <u>supra</u>, <span class="GramE"><b>We</b></span>
expanded the scope of said right of a judgment debtor to include the case of
attachment/levy (or prior to the public auction sale):</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question <span style="">that </span>a sheriff may attach the property of a judgment or
execution debtor if he is clothed with the necessary authority under a judicial
writ, as provided for in section 453 of Act No. 190.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it should not be construed to mean
that, having discretion in choosing the property to be attached, he should
necessarily levy upon such property as is valued by the execution debtor,
particularly when the latter places other property at his disposal, as was done
herein, the value of which is greatly in excess of the amount of the judgment
under execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>aforesaid</u>
<u>provision</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>forbid</u> <u>the</u> <u>execution</u>
<u>debtor,</u> <u>in</u> <u>case</u> <u>he</u> <u>has</u> <u>sufficient</u> <u>property</u>
<u>to</u> <u>answer</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>payment</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>judgment,</u> <u>to</u> <u>point</u> <u>out</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>sheriff</u>
<u>which</u> <u>of</u> <u>such</u> <u>property</u> <u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>attached</u>
<u>and</u> <u>sold</u> <u>to</u> <u>satisfy</u> <u>the</u> <u>judgment</u> <u>with</u>
<u>the</u> <u>proceeds</u> <u>thereof</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, it may be inferred from the provisions of section 457
of the aforesaid Act that there would be no irregularity committed by such
procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that,
after describing the manner in which the personal property <span style="">of </span>the execution debtor should be sold
at public auction, the last sentence of the afore-cited section reads as
follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"'The judgment debtor, if present at the sale, may direct the
order in which property, real or personal, shall be sold, when such property
consists of several known lots or parcels of articles which can be sold to
advantage separately, and the officer must follow such directions.’<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If this is permissible, and it is being followed in all
cases, why may not the same be done in the case <span style="">of </span>an attachment when there are several properties that may be
attached and, furthermore, their value is sufficient to answer for the amount
of the judgment?" (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied) (pp.
353-­354, <u>ibid</u>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 24 of the General Banking Act (Republic Act No. 337)
provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 24.</span> No commercial bank shall
make any loan or discount on the security of shares of its own capital stock,
nor be the purchaser or holder of any such shares, <u>unless</u> <u>such</u> <u>security</u>
<u>or</u> <u>purchase</u> <u>be</u> <u>necessary</u> <u>to</u> <u>prevent</u> <u>loss</u>
<u>upon</u> <u>a</u> <u>debt</u> <u>previously</u> <u>contracted</u> <u>in</u> <u>good</u>
<u>faith</u>, and the stock so purchased or acquired, <u>or</u> <u>purchased</u>
<u>or</u> <u>acquired</u> <u>for</u> <u>any</u> <u>other</u> <u>reason</u> <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> <u>course</u> <u>of</u> <u>its</u> <u>operations</u>, shall, within <span style="">six </span>months from the time of its
purchase or acquisition, be sold or disposed of at public or private sale, or
in default thereof, a receiver shall be appointed to close up the business of
the bank in accordance with law." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span>
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">ACB must have misread this provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is plain enough that there is a
"specific” exception ("unless such security or purchase be necessary
to prevent loss upon a debt previously contracted in good faith") and <span style="">a </span>"general" exception
("or purchased or acquired for any other reason in the course of its
operations") mentioned therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, if and when ACB decide to purchase those shares of stocks in the
public auction sale definitely, this circumstance will not result in a
violation of Section 24 of the General Banking Act <span style="">as </span>it is allowed under the "general" exception.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was, therefore, a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the
trial court for having denied the motion filed by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A<span style=""> </span>court
of law is competent to control the acts of its officers in the execution of its
process and when an officer has been guilty of irregularities in connection therewith,
to the injury of parties having an interest in the action, it should correct
such irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the
trial court should have cancelled the scheduled public auction sale because the
Deputy Sheriff defied the directive of petitioners to levy and sell <span style="">first their </span>shares of stocks.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of the trial court dated <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1981</st1:date> is SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court is directed to include
petitioners’ shares of stocks at Associated Citizens Bank in the public auction
sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">temporary </span>restraining order is made PERMANENT.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
