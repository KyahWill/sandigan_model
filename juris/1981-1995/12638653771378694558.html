				<H3>TIMOTEO POJAS, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE MERCEDES GOZO-DALOLE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT JUDGE, CITY OF TAGBILARAN, IRENEA POJAS, CESARIA LAGROSA AND CORNELIA BETINOL, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> with
preliminary injunction, petitioner seeks the annulment of the July 15, 1986
Order of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>,
Branch I, presided by herein respondent judge, denying the Notice of Appeal in
Civil Case No. 3430 for being filed out of time; and the July 29, 1986 Order <span style="">of the same court denying the motion for
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1981</st1:date>,
private respondents filed with the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>,
Branch I, a complaint for recovery of possession with writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction, against herein petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same was amended several times until a
Second Amended Complaint dated <st1:date year="1981" day="12" month="7">July
 12, 1981</st1:date> was filed and admitted by the court in its order of <st1:date year="1981" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1981</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
15-20).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1981</st1:date>, petitioner filed his Answer to the second
amended complaint (<span class="GramE"><u>Ibid</u>.,</span> 21-23).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge, after trial, in her decision of <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1986</st1:date>, ruled in favor of
private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said decision,
among others, declared that private respondents <span class="SpellE">Irenea</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pojas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cesaria</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Logrosa</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
are the lawful owners of parcel no. 1 and one-half portion of parcel no. 2 of
the questioned property, and ordered petitioner to vacate and deliver the possession
thereof to private respondent Cornelia <span class="SpellE">Betinol</span>, being
the vendee-a-retro of the same <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.,
</span>p. 30).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said decision was
received by petitioner's counsel on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="4">April
 15, 1986</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp. 35-37) was denied <span style="">in </span>the Order of May 8, 1986 for
failure to mention the day the motion is to be resolved, which was considered <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 5, Rule 15 of the New Rules of Court
and therefore, a mere scrap of paper (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 38).</p>

<p class="BODY">His second motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1986</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 39) was denied
in respondent judge's order of <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="6">June
 20, 1986</st1:date> for lack of merit (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 86).</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 2, 1986, petitioner, after receipt of said order of June
20, 1986, on July 1, 1986 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 4) filed a Notice of Appeal <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p. 42); but the same
was denied <span style="">in </span>an order dated
July 15, 1986, for being filed out of time (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 9) on the ground
that the motion for reconsideration which the Court ruled as <u><span style="">pro-</span></u><u><span style="">forma</span></u><span style=""> </span>did not
stop the running of the 15-day period to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1986</st1:date> order and a supplemental pleading
thereto (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 12-13), but respondent judge in her order of <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1986</st1:date>, denied the same (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the <span style="">instant petition.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue <span style="">in </span>this
case is whether or not the public respondent judge acted in grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or in excess of jurisdiction in denying
petitioner's Notice of Appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer is in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4 of Rule 15 of <span style="">the
</span>Rules of Court requires that notice of motion be served by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> on all parties concerned at least three (3) days
before its hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of the
same Rule provides that the notice shall be directed to the parties concerned, and
shall state the time and place for the hearing of the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion which does not meet the requirements
of Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 15 of the Rules of Court is considered a worthless
piece of paper which the clerk has no right to receive and the court has no
authority to act upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Service of copy
of a motion containing notice of the time and place of hearing of said motion
is a mandatory requirement (<span class="SpellE">Fecundo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Berjame</span>, G.R. 88015, December 18, 1989), and the failure of
the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> to comply with said requisites renders his
motion fatally defective (New Japan Motors, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Perucho</span>,
74 SCRA 14 [1974]; Filipinas Fabricators &amp; Sales, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Magsino</span>, 157 SCRA 469 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner's motion for reconsideration filed on April 23,
1986 which failed to mention the day the motion is asked to be resolved, is a
mere scrap of paper, being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 5,
Rule 15 of the Rules of Court (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 38), and as
such, did not stop the running of the period of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without such notice, the motion is <u><span style="">pro</span></u><span style=""> <u>forma</u>, </span>and hence, does not suspend the running <span style="">of </span>the period of appeal (<span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span> v. Ramirez, G.R. 45447, September 28, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise untenable is petitioner's contention that respondent judge
in refusing to entertain the April 25, 1986 Motion for Reconsideration for
being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of
Court and later denying said motion for lack of merit is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from declaring the same motion as <u>pro-forma</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As ruled by this Court, in the case of
Filipinas Fabricators &amp; Sales, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Magsino</span>
(157 SCRA 469, 475 [1988]) -</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
the fact that the court had taken cognizance of the defective motion first, by
requiring the parties to set it for hearing and second, when it denied the same
for lack of merit in its omnibus motion, did not cure the defect nor alter the
nature of the defective motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b><span class="GramE">,</span> the instant
petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
