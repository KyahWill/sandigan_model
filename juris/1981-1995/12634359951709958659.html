<p class="BODY">On August 22, 1991, appellant moved to quash the information in
Criminal Case No. 10528-MN on the ground that the offense charge therein, that
of illegal possession of a regulated drug, is absorbed in and is necessarily
included as an element of the offense of unlawful sale of such regulated drug
for which accused likewise stands charged.  The resolution of the motion was deferred by the trial court until such
time when all the evidence for the three cases shall have been adduced.</p>

charges against him, after which the three cases were tried jointly by the

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that on July 18, 1991,
Cpl. Eddie Regalado of the Anti-Narcotics Unit of the Malabon Police Station
received information from their confidential informant that there was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>in the house of a certain Rolando Salamat.  On the basis thereof, Cpl. Regalado,
together with Pat. Alberto Nepomuceno, applied for and was subsequently issued
a search warrant by Judge  Amanda
Valera-Cabigao on the same day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 22, 1991, at around 7:00 A.M., a police team composed of
Cpl. Eddie Regalado, Pats. Nepomuceno, Guevarra, Galang, Sales and Olog,
accompanied by the confidential informant, proceeded to the house of the
suspect, herein appellant Rolando Salamat, at No. 127 Interior Sanciangco
Street, Catmon, Malabon in order to effect service of the search warrant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A buy-bust operation was first conducted with Pat. Nepomuceno acting
as poseur-buyer in the company of the confidential informant.  While the two were walking towards the
house, they were met by appellant who was then coming out of the house.  Pat. Nepomuceno testified that appellant
already knew him because he had on two occasions previously <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">bought </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">shabu</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">from the
latter as part of the surveillance being then conducted on appellant's illegal
activities.  When the accused approached
them, Pat. Nepomuceno told him "tatlong piso lang pare," which means
that he was buying P300.00 worth of </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">shabu</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Appellant went inside the house and came
back a few minutes thereafter and handed over the </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">shabu</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> to Pat.
Nepomuceno who paid appellant with the P300.00 marked bills.  After examining the suspected </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">shabu,</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Pat.
Nepomuceno lighted his cigarette as a pre-arranged signal to his companions,
then around ten meters away, to move in.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, appellant resisted arrest and was able to run inside the
house and lock himself inside.  The
raiding team introduced themselves as policemen but were instead met with
gunshots coming from the house.  At
about the same time, the policemen saw several men coming from the back of the
house and running towards a place called Palmario.  Thereafter, when the policemen gave an order for him to
surrender, appellant came out of the house and threw a gun on the ground.  Sgt. Guevarra immediately took the gun while
Pat. Nepomuceno handcuffed appellant.  The policemen showed the search warrant to appellant who merely kept
silent.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There were two houses searched by the policemen, the first of
which is located at 127 Sanciangco Street where appellant was apprehended and
another located at 139 Interior Sanciangco Street which <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">is </span>around twenty meters away from the first house.  As a result of the search made, the police were
able to confiscate ten packets of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>contained in an eyeglass container
and several paraphernalia from the first house, and three packets of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>and additional paraphernalia from the second house,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as a copy of a search warrant issued against one Susana Ignacio and a
receipt for the items seized from her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The receipts for the items seized from the two houses<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
were signed by Barangay Captain Florentino Cruz who was present during the
search.  The common-law wife of
appellant, Marilou Salamat, also signed the receipt for the items taken from
the second house at 139 Interior Sanciangco Street.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> </span>Appellant
was duly furnished copies of the receipts by the policemen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was then brought to the police station where he was
investigated and subsequently detained.  The items confiscated as a result of the search and the buy-bust
operation were turned over to the NBI Forensic Chemist who subsequently issued
a report with the finding that the specimens submitted for examination were
positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride, or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant testified that in the morning of
July 22, 1991, he was in the house of Rolando Cabangis at 127 Interior
Sanciangco Street, Catmon, Malabon, where he was examining a ring which Cabangis
was selling to him, when he heard gunshots outside.  When he went out of the house, he was suddenly grabbed by Pat
Nepomuceno and later brought to the police station together with Cabangis.  He was informed of the charges against him
only after he was detained at the police station.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The following day, only Cabangis was released from jail.  It was his wife, Marilou, who told him that
the policemen searched their house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denies that he sold <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>to Pat. Nepomuceno and claims that
maybe the reason why he was so charged <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was
</span>because the father of Pat. Nepomuceno previously filed a case against
him for robbery in band but the same was subsequently dismissed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
He also denies that the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>and paraphernalia confiscated by the
police from his house belongs to him.  He contends that the signature of Marilou Solis Salamat appearing on one
of the receipts, marked in evidence as Exhibit C, is not her true
signature.  While he admits that there
are several pushers in their place, appellant denies that he is a pusher.  He, however, admits that he knows the house
of Cabangis at 127 Interior Sanciangco Street is often used for
"jamming" or "pot sessions" whenever the latter is not
around.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Marilou Salamat testified that no search warrant was presented to
her when the police searched the house at 139 Interior Sanciangco Street, and
denies that she signed a receipt for the items confiscated therefrom.  She also denies that the signature over the
typewritten name of Marilou Solis Salamat appearing in Exhibit C belongs to
her.  On rebuttal, however, Cpl.
Regalado declared that he was present when the search warrant was presented to
Marilou Salamat by Sgt. Guevarra and when she signed Exhibit C in the presence
of the barangay captain and the father of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">appellant.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal before us is only that portion of the judgment of the
trial court finding herein appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of a
violation of Section 16, Article III of Republic Act No. 6425 for unlawful sale
of a regulated drug.  Since appellant has
been acquitted of the offense of illegal possession of a regulated drug and of
firearms and ammunitions, we deem it unnecessary to dwell on the issue raised
by appellant anent the validity of the search warrant used in this case
considering that it was for the charge of illegal possession of prohibited
drugs and paraphernalia, of which appellant was acquitted in Criminal Case No.
10528-MN, that the evidence obtained pursuant thereto was offered.  We shall nonetheless discuss hereafter the
propriety of appellant's acquittal in said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main contention of appellant in the case at bar actually
hinges on the credibility of the testimony of Pat. Nepomuceno.  If it were true that Pat. Nepomuceno did buy
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>from him on two occasions prior to the incident subject of this
case, appellant then contends that (1) it was improbable for Pat. Nepomuceno
not to have remembered the exact dates when he previously bought <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>from appellant; (2) the testimony of said witness that he did
not know appellant prior to July 22, 1991 is not true; (3) it is highly
questionable why the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>allegedly bought from appellant on
those two occasions were not presented before the court; and (4) it is
surprising why the witness had a hard time describing and identifying the house
subject of the search warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, appellant would make capital of the fact that since
he has known Pat. Nepomuceno as a policeman for almost five years, it was
unlikely and highly improbable for him to sell <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>to the
latter.  Besides, he adds, the fact that
Pat. Nepomuceno is the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">son </span>of
Col. Nepomuceno who filed a case against appellant, but which case was later
dismissed, is sufficient basis to cast doubt on the motives of Pat. Nepomuceno
in implicating him in the aforestated charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the issues raised are factual and involve the
credibility of the witnesses, a matter addressed to the trial court because it
is in a better position to decide such questions, having heard the witnesses
and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.  Hence, to once again reiterate an entrenched
doctrine, its findings on the credibility of witnesses are entitled to the
highest degree of respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of
any clear showing that the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied
some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which would have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">affected the result of the case.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> That absence is only </span>all too evident
in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the testimony of appellant consists merely of
denials without any other evidence to sustain his claim and defense.  We have consistently ruled that denials if
unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence are negative, self-serving
evidence which deserve no weight in law and cannot be given greater evidentiary
weight over the testimony of credible witnesses who testify on affirmative
matters.  As between the positive
declarations of the prosecution witness and the negative statements of an
accused, the former deserves more credence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Next, the alleged failure of prosecution witness Pat. Nepomuceno
to remember the exact dates when he previously bought <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>from
appellant is too trivial an omission as could cast doubt on his
credibility.  Discrepancies and
inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses referring to minor details, and
not upon the basic aspects of the crime, do not impair their credibility.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Contradictions on minor or trivial details are not unnatural and are normally
considered as enhancing, rather than debilitating, the testimony of a witness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, credence is generally accorded to the testimonies of prosecution
witnesses who are enforcers of the law as they are presumed to have performed
their duties in a regular manner, more <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">so
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">where, as in this case,
appellant has opted to invoke the inherently weak and standard defense of
denial.  It is axiomatic, under the
rules of evidence, that said defenses cannot prevail when arrayed against the
positive testimonies of prosecution witnesses.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that appellant has known the poseur-buyer as a policeman
for almost five years cannot be considered as a strong deterrent which would
prevent the former from entering into illegal transactions with the
latter.  As this Court has noted many
times, drug pushers have become increasingly daring in the operation of their
illicit trade and have not hesitated to act openly, almost casually and even in
scornful violation of the law, in selling prohibited drugs to any and all
buyers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> In
real life, pushers, especially small-quantity or retail pushers, sell their
prohibited wares to customers, be they strangers or not, who have the price of
the drug, and this fact the Court has recognized.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, it will be noted that Pat. Nepomuceno had on two occasions bought <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">shabu</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>from appellant as part <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of
</span>a test-buy operation which was primarily intended to gain appellant's
confidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, appellant would like to impute ill motives to Pat.
Nepomuceno in testifying against him.  Such allegation is nothing more than a desperate effort on the part of
appellant to exculpate himself from liability.  We have said that motive is important when the identity of an accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>in doubt, but when the perpetrator
has been positively identified, as in this case, even discounting such motive
there is enough evidence to convict appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the police officers
were induced by any motive other than to accomplish their mission to capture a
drug pusher in the execution of the crime, the presumption being that police
officers perform their duties regularly in the absence of any evidence to the
contrary.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We now digress, as earlier indicated, to make our observations on
the acquittal of appellant in Criminal Case No. 10528-MN where he was charged
with the illegal "possession, custody and control" of thirteen
packets of methamphetamine hydrochloride, separately from the sale of said
regulated drug worth P300,00 charged in Criminal Case No. 10529-MN.  In acquitting appellant in the first case,
the court below made the following ratiocination:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court, however, is not inclined to sustain the charge of
illegal possession of additional shabu and paraphernalia to facilitate its sale
and consumption.  A trader, whether he

punished by section 31 of the Act, and another, to sell opium, penalized by
section 5 of the same Act before cited.</blockquote>

would have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">interesting to
see how the theory adopted by the trial court would have fared if appellant had
also been acquitted of the charge of selling such drug.  Hence, we direct our trial courts to take
particular note of this clarificatory emphasis on the matter, to avoid another
miscarriage of justice with its consequent setback to the operose campaign
against dangerous drugs in this country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the gaffes which continue to reach us on appeal, as in

<p class="2Q">'The Code (Revised Penal code) does not prescribe the penalty of
life imprisonment for any of the felonies therein defined, that penalty being
invariably imposed for serious offenses penalized not by the Revised Penal Code
but by special law.  <i>Reclusion perpetua</i>
entails imprisonment for at least thirty (30) years after which the convict
becomes eligible for pardon.  It also
carries with it accessory penalties, namely:  perpetual special disqualification, etc.  It is not the same as 'life imprisonment' which, for one thing,
does not carry with it any accessory penalty, and for another, does not appear
to have any definite extent or duration.'<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
