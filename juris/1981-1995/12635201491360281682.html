a fire broke out at what is known as Juana's Store located on the western side
of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.
The fire spread northward, engulfing the next store, the Novelty Store and the <span class="SpellE">Masing's</span> Store and, finally, the Municipal Building of <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, which occupied the western corner of 19 <span class="SpellE">Martirez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Streets. The
fire also spread to two doors to the south, until it reached the <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> Tong <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> Store, which was

<blockquote>"When this fire at the eastern side of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>

  street</st1:address></st1:street>, razing to the ground several houses,
burning, practically, the entire business section of <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should also be mentioned that opposite the municipal building

stands the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Abanilla</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>. These three structures
are immediately adjacent to one another and had interconnecting doors and
access to and from the <span class="SpellE">Laserna</span> Drug Store, the dining
room and kitchen of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The store owned by appellant known as the New Plaza Bazaar is
located in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Laserna</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> on the eastern corner of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and <st1:street><st1:address>19 <span class="SpellE">Martirez</span>

The rear of the New Plaza Bazaar is connected to its dining room and thence to
the kitchen. There are doors and corridors leading from the <span class="SpellE">Laserna</span>
Drug Store to said dining room and kitchen. Appellant's kitchen is actually
located in the rear of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Abanilla</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> from where there is also
ac­cess to appellant's kitchen. Presumably, the "kitchen" is a
restaurant as it adjoins other "kitchens" towards the south belonging
to other individuals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case for the prosecution during the original trial centered
on the testimonies of Jose NARCE, Guillermo VIDAL, <span class="SpellE">Coronacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> <span class="SpellE">Motus</span>.</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We find that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Coronacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> cannot be taken as positive identification
of the appellant, because she never stated that she saw appellant in the
kitchen, but that she only heard a voice which she recognized to be that of
appel­lant."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Coronacion</span><span style="mso-tab-count:

fire, she was a cook at Chin Guan store adjacent to that of appellant. While
evacuating some goods from said store to a clump of bananas some 25 meters
away, she heard some one from appellant's kitchen, saying 'o-o-oh' and
recognized the voice to be that of appellant. She then noticed fire and smoke
in appellant's kitchen. She immediately ran outside and shouted '<span class="SpellE">Wasing</span> (appellant) again burned his kitchen'. Looking to
the left, she saw flames leaping from appellant's kitchen door. She then ran to
the place where she had left her personal belongings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The gist of the testimony of NARCE, then 22 years old, single, a
houseboy, who reached only Grade I, during the origi­nal trial was that he
knows only how to write his name; that at the time of the fire, he was a
houseboy of Blanding and <span class="SpellE">Amading</span> <span class="SpellE">Kimpo</span>;
that when he heard the bells ringing, he went out to the street and saw the
fire at Juana's store. Having been a houseboy of the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span>
for three years, he proceeded to the drugstore of his former employers to help
evacuate the medicines and other things. He recognized appellant who was
dressed in white shirt and pants also going back and forth evacuating his
things. On his third trip from the second floor, NARCE saw appellant pick up
the lighted kerosene lamp from a table near the stairs and thereafter bring the
lamp to the dining room adjoining. The witness followed appellant to the dining
room and while he was about two <span class="SpellE">armslengths</span> from him
(appellant), the latter removed the glass funnel of the lamp, increased the
flame and placed said lamp on one of the shelves where there were boxes of
shoes. When the accused left, NARCE transferred the lamp to a table and took
some shoes and merchandise to the plaza. When he returned, he passed by the
kitchen door intend­ing to hide some shoes for himself when he saw appellant
holding a can of petroleum with one side raised and afterwards lighting a match
and placing it on a pile of wood. Black smoke then rose and red flames
followed. Fearful of what he saw, NARCE ran away and went to the bodega of one
Garcia where he used to sleep. Two days later or on the following Tuesday,
NARCE told Dr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Iluminado</span> <span class="SpellE">Motus</span>
at the house of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Motus</span>' mother about appellant's
having set fire to his kitchen.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">NARCE's</span> Affidavit of Retraction
executed on April 8, 1965, sworn to before Vicente S. <span class="SpellE">Ocol</span>,
Clerk of Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, he stated that the
"facts" he had testified to were not true and that he had testified
under pressure from the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span> who promised to give
him work, and that "in conscience, I have to right the wrong I have done
and do justice to the innocent".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the new trial, NARCE, then 35 years old, testified that
after he heard the bells warning of the fire, he went to the plaza and stood at
the bandstand and saw the fire at Juana's store; that flames were flying all
around; that fire was seen from the kitchen of <span class="SpellE">Abanilla</span>;
that when he went down from the bandstand he met Dr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Motus</span> whom he helped gather medi­cines. NARCE emphasized
that he did not go to the drugstore. He also declared that during the original
trial he testified upon the prodding of the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span>
and upon promise of a job and that he would be given P200.00 if they win the
case; that he, VIDAL, and <span class="SpellE">Coronacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> were coached by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>
Francisco at the <span class="SpellE">Motus</span> residence; and that when he
executed the Affidavit of retraction he was working on and off in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City and lived with one <span class="SpellE">Ambrocio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Medel</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to how he happened to execute said Affidavit, he tes­tified
that he met the accused accidentally in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> who
told him "as if you kill me when you testify in the trial in <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, I did not do anything in connection with that
fire" and that if NARCE sympathized with him, the former should help
because he would be staying for 30 years in jail and might die there. Appellant
further told him that VIDAL had already executed an affidavit, and because of
that NARCE felt "bolstered". NARCE did not have a permanent job at
that time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">NARCE's</span> Affi­davit was thereafter prepared at the house of

and he swore to the same before the Clerk of Court of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City. The contents of the
Affidavit were translated to NARCE by <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> <span class="SpellE">Medel</span>, a driver, and with whom he was living.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Medel</span> was also jobless at the time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to VIDAL. This Court in its Decision in L-16379
synthesized his testimony during the original trial when he was then 20 years
old, married, a laborer, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Guillermo Vidal testified that while the fire on the western
side of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>
was raging, he helped the family of Dr. and Mrs. Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Mirto</span>
(another fire victim) evacuate their personal belongings from their house,
which was near the appellant's store. After most of the <span class="SpellE">Mirto's</span>
per­sonal belongings had been evacuated, they told him to help in the
evacuation of the effects of the <span class="SpellE">Laserna</span> Drugstore,
which was next door to appellant's store. As he approached the kitchen of
appellant to go to the <span class="SpellE">Laserna</span> Drugstore, he saw
appel­lant, in white trousers and shirt, bending over a pile of firewood in his
kitchen. Suddenly, flame and smoke rose from the firewood. Due to fear, he
turned back and ran to the plaza. He there found the <span class="SpellE">Mirtos</span>
attending to their children and belongings, but he did not tell them or anybody
else of the incident he saw in appel­lant's kitchen. Because he got wet by the
rain that fell on the night of the fire, he contracted fever which lasted for
about 5 days. While reco­vering from the fever, his father visited him, and it
was to him that he told that the fire which destroyed several houses of <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span> came from the kitchen of appellant and was set by
the latter. His father then advised him not to tell anybody about it, to avoid
involvement in its conse­quences. Notwithstanding his father's advice, however,
he told Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Mirto</span> about the aforesaid incident at
appel­lant's kitchen, when he saw her one day weeping and lamenting on the loss
of her house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his Affidavit of retraction executed on February 18, 1965, and
sworn to before Gregorio L. Lira, Clerk of Court, Court of First Instance of
Iloilo, he stated that his testimony during the original trial that he saw
appellant as the one in­side the kitchen setting fire to a pile of firewood and
papers in his kitchen, was a mere guess and that he testified the way he did
upon the urgings of the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Mirtos</span>, who were among the victims in the <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span> fire, and whom he could not refuse due to the many
favors they had showered on him; and that in the conflicting emotions between
gratitude and peace of mind he "had to ease and clear my conscience and to
do jus­tice to the innocent".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the new trial, VIDAL, then 36 years old, married, al­ready a
public school teacher in elementary education, declared that the second fire
started from the <span class="SpellE">Abanilla</span> kitchen which he had seen
from the window of the second storey of the <span class="SpellE">Mirto</span>
residence. He declared that he did not go to the drugstore of the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span> nor was he instructed by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Mirto</span>
to help the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span> although he helped in saving <span class="SpellE">Mirto</span> properties. He allegedly pinpointed appellant upon
the urgings of his benefactors, the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span>, who gave
him a job after enduring hardship in his former employment after his stint with
the <span class="SpellE">Mirtos</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On how he happened to execute his Affidavit, he stated that while
he was on vacation in <span class="SpellE">Batan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>,
as he was then residing in <span class="SpellE">Ampatuan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>, he met the accused accidentally in <span class="SpellE">Kalibo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aklan</span>. The accused told
him that "because you have testified in the trial and now I will be
sentenced for 30 years imprisonment and probably I will die there". As his
conscience was disturbed he told the accused that he would retract. He then
went to <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he met the accused at the Happy Landing Hotel on February 17 where he
showed the draft of the statement that he had prepared to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.
The latter made a slight correction and thereafter they proceed­ed to the Court
of First Instance at <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where the Af­fidavit was typewritten and he subscribed to the same before the

<p class="BODY">As heretofore stated, the function of the lower Court during the
new trial, with which defense counsel was in con­formity, was to determine the
veracity of the recantation of evidence by NARCE and VIDAL. We affirm the lower
Court's find­ing in this regard when it said:</p>

<blockquote>"After painstakingly going over the voluminous record, the
testimonies of Vidal and <span class="SpellE">Narce</span> both during the
original trial and during the new trial on the participation of the accused,
the circumstances under which they were given, especially the cir­cumstances
behind the execution of the affidavits of retraction, the Court has come to the
conclusion that the testimonies of Guillermo Vidal and Jose <span class="SpellE">Narce</span>
during the original trial are true, while those given during the new trial are
afterthoughts to save the accused, thus complying with the purpose of the new
trial, that is to ascertain the truthfulness of the recantation of these wit­nesses."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As between <span class="SpellE">NARCE's</span> two versions, one
given at the original trial and the other at the new trial, that given at the
original trial deserves more credence. As noted by the lower Court:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court had gone over his lengthy testimony during the
original trial. He was able to testify on de­tail about the lay-out of the
premises of the drugstore of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Motus</span> and of the
premises occupied by the ac­cused and the actuations of the ac­cused. An
illiterate man like him, if merely coached to tell a lie, could not possibly
testify on those details and acquit himself during the very detailed and
meticulous cross-examination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The fact that the witness, on cross-examination mentioned
four times on having seen the accused get the lighted lamp near the stairs in
the drugstore of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Motus</span> when the matter was not
directly the subject of inquiry cannot be taken by the court as having answered
as an auto­maton. He was asked on how many times he went up and down the stairs
and if the witness answered in addition that the third time he went down he saw
the accused, it was to clarify the point that it was on that particular going
down that he saw the accused."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">NARCE's</span> allegation during the new trial
that he merely stood at the bandstand of the plaza when the fire was raging
cannot be believed. Even appellant admitted that he saw NARCE at the scene of
the fire running and dropping a pair of <span class="SpellE">Besa</span> shoes in
the process<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>,
thereby negating <span class="SpellE">NARCE's</span> contention that he did not
go to the drugstore of the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span> at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to <span class="SpellE">NARCE's</span> execution of his
Affidavit of retraction, we quote with approval the lower Court's assessment
thereof:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Narce</span> testified that the ac­cused,
upon meeting him in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, said: 'You are here,
Jose. I have been looking for you for a long time'. This speaks of efforts of
the accused to locate the witnesses to get their retraction as an ultimate
remedy for an acquittal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Narce</span> had no permanent job when he
met the accused in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>. He went
there in 1958 to look for work. In fact he told the accused that he was trying
his luck in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> where he might
find a job.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The financial situation of Jose <span class="SpellE">Narce</span>
at the time he met the accused makes the Court suspect that he was an easy prey
to an offer of remuneration in consideration for executing an affidavit of
retraction."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As rebuttal witnesses during the new trial, both Dr. <span class="SpellE">Motus</span> and Mrs. Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Motus</span>
emphatically denied that NARCE had tes­tified originally upon their <span class="SpellE">proddings</span> and upon promise of a job at the Park View Hotel.
As they respectively testified, at the time, that hotel had not yet been
constructed. And if he was employed thereafter it was more likely to help him
with a job and because they needed helpers. The <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span>
learned of what appellant had done when NARCE himself disclosed it to them a
few days after the fire. The <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span> merely told him
to relate what he had seen.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">VIDAL's</span> original testimony is likewise
more credible. As the Trial Court had aptly pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>"Again, like Jose <span class="SpellE">Narce</span>, the
testimony of Guillermo Vidal during the original trial was vivid and detailed
and the witness was able to withstand the very lengthy and meticulous
cross-examination which only one who is telling the truth can withstand."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the new trial, VIDAL declared the he testified for the
prosecution because he was indebted both to the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span>
and to the <span class="SpellE">Mirtos</span>, who had sent him to school<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>,
and that he left the <span class="SpellE">Mirtos</span> because of their
insistence that he should testify. This was rebutted by Dr. Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Mirto</span>, however, who stated that VIDAL left their place and
transferred to the Magnolia Kiosk upon their own suggestion because they could
no longer cope with expenses due to their losses in the fire.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court has held, retraction of witnesses at a new trial
made after a judgment of conviction as in this case is to be taken warily and
to be rejected where rebutted by other witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, even assuming that NARCE and VIDAL owed the <span class="SpellE">Mo­tuses</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Mirtos</span> a debt of
gratitude, it does not necessarily follow that to repay them, they would
testify falsely a­gainst appellant and charge him with a crime as serious as
Arson.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">VIDAL's</span> pretense that he prepared the
draft of his own Affidavit of retraction is negated by the fact that during the
new trial, he even requested the help of an interpreter so he could speak in
"<span class="SpellE">Hiligaynon</span>" because his diction and
expression in English was poor. And yet the Affidavit was in good English. As
the Trial Court had observed:</p>

<blockquote>"It is likewise not believable that the witness who admits he
is short of English and diction would take the trouble of drafting Exhibit 1
knowing that he was to meet Atty. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
the counsel of the accused, who could more easily draft the statement as to
accurately contain what he wanted to be contained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court has reason to suspect that the witness so testified
to impress the Court of his sincerity and of the originality of Exhibit
1."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">VIDAL also denied having received any money from appel­lant in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> so he could meet with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
thereat. The fact remains, however, that he had to stay overnight at the Happy
Landing Hotel in order to be able to meet with said counsel and thereafter had
to go back to <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>. As the Trial Court opined,
"it could not believe that the accused could have allowed the witness who
was to do him a favor to undertake the expenses in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also stresses that the delay of NARCE and VIDAL in
immediately informing other people that appellant had set fire to his own
kitchen proves that their testimony is unworthy of belief. The delay has been
satisfactorily explained, however. Both were seized by fear when they saw what
appellant had done. VIDAL was also afraid of physical harm on his person.
Besides, the evidence shows that NARCE had disclosed to the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span>
two days after the fire what he had witnessed, while VIDAL had also done to the
same to his father first and then to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Mirto</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">That Dr. <span class="SpellE">Motus</span> did not reveal the
information furnished him by NARCE and VIDAL to the PC and the Municipal
Council, of which he was a member, was also explained by him in that he feared
reprisals against the witnesses besides the fact that they might succumb to
pressure, specially considering that investigation was conducted at the bandstand
at the public plaza. The <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span>, instead, preferred
to solicit the aid of the NBI at <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>.
In fact, they brought Jose <span class="SpellE">Narce</span> to the NBI in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
as early as July, 1956, or the month following the fire. <span class="SpellE">NARCE's</span>
affidavit was taken by the NBI and signed before NBI agents. It is to be noted
also that the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Mirtos</span>
adhered to their testimonies during the original trial and did not lose
interest in the case despite the lapse of 23 years from the date of the
occurrence of the fire and the dates of their subsequent testimonies at the new
trial, not to speak of their requests for early resolution in this case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
They would have had no motive to impute the serious crime of Arson to appellant
unless they had been informed by NARCE and VIDAL, respectively. The NBI and the
Fiscal conducted their own respective investigations, which also accounts for
the delay in the filing of the criminal charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their testimonies during the new trial, NARCE and VIDAL also
declared that the second fire started at the <span class="SpellE">Abanilla</span>
building implying that it did not start from appellant's kitchen. That kitchen,
however, is just on the first floor of the <span class="SpellE">Abanilla</span>
building. <span class="SpellE">Coronacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>
also testified at the original trial and confirmed at the new trial that she saw
a sudden burst of fire followed by heavy dark smoke inside the kitchen of the
New Plaza <span class="SpellE">Bazar</span>. True, this Court discounted her
testimony in the Resolution dated <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="8">August
 18, 1972</st1:date>, <u>supra</u>; however, what was rejected was her
identification of appellant and not the rest of her testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also intimates that the <span class="SpellE">Abanilla</span>
fire could have been caused by flames flying from the <span class="SpellE">Masing</span>
store across the street which could have reached the powder and chemicals kept
by <span class="SpellE">Abanilla</span> who was a manufacturer of fireworks and
firecrackers. The evidence does not disclose, however, any explosion which
would surely have occurred if that were the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense contention that the active prosecution of the case
was done by the private prosecutor and, therefore, the evidence presented
cannot be given weight or credit is not deserving of any serious consideration.
While the private prosecutor actively conducted the trial, an Assistant Fiscal
was always present and the proceedings were under his direction and control.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Supplemental Memorandum filed on December 6, 1982,
appellant, through another counsel, Atty. Gil <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Racho</span>, additionally contends that respondent trial
Court erred in failing to make in its Decision findings of fact other than
findings on truthfulness of the recantation considering that the former
judgment was set aside and, therefore, the theory is advanced that the Decision
under review should be declared null and void.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
As already explained, it was this Court that had limited the scope of authority
of the lower Court at the new trial to ascertaining the truthfulness of the
recantation made. This was confirmed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span>
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
in his manifestation before the lower Court prior to the new trial, and
reiterated by Atty. Felix V. <span class="SpellE">Macalalag</span>, who appeared
as colla­borating counsel, that "the Supreme Court sent back the records
to this Court to determine better whether the recantation should be given
faith".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant's brief also admits that "the only issue raised before the Court
of origin of the new trial is whether the recantation made by Vidal and <span class="SpellE">Narce</span> of their testimonies given at the trial are
true".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Further, there is absolutely no basis to the allegation of the
defense in its Supplemental Memorandum that appellant has been denied due
process of law by the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> because of "absence of
evidence on record to support its findings". Basically, the issue is one
of credibility as between the con­tradictory testimonies of NARCE and VIDAL
during the original trial and at the new trial, and our own conclusions support
those of the lower Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's additional argument is that the lower Court erred in
applying the doctrine in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Saliling</span>, 69 SCRA
427 (1976), reading:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
would be a dangerous rule for courts to reject testimonies solemnly taken
before courts of jus­tice simply because the witnesses who had given them later
on change their mind for one reason or another, for such a rule would make
solemn trials a mockery and place the inves­tigation of truth at the mercy of
unscrupulous witnesses. Affidavits of retraction can be easily secured from
poor and ignorant witnesses u­sually for a monetary consideration. Recanted
testimony is exceedingly unreliable. There is always the probability that it
may later be repudiated. So courts are wary or reluc­tant to allow a new trial
based on retracted testimony."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming it to be inapplicable, actually, the ruling in said
case was not the only basis of the Trial Court for re­jecting the recanted
testimonies. That Court made a careful comparison between the original and
retracted testimonies, the circumstances under which they were given, as well
as the mo­tives behind the changes in testimony. Thereby, the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
correctly applied the criteria laid down in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ubina</span>,
et al., 97 Phil. 526, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
rule should be that a testimony solemnly given in court should not be lightly
set aside and that before this can be done, both the previous testimony and the
subse­quent one be carefully compared, the circumstances under which each given
carefully scrutinized, the reasons or motives for the change carefully
scrutinized -- in other words, all the expedients devised by man to determine
the credibility of witnesses should be utilized to determine which of the
contradictory testimonies re­presents the truth."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the Motion for New Trial<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
based on the Affi­davit of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> Francisco
must be denied. As pointed out by the lower Court, if Atty. Francisco conferred
with the witnesses before they were presented, that was but natural. In fact,
the <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span> admitted that Atty. Francisco met with
NARCE, VIDAL, and <span class="SpellE">Coronacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>,
but merely to elicit from them what they knew and not to coach them nor to
coerce them to testify against appellant. The <span class="SpellE">Motuses</span>
and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Mirto</span> all denied having coached NARCE and
VIDAL, respectively, as the latter two alleged during the new trial. In the
words of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Motus</span>, they did not coach NARCE because
"he knows better what he had seen and on what he will testify".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Coronacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> likewise
denied having been coached by either the <span class="SpellE">Mo­tuses</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">Mirtos</span> or Atty. Francisco. She admitted that
Atty. Francisco had convened NARCE, VIDAL and herself and asked them whether
they had knowledge of the case, and when they replied in the affirmative, she
just told them to tell the truth when they testify in Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
And on cross examination, she declared that she had also given a sworn
statement to the NBI, the PC, and the Municipal Council<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>,
thereby negating the defense contention that she was merely "coached"
on how to tes­tify during the original trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the non-presentation by the prosecution of Atty. Francisco
as a rebuttal witness, it manifested that it was due to her senility as she was
then around 80 years of age.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
Although the defense stoutly denies such condition, it is to be noted that
neither did it present her as its own witness to affirm the contents of her
Affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, other than their own self-serving claim, we have found
no evidence to support the assertions of NARCE and VIDAL that during the
original trial they had falsely testified against appellant out of extraneous
considerations such as gra­titude, or because they were coached to testify in a
particular way. Our findings are that their testimonies during the origi­nal
trial represent the truth.</p>
