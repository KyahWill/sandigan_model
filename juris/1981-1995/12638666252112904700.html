				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners impugn the decision of the public respondent Bureau
of Labor Relations (BLR) in BLR Case No. A-10-354-87 (NCR-OD-M-5-421-87) which
affirms the order of the Med-Arbiter declaring as invalid the
disqualification/expulsion of private respondent from the union and modifies
the same order by requiring petitioners to return to the union the amount of
One Hundred Thirty Thousand Pesos (P130,000.00) previously paid by them to
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> III
as attorney’s fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Destura</span> were the then President and Treasurer,
respectively, of San Miguel Corporation Employees Union (SMCEU-PTGWO), a
legitimate labor organization composed of monthly salaried employees of San
Miguel Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Borbon</span> is employed as a Safety Engineer in the Magnolia
Division of the same corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two complaints, docketed as Case Nos. NCR-IRD-C-5-302-87 and
NCR-OD-M-5-421-<span class="GramE">87,</span> were filed with the Med-Arbiter by
private respondent against petitioners in their capacity as union officers of
SMCEU?PTGWO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent
alleged that the following illegal acts were committed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>, as hold-over president of the union:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">arbitrary</span>, summary

pp. 44-45.]<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1987</st1:date>,
the Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz rendered a resolution, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>Wherefore, premises considered, judgment is rendered as follows:</blockquote>

amounts of P500<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; P200,000.00 or P50,000.00
respectively are denied for lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>[Resolution of the Med-Arbiter; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 11]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent appealed item numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the resolution to the BLR, while
petitioners appealed item number 1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1988</st1:date>, public respondent
BLR Director <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer-Calleja</span>
rendered a decision modifying the Med-Arbiter's order as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the ORDER of the Med-Arbiter dated <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="9">18 September 1987</st1:date> is modified to the
extent that respondents <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>,
Jr. and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Destura</span> are hereby ordered to return
to the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> the amount of One Hundred Thirty Thousand
Pesos (P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) that they illegally paid to ATTY.
RAYMUNDO HIPOLITO III, as attorney's or professional services fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>[Decision of the Director of Bureau of
Labor Relations, Annex "B" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 11]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent and the Solicitor General
filed their respective Comments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners thereafter filed their Reply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties submitted their memoranda, after
which the case was deemed submitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">For resolution by the court is whether or not public respondent
committed grave abuse of discretion in (1) holding that private respondent was
illegally dismissed from the union and (2) in ordering petitioners to return to
the union the amount of One Hundred Thirty Thousand Pesos (P130,000.00) which
they had previously paid to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to private respondent's removal from the union,
petitioners claim that private respondent is not a rank and file employee
because he holds the position of safety engineer and as such, exercises
supervisory functions in the corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, in accordance with the union’s rules which disallow the
membership of persons exercising supervisory powers [Article IV, Sections 2 and
9, par. B of the SMCEU constitution and by-laws; Annex "I" to the
Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 68, 73,] private respondent is
disqualified to be a union member.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Public respondent's declaration that private
respondent is a rank and file employee is supported by the evidence.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, there is a certification signed by the
Assistant Vice-President and Personnel and Administrative Manager of San Miguel
Corporation, Magnolia Division [Annex "3" to the Comment; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 118] stating that private respondent occupies a
position that is non-supervisory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Second, private respondent's status as a rank and file employee had been
recognized in two previous related petitions G.R. Nos. 82183 and 80141]
decided by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
decision in G.R. No. 80141 incorporated the resolution in G.R. No. 82183 dated
May 4, 1988 [Annex "5" to the Comment of Private Respondent; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 121] which in part, states: "that
petitioner's petition to disqualify Daniel <span class="SpellE">Borbon</span>
from running for office in the union had already been resolved in BLR Case No.
1-354-87 (NCR OD-M-5-421-87) where <span class="SpellE">Borbon</span> was
declared a rank and file employee, hence, qualified to join, form or assist in
the formation of a labor organization." [SMCEU-PTGWO v. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer-Calleja</span>, G.R. No. 80141, <st1:date year="1989" day="5" month="7">July 5<span class="GramE">,1989</span></st1:date>.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent, therefore, did not commit grave abuse of
discretion when it affirmed the declaration of the Med-Arbiter that private
respondent was a rank and file employee and accordingly, his disqualification
and/or expulsion from the union was invalid.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now resolve the issue of whether or not public respondent
committed grave abuse of discretion when it ordered petitioners to return to
the union the amount of P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> that they
previously paid to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the complaint filed before the Med-Arbiter, the illegal acts
allegedly committed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> included
the unilateral appointment of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> as union
counsel, and the payment to the latter of P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as legal fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to private
respondent, there was no resolution from the union's board of directors either
appointing Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> as counsel or authorizing
the payment of attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
the SMCEU constitution, it is the board of directors which has the power to
engage the services of a legal counsel and to fix his compensation [Section 2,
Article VI; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 75-76.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The Med-Arbiter found that the union's board did not engage the
services of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> as union counsel, but
ruled that the attorney's fees collected, if any, should be considered as
payment for services rendered as a professional.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, public respondent BLR upheld the Med-Arbiter's finding
that the appointment was made without board authority but declared that since
the appointment was <u>ultra</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vires</u></span>, it is
illegal, and therefore Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> is not entitled
to any legal fee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence,
petitioners were ordered to return to the union the amount of P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> paid to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a need to clarify that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
is not asked to return to the union the money paid him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is not even a party to this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the petitioners who have been ordered
to pay back the union the amount of P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the order to return the money
rests on the premise that the payment by petitioners is a case of illegal
disbursement of union funds.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that there was no board resolution
appointing Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> as union counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, however, maintain that the
absence of a board resolution should not negate the fact that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> had rendered service to the union for which he
deserved remuneration.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain petitioners’ argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The record establishes clearly that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
had acted as union counsel in the negotiation and consummation of the 1986
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) entered into between the San Miguel
Corporation management and SMCEU-PTGWO [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
149-150.] The same parties signed a Memorandum of Agreement which outlined the
terms as to wage increase, scope of bargaining unit, and <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the CBA [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 91.] <span class="GramE">These
documents, signed by the members of the board (including private respondent),
evidence two occasions where the members of the board clearly recognized the
representation of the union by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while it is true that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
was not appointed by the board, the facts of the case show that not only did
the board itself acknowledge and make use of the services of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>, but that such services redounded to the benefit
of the union [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 141- 148.] Taken together,
these circumstances, i.e., that notwithstanding the absence of an express
authority from the board, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> represented
the union with the knowledge and acquiescence of the board, and the acceptance
of benefits arising from the service rendered, entitle Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> to the reasonable value of his professional
services on a <b>quantum</b> <span class="SpellE"><b>meruit</b></span> basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">In determining the amount of attorney's fees on <b>quantum</b> <span class="SpellE"><b>meruit</b></span><b>,</b> the Court invariably takes into
account the amount and character of the services rendered, the labor, time and
trouble involved, the nature and importance of the activity in which the
services were rendered, the responsibility imposed, and the results secured
[Delgado v. De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, 43 Phil. 419 (1922); <span class="SpellE">Occena</span> v. Marquez G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-27396, </span><st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 30, 1974</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 60 SCRA 38.]</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, <span class="GramE">We</span> consider the following
facts which remain undisputed on the record:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> served as union counsel in the
1986-1989 CBA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the process of
negotiations, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> had to travel to
different negotiation places and offices [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
131.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For nearly ten months prior to the
conclusion of the CBA, pickets were staged and a strike vote had to be taken [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 22, 131.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon its conclusion, the CBA extended to each covered employee benefits
ranging from a P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> salary increase across the
board to a P2,000.00 mid-year gratuity pay [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 141-148.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of the foregoing,
the Court declares the amount of P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
previously paid to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> to be reasonable
compensation for services rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioners’ payment of P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as legal fees in favor of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> is deemed a
reasonable expenditure of union funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, petitioners need not return the said amount to the union.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Director
of Bureau of Labor Relations in BLR Case No.</span> A-10-354-87 (NCR-OD-M-5-­421-87)
is AFFIRMED insofar as it declares invalid the disqualification/expulsion of
private respondent from the union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
portion of the decision which orders petitioners to return to the union the
amount of One Hundred Thirty Thousand Pesos (P130<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>)
that they paid to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
III as attorney's or professional services fees is hereby SET ASIDE.</p>
