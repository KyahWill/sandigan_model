P5,000.00 [Art. 172, Revised Penal Code (RPC).] Being punishable by a
correctional penalty, this crime prescribes in ten (10) years [Art. 90, par. 3
(RPC).] The ten (10) year prescriptive period commences to run "from the
day on which the crime is discovered by the offended party, the authorities, or
their agents . . .” [Art. 91, RPC.] In the instant case, the public document
allegedly falsified was a notarized deed of sale registered on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1961</st1:date> with the Register of
Deeds in the name of the accused, private respondent herein, <span class="SpellE">Mizpah</span> R. Reyes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
two <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for falsification of a public
document subject matter of the controversy were, however, filed only on <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainants claim that they discovered
the falsified notarized deed of sale in June 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court is tasked with determining whether
the crime has prescribed which hinges on whether or not its discovery may be
deemed to have taken place from the time the document was registered with the
Register of Deeds, consistent with the rule on constructive notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses Julio <span class="SpellE">Rizare</span> and Patricia <span class="SpellE">Pampo</span> owned a parcel of land located in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lipa</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
registered in their names under TCT No. T-7471.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

children:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the accused <span class="SpellE">Mizpah</span> R.

<p class="BODY">In June 1983, the complainants allegedly discovered from the
records of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> City that
the abovementioned property had already been transferred in the name of "<span class="SpellE">Mizpah</span> Reyes, single, of legal age, Filipino and resident

<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>"
under TCT No. T-9885.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They further
allegedly discovered that the conveyance was effected through a notarized deed
of sale executed and signed on <st1:date year="1961" day="19" month="5">May 19,
 1961</st1:date> by their parents Julio <span class="SpellE">Rizare</span> and
Patricia <span class="SpellE">Pampo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The deed of sale was registered with the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> City on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="5">May
 26, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon examination
of the document, they found that the signature of their parents were allegedly
falsified and that accused also made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an
</span>untruthful statement that she was single although she was married to one
Benjamin Reyes on <st1:date year="1950" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The document was referred by the complainants
to the National Bureau of Investigation (N.B.I.) for examination of the
signatures of their parents and a report was returned with the finding that the
signature of Julio <span class="SpellE">Rizare</span> was genuine but that of
Patricia <span class="SpellE">Pampo</span> was forged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon complaint by the sisters of the accused
and after conducting an investigation, the fiscal filed with the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, Branch XIII, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lipa</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1984</st1:date> two
(2) <span class="SpellE">informations</span> both for falsification of public
document, the first in Criminal Case No. V-1163, for allegedly making it appear
in the notarized deed of sale that Patricia <span class="SpellE">Pampo</span>,
the mother of the accused, participated in the sale of a parcel of land by
falsifying <span class="SpellE">Pampo's</span> signature, and the second in
Criminal Case No. V-1164, for allegedly making an untruthful statement of fact
in the deed of sale, more specifically, by stating that accused was single.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before arraignment, accused filed a motion to quash both <span class="SpellE">informations</span> on grounds that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) "The criminal action or liability
has been extinguished by prescription of the crime in the light of Cabral v. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, 70 SCRA 606"; and (2) "The trial court had
no jurisdiction over the offense charged and the person of accused because of
non-compliance with the pre-conciliation requirement of P.D. No. 1508." [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 33.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court granted the motion and quashed the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> in the two (2) cases stating that:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>The essence, therefore, of registration is to serve notice to the
whole world of the legal status and the dealing therewith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If registration is a notice to the whole world, then registration
is in itself a notice and therefore, the prescriptive period of registered
document must start to run from the date the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

<blockquote>In these two cases in question, prescriptive period of ten (10)
years should have started from <st1:date year="1960" day="26" month="5">May 26,
 1960</st1:date> (sic).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the
lapse of more than twenty (20) years before <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>two <span class="SpellE">informations</span> were filed, the
crimes for which the accused, <span class="SpellE">Mizpah</span> Reyes, are
charged have already prescribed.</blockquote>

are quashed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">From the trial court's order quashing the two (2) <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, the People, petitioner herein, filed an
appeal with the Court of Appeals (then designated as the Intermediate Appellate
Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a>
promulgated on <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1986</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals rejected the theory of
petitioner that the prescriptive period should commence on June 1983, when the
complainants actually discovered the fraudulent deed of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court sustained the trial
court's ruling that the prescriptive period started on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1961</st1:date>, when the deed of sale was
registered with the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span>
City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition for review on
<i>certiorari</i> of the decision of the Court of Appeals, filed by the People,
through the Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the authorities relied upon by the Court of Appeals in
dismissing petitioner’s appeal is the case of <u>Cabral</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Puno</u></span>, G.R. No. L-41692, April 30, 1976, 70 SCRA 606,
where the Supreme Court made a statement to the effect that in the crime of
falsification of a public document, the prescriptive period commences from the
time the offended party had constructive notice of the alleged forgery after
the document was registered with the Register of Deeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, petitioner contends <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that this </span>particular statement is not
doctrine but merely an <u>obiter</u> <u>dictum</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>Cabral</u> case stemmed from the filing on <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1974</st1:date> of an information
accusing <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Cabral of the crime of falsification
of public document for allegedly falsifying on <st1:date year="1948" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1948</st1:date> the signature of the complainant <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> San Andres in a deed of sale of a parcel of
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before arraignment, petitioner
moved to quash the information on the ground of prescription of the crime, as
the notarized deed of sale was registered with the Register of Deeds on <st1:date year="1948" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After hearing the motion, the judge issued a
resolution granting the motion to quash and dismissing the information on the
ground of prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
prosecutor filed a motion for the reconsideration of the resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting on said motion, the trial court
ordered the fiscal to make known his position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fiscal filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>comment
stating that the crime has not prescribed as the complainant <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Diego</st1:place></st1:city> claimed that he only discovered the crime in
October 1970.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the trial
court set aside its resolution granting the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
motion to quash and reinstated the information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused brought the case to the Supreme Court questioning the trial
court's authority to set aside its resolution granting his motion to
quash.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court ruled in favor
of the accused by holding that the aforementioned resolution has already become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for failure of the fiscal to file
a motion for reconsideration within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration
filed by the private prosecutor was disregarded because of the latter's lack of
legal standing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another reason given by
the Court for its decision is the following:</p>

<blockquote>. . . The Rules of Court is explicit that
an order sustaining a motion to quash based on prescription is a bar to another
prosecution for the same offense [<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 2 (f) and 8,

89 of the Revised Penal Code also provides that "prescription of the
crime" is one of the grounds for "total extinction of criminal
liability." Petitioner was charged with the crime of falsification under

carries an imposable penalty of <span class="SpellE"><b><u>prision</u></b></span>

because the rule on constructive notice is limited in application to land
registration cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that
haste should be avoided in applying civil law presumptions to criminal suits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although caution should be observed in applying the rules of
construction in civil cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the
interpretation of criminal statutes, the Court will not hesitate to do so if
the factual and legal circumstances so warrant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mercado</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><u>v.</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Santos,</span></u> 66 Phil. 215 (1938), the Court app<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">l</span>ied the presumption arising from the
allowance of w<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ill </span>to bar a
criminal action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that particular
case, the petitioner filed a petition for the probate of the will of his
deceased wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The will was duly
probated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sixteen (16) months
thereafter, a criminal complaint <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>filed against petitioner for
falsification or forgery of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss
the case claiming that the order probation the will is conclusive as to its
authenticity and due execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
motion having been denied, the petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with the Court of Appeals (CA) which ruled that "the judgment admitting
the will to probate is binding upon the whole world as to the due execution and
genuineness of the will insofar as civil rights and liabilities are concerned,
but not for the purpose of punishment of a crime." But the Supreme Court
reversed the CA decision by ruling that, in accordance with Sec. 625 of the
then Code of Civil Procedure which provides that "the allowance by the
court of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">will </span>of real and
personal estate shall be conclusive as to its due execution,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">**</span></span></a> a
criminal action will not lie in this jurisdiction against the forger of a will
which had been duly admitted to probate by a court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, however, insisted in this case that the rule on
constructive notice applies only in civil cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that the law on prescription of
crimes is founded on a principle different from that of the law on prescription
in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">civil </span>actions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The difference it is claimed, precludes the
application of the rule on constructive notice in criminal actions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">statute </span>of
limitations of civil actions was explained in <span class="SpellE"><u>Penales</u></span>
<u>v.</u> <u>Intermediate</u> <u>Appellate</u> <u>Court</u>, G.R. No. 73611,
October 27, 1986, 145 SCRA 223, 228 in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>Prescription <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>rightly
regarded as a statute of repose whose object is to suppress fraudulent and
stale claims from springing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">up at great
distances of time and surprising the parties or their representatives when the
facts have become obscure from the lapse of time or death or removal of witness
.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Court in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Moran</u>,
44 Phil. 389, 405-406 (1923) discussed the nature of the statute of limitations
in criminal cases as follows:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">. .
. </span>The statute is not a statute of process, to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">scantily </span>and grudgingly applied, but an amnesty, declaring that
after a certain time oblivion shall be cast over the offence:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the offender shall be at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">liberty to return to his country, and resume
his immunities as a citizen; and that from henceforth he may cease to preserve
the proofs of his innocence, for the proofs of his guilt are blotted out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence it is that statutes of limitation are
to be liberally construed in favor of the defendant, not only because such
liberality of construction belongs to all acts of amnesty and grace, but
because the very existence of the statute is a recognition and notification by
the legislature of the fact that time, while it gradually wears out proofs of
innocence, has assigned to it fixed and positive periods in </span>which it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">destroys proofs </span>of guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Independently of these views, it must be
remembered that delay in instituting prosecutions is not only productive of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">expense to the State, but of peril to public
justice in the attenuation and distortion, even by mere natural lapse of
memory, of testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the policy
of the law that prosecutions should be prompt, and that statutes enforcing such
promptitude should be vigorously maintained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are not merely acts of grace, but checks imposed by the State upon
itself, to exact vigilant activity </span>from its subalterns, and to secure
for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">criminal trials the best evidence
that can be obtained.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is evident that there is merit in petitioner's claim that the
law on prescription of civil suits is founded on different policy
considerations from that of the law on prescription of criminal actions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the Court does not subscribe to the
conclusion that the presumptions and rules of interpretation used in the law on
prescription of civil suits, including the rule on constructive notice, can not
be applied in criminal actions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The considerations in providing for prescription of civil suits
are based mainly on practical and equitable grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lapse of a considerably long period of
time obscures the surrounding circumstances of a particular claim or right and
erodes the integrity of whatever evidence may be presented in support of an
action to enforce or contest such claim or right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, where a particular right has
accrued in favor of a party, the enjoyment of such right cannot forever be left
on a precarious balance, always susceptible to possible <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">challenge by an adverse party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After a certain period of time fixed by law, the right enjoyed by a
party must be accorded respect by prohibiting adverse claims the factual basis
of which can no longer be verified </span>with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">certainty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the law on
prescription of civil suits is properly called a statute of repose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The practical factor of securing for civil suits the best
evidence that can be obtained is also a major consideration in criminal
trials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the law on prescription
of crimes rests on a more fundamental principle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being more than a statute of repose, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>an act
of grace whereby the state, after the lapse of a certain period of time,
surrenders <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">its
</span>sovereign power to prosecute the criminal act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the law on prescription of civil suits
is interposed by the legislature as an impartial arbiter between two contending
parties, the law on prescription of crimes is an act of amnesty and liberality
on the part of the state in favor of the offender [People v. Moran, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">, </span>at p. 405.] Hence, in the interpretation of the law on
prescription of crimes, that which is most favorable to the accused is to be
adopted [People v. Moran, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">; </span>People v. Parcel, 44 Phil. 437
(1923); People v. Yu <span class="SpellE">Hai</span>, 99 Phil. 725 (1956).] The
application of the rule on constructive notice in the construction of Art. 91
of the Revised Penal Code would most certainly be favorable to the accused
since the prescriptive period of the crime shall have to be reckoned with
earlier, i.e., from the time the notarized deed of sale was recorded in the
Registry of Deeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case,
the notarized deed of sale was registered on <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
criminal <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for falsification of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>public
document having been filed only on <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="10">October
 18, 1984</st1:date>, or more than ten (10) years from <st1:date year="1961" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1961</st1:date>, the crime for which the accused was
charged has prescribed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of
Appeals, therefore, committed no reversible error in affirming the trial
court's order quashing the two <span class="SpellE">informations</span> on the
ground of prescription.</p>
