				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Having met with no success in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and in the Court of Appeals, the petitioners are now
in this Court in a third and final attempt to recover from the Philippine
Airlines, Inc. (hereafter, simply PAL) the value of jewelry, other valuables
and money taken from them by four (4) armed robbers on board one of the
latter's airplanes while on a flight from <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> City
to Manila, as well as moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees and expenses
of litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners accept the correctness of the basic facts adopted
by the Court of Appeals from the judgment of the Court of First Instance, to
wit:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>1. " ** Norberto <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>, Sr. and
<span class="SpellE">Gunther</span> <span class="SpellE">Loeffler</span> were among
the passengers of ** (<span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>) Fokker 'Friendship'
PIC-536 plane in its flight of <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="11">November
 6, 1968</st1:date> which left <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mactan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30</st1:time> in the evening with <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for its destination."</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. "After the plane had taken off, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
O. <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>, a Senior NBI Agent who was also a
passenger of the said plane, noticed a certain '<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>,'
a suspect in the killing of Judge Valdez, seated at the front seat near the
door leading to the cockpit of the plane.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A check by <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> with the passengers'
ticket in the possession of flight Stewardess Annie <span class="SpellE">Bontigao</span>,
who was seated at the last seat right row, revealed that '<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>'
had used the name '<span class="SpellE">Cardente</span>,' one of his aliases
known to <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>. <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>
also came to know from the stewardess that '<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>'
had three companions on board the plane."</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. "<span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> then scribbled a note
addressed to the pilot of the plane requesting the latter to contact NBI duty
agents in Manila for the said agents to ask the Director of the NBI to send
about six NBI agents to meet the plane because the suspect in the killing of
Judge Valdez was on board (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'G').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said note was handed by <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> to the stewardess who in turn gave the same to the
pilot."</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. "After receiving the note, which was about 15 minutes after
take off, the pilot of the plane, Capt. Luis <span class="SpellE">Bonnevie</span>,
Jr., came out of the cockpit and sat beside <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>
at the rear portion of the plane and explained that he could not send the
message because it would be heard by all ground aircraft stations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>, however,
told the pilot of the danger of commission of violent acts on board the plane
by the notorious<span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>'<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>' and
his three companions."</blockquote>

<blockquote>5. "While the pilot and <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>
were talking, '<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>' and one of his companions
walked to the rear and stood behind them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Capt. <span class="SpellE">Bonnevie</span> then stood up and went back to
the cockpit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>'
and his companions returned to their seats, but after a few minutes they moved
back to the rear throwing ugly looks at <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> who,
sensing danger, stood up and went back to his original seat across the aisle on
the second to the last seat near the window.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>' and his companion likewise went back
to their respective seats in front."</blockquote>

<blockquote>6. "Soon thereafter an exchange of gunshots ensued between <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> and '<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>' and the
latter's companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>' announced to the passengers and the pilots in the
cockpit that it was a hold-up and ordered the pilot not to send any SOS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hold-uppers divested the passengers of
their belongings."</blockquote>

<blockquote>7. "Specifically, ** Norberto <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>,
Sr. was divested of jewelries and cash in the total amount of P18,650.00 out of
which recoveries were made amounting to P4,550.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>** <span class="SpellE">Gunther</span> <span class="SpellE">Loeffler</span> was divested of a wrist watch, cash and a wallet
in the total amount of P1,700.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result of the incident ** <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>, Sr. suffered
shock, because a gun had been pointed at him by one of the hold?
uppers."</blockquote>

<blockquote>8. "Upon landing at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>International</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Airport</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
'<span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span>' and his three companions succeeded in
escaping."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Demands were thereafter made on PAL by <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Loeffler</span> "to indemnify ** (them) on their
aforesaid loss, but ** (PAL) refused ** (averring that) it is not liable to
(them) in law or in fact."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Contending that the "aforesaid loss is a result of breach of
** (<span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>) contractual obligation to carry ** (them)
and their belongings and effects to their Manila destination without loss or
damage, and constitutes a serious dereliction of ** (<span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>)
legal duty to exercise extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over the
same," <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span> and <span class="SpellE">Loeffler</span>
brought suit against PAL in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
as stated in this opinion's opening paragraph, to recover the value of the
property lost by them to the robbers as well as moral and exemplary damages,
attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The plaintiffs declared that their suit was instituted " ** pursuant to
Civil Code articles 1754, 1998, 2000 and 2001 and on the ground that in
relation to said Civil Code article 2001 the complained-of act of the armed
robbers is not a <i style=""><span style="">force</span></i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">majeure</span></i></span><span style="">, </span>as the <span style="">'use </span>of arms' or 'irresistible force'
was not taken advantage of by said armed robbers in gaining entrance to
defendant's ill-fated plane in questions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, with respect to said Civil Code article 1998, it is not essential
that the lost effects and belongings of plaintiffs were actually delivered to
defendant's plane personnel or that the latter were notified thereof (De <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> v. <span style="">Tam </span><span class="SpellE">Khey</span>,
[CA] 58 O.G. 7693)."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">PAL filed answer denying liability, alleging <i style=""><span style="">inter</span></i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">alia</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>that the robbery during the flight and
after the aircraft was forcibly landed at the Manila Airport did indeed
constitute <i style=""><span style="">force</span></i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">majeure</span></i></span><span style="">, </span>and
neither of the plaintiffs had notified PAL "or its crew or employees that
they were in possession of cash, German marks and valuable jewelries and
watches" or surrendered said items to "the crew or personnel on board
the aircraft."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Court of First Instance rendered judgment
"dismissing plaintiffs' complaint with costs against ** (them)."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court opined that since the plaintiffs "did not notify defendant or
its employees that they were in possession of the cash, jewelries, and the
wallet they are now claiming," the very provision of law invoked by them,
Article 1998 of the Civil Code, denies them any recourse against PAL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court also pointed out that -</p>

<blockquote>" ** while it is true that the use of
arms was not taken advantage of by the robbers in gaining entrance to
defendant's ill-fated plane, the armed robbery that took place constitutes <i style="">force</i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">majeure</i></span><span style=""> </span>for which defendant is not liable
because the robbers were able to gain entrance to the plane with the guns they
used already in their possession, which fact could not have been prevented nor
avoided by the defendant since it was not authorized to search its passengers
for firearms and deadly weapons as shown in Exhibits '6,' '7,' '8,' and '8-A.'
As its robbery constitutes <i style="">force</i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">majeure</i></span><span style="">, </span>defendant is not liable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
That Court affirmed the trial court's judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It rejected the argument that "the use or arms or ** irresistible
force" referred to in Article 2001 constitutes <i style="">force</i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">majeure</i></span><span style=""> </span>only if resorted to <span class="SpellE">to</span> gain entry into the airplane, and not if it attends
"the robbery itself." The Court ruled that under the facts, "the
<span class="SpellE">highjacking</span>-robbery was force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>,"
observing that -</p>

<blockquote>" ** hijackers do not board an
airplane through a blatant display of firepower and violent fury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firearms, hand-grenades, dynamite, and
explosives are introduced into the airplane surreptitiously and with the utmost
cunning and stealth, although there is an occasional use of innocent hostages
who will be coldly murdered unless a plane is given to the hijackers' complete
disposal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objective of modern-day
hijackers is to display the irresistible force amounting to force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> only when it is most effective and that is when the
jetliner is winging its way at Himalayan altitudes and ill-advised heroics by
either crew or passengers would send the multi-million peso airplane and the
priceless lives of all its occupants into certain death and destruction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* *</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court also ruled that in light of the evidence PAL
could not be faulted for want of diligence, particularly for failing "to
take positive measures to implement Civil Aeronautics Administration
regulations prohibiting civilians from carrying firearms on board
aircrafts;" and that "the absence of coded transmissions, the
amateurish <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of the pilot in dealing with the
NBI agent, the allegedly open cockpit door, and the failure to return to <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span>, in the light of the circumstances of the case * *,
were not negligent acts sufficient to overcome the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>
nature of the armed robbery." In fact, the Court went on to say,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>" ** it is illusive to assume that had
these precautions been taken, the hijacking or the robbery would not have
succeeded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mandatory use of the most
sophisticated electronic detection devices and magnetometers, the imposition of
severe penalties, the development of screening procedures, the compilation of
hijacker <span class="SpellE">behavioural</span> profiles, the assignment of sky
marshals, and the weight of outraged world opinion may have minimized
hijackings but all these have proved ineffective against truly determined
hijackers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>World experience shows that
if a group of armed hijackers want to take over a plane in flight, they can
elude the latest combined government and airline industry measures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as our own experience in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
illustrates, the use of force to overcome hijackers, results in the death and
injury of innocent passengers and crew members.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not in the least bit suggesting that the Philippine Airlines
should not do everything humanly possible to protect passengers from hijackers'
acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We merely state that where the
defendant has faithfully complied with the requirements of government agencies
and adhered to the established procedures and precautions of the airline
industry at any particular time, its failure to take certain steps that a
passenger in hindsight believes should have been taken is not the negligence or
misconduct which mingles with force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> as an
active and cooperative cause.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the circumstances of the instant case, the acts of the
airline and its crew cannot be faulted as negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hijackers had already shown their
willingness to kill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One passenger was
in fact killed and another survived gunshot wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lives of the rest of the passengers and
crew were more important than their properties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cooperation with the hijackers until they released their hostages at the
runway end near the South Superhighway was dictated by the circumstances."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Insisting that the evidence demonstrates negligence on the part
of the PAL crew "occurring before and exposing them to hijacking," <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span> and <span class="SpellE">Loeffler</span> have come
up to this Court praying that the judgments of the trial Court and the Court of
Appeals be reversed and another rendered in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again, the issue will be resolved
against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful analysis of the record in relation to the memoranda and
other pleadings of the parties, convinces this Court of the correctness of the
essential conclusion of both the trial and appellate courts that the evidence
does indeed fail to prove any want of diligence on the part of PAL, or that,
more specifically, it had failed to comply with applicable regulations or
universally accepted and observed procedures to preclude hijacking; and that the
particular acts singled out by the petitioners as supposedly demonstrative of
negligence were, in the light of the circumstances of the case, not in truth
negligent acts "sufficient to overcome the force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>
nature of the armed robbery." The Court quite agrees, too, with the
Appellate Tribunal's wry observation that <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span>
"failure to take certain steps that a passenger in hindsight believes
should have been taken is not the negligence or misconduct which mingles with
force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span> as an active and cooperative
cause."</p>

<p class="BODY">No success can therefore attend petitioners' appeal, not only
because they wish to have a review and modification of factual conclusions of
the Court of Appeals, which established and uniformly observed axiom
proscribes,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
but also because those factual conclusions have in this Court's view been
correctly drawn from the proofs on record.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED and the appealed
Decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED, with costs against petitioners.</p>
