hence, it would be in keeping with substantial justice if a <i>status quo</i> of things be maintained.&nbsp; He also asks that the urgent petition be resolved and that meanwhile the directive to turn over the keys be held in abeyance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On 23 March 1988 Teotico formally charged Agda for insubordination and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service for, among others, his failure to comply with the memorandum of January 7, 1988 and with the routing slip request of 11 March 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On 4 April 1988 Teotico placed Agda under preventive suspension pursuant to his Special Order No. 74, to wit:<br><blockquote>"Pursuant to Section (sic) 41 and 42 of P.D. 807, Mr. Democrito Agda, Sr. is placed under preventive suspension for the following reasons:<br><blockquote>"a)&nbsp;

Lanuza, Jr. as officer-in-charge (OIC) of FIDA Region 1; that on December 15, 1987, petitioner requested the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to stay the implementation of Special Order No. 219; that on January 7, 1988, respondent Teotico implemented said Special Order 219, despite the fact that petitioner requested the Civil Service Commission to stay implementation of the said Special Order 219; that on January 12, 1988, petitioner requested the respondent Teotico to defer the implementation of said Special Order No. 219; that on March 2, 1988, respondent Teotico again implemented Special Order 219, requiring petitioner to submit his accomplishment report; that on March 9, 1988, petitioner requested respondent Teotico to defer the implementation of said special order, considering that the same has not yet been resolved by the Secretary of Agriculture; that on December 11, 1987, former FIDA Administrator designated Wilfredo G.

Horacio SJ Apostol, Manager of the Law Department of the Commission, to the effect that the records of the Department do not show, as of that date, that the Special Order was submitted or referred to the Commission.&nbsp; The latter is not conclusive proof that no prior authority was in fact obtained by Administrator Lanuza for the reassignment or detail of Agda.&nbsp; No law requires the submission to the COMELEC of special orders reassigning or detailing employees within the prohibited period.&nbsp; What is needed is "prior authority," the request for which and its approval may be in separate documents or papers.<br><br>Moreover, although Agda alleges in his amended petition that:<br><blockquote>"11.20.&nbsp; Petitioner is <i>filing</i> criminal charges for violations of Secs. 3, 261(h) and 264 of B.P. 881 against former FIDA Administrator Lanuza and respondent Teotico in the COMELEC." (Italics supplied).</blockquote>none of his subsequent pleadings both before the lower court and before Us disclose that he had in fact filed such charges.&nbsp; Obviously, said allegation was a clever attempt to show a semblance of a valid grievance.<br><br>Furthermore, even in the cases of transfer or detail within the prohibited period prior to an election, an aggrieved party is provided an appropriate administrative remedy.&nbsp; Section 6 of Rule VI of the Civil Service Rules on Personnel Actions and Policies provides:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 6. Except when the exigencies of the service require, an official or employee of the government may not be ordered detailed or reassigned during the three-month period before any local or national election, and if he believes that the order for his detail or reassignment is due to harassment, coercion, intimidation, or other personal reasons, he may appeal the order to the Commission.&nbsp; Until this is proven, however, the order is presumed to be in the interest of the service and notwithstanding the appeal, the decision to detail or reassign him shall be executory, but the Commission may order deferment or suspension of the detail or reassignment <i>ex parte</i>."</blockquote>Agda made no attempt to avail of this remedy.&nbsp; In his Urgent Petition To Stay Implementation and Nullify Special Order No. 219, nothing is mentioned about a violation of the ban on transfer or detail.&nbsp; The reason seems too obvious.&nbsp; Until he filed the Amended Petition before the court below he did not consider his re-assignment per Special Order No. 219 as a violation of the ban on transfer or detail during the three-month period before the election.<br><br>Not having yet fully exhausted the existing adequate administrative remedy which he already took advantage of, Agda cannot be permitted to abandon it at his chosen time and leisure and invoke the jurisdiction of regular courts.&nbsp; As aptly summarized:<br><blockquote>"Within the administrative forum the law may provide for review of decisions by higher authorities.&nbsp; Before a party can be allowed to invoke the jurisdiction of the courts of justice, he is expected to have exhausted all means of administrative redress afforded him.&nbsp; There are both legal and practical reasons for this.&nbsp; The administrative process is intended to provide less expensive and more speedy solutions to disputes.&nbsp; Where the enabling statute indicates a procedure for administrative review, and provides a system of administrative appeal, or reconsideration, the courts for reasons of law, comity and convenience, will not entertain a case unless the available administrative remedies have been resorted to and the appropriate authorities have been given opportunity to act and correct the errors committed in the administrative forum."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></blockquote>The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is well-entrenched in this jurisdiction and a host of cases has buttressed its stability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup> There are, of course, recognized exceptions thereto, but, unfortunately, private respondent cannot seek safe refuge under their protective mantle, for in respect to the remedy provided for in Section 24(c) of P.D. No. 807, which is also the remedy provided for in Section 24(f), availment thereof is indispensable for the viability of any judicial action.&nbsp; As We held in <i>Department of Education, Culture and Sports, et al. vs. The Honorable Court of Appeals, et al., supra.</i>:<br><blockquote>"Finally, respondent Navarro has not exhausted administrative remedies as she did not elevate the matter of her transfer to the Civil Service Commission in accordance with Section 24(c), P.D. No. 807, otherwise known as the Civil Service Decree, which provides:<br><br>. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . . .<br><br>By not appealing her case to the Civil Service Commission before filing Special Civil Action No. Q-37025, respondent Navarro is indubitably without cause of action."</blockquote>Respondent Judge, as clearly shown in his Order of 11 May 1988, was fully aware of Agda's urgent petition before the Civil Service Commission to suspend its implementation of Special Order No. 219 and to nullify the same.&nbsp; He had, therefore, no other business to do except to grant the motion to dismiss.&nbsp; He should have, forthwith, stayed his hands until the administrative processes had been completed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> Yet, for reasons only known to him, which We cannot divine at, he did not do so.&nbsp; On the contrary, he granted the application for a writ of preliminary injunction and issued the writ on 17 May 1988.<br><br>The writ was improvidently and capriciously issued.&nbsp; The issuance of the writ, although addressed to the sound discretion of the court, is conditioned on the existence of a clear and positive right which should be protected.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Considering that the amended petition should have been dismissed outright because Agda prematurely invoked the jurisdiction of the court in view of his appeal to the Civil Service Commission, it follows that, even if he had a right, no protection was available from the court below.&nbsp; But even if We disregard for the moment the above weakness of the amended petition and consider, as the respondent Judge did, "the pleadings and their annexes," the inescapable action that should follow would be denial of the application for the issuance of the writ.&nbsp; The pleadings and the annexes do not at all demonstrate a clear and positive right for Agda, for as discussed above, by the very nature of his appointment he had no security of tenure in the station to where he was assigned on 2 January 1984; besides, his <i>designation</i> as <i>acting</i> Regional Administrator for FIDA Regions I and II was terminable at any time at the pleasure of the head of office.&nbsp; Moreover, as could be gleaned from the annexes of the Amended Petition, Agda impliedly accepted his re-assignment to the Control Office of FIDA.&nbsp; To Teotico's Memorandum of January 1988 addressed to Agda as "Regional Administrator" which required him to submit his development programs for Region I (1988-1993) and his proposals for sericulture and the maguey industry in said Region, Agda, in his indorsement of 12 January 1988 claims and admits that "this representation was reassigned to FIDA Central Office where he now reports up to the present" and that "Mr. Wilfredo Seguritan . . . remains up to the present as the OIC of FIDA for the said Region." In this indorsement Agda wrote below his signature the following: (Detailed to Central Office).&nbsp; To Teotico's Memorandum of 2 March 1988 requiring him to submit an official clarification on his whereabouts and his accomplishments for the past three weeks since he had not been seen or officially heard from, Agda referred the former to the record (log book) kept by the FIDA Guard and certificates of appearance.&nbsp; Clearly then, as of the filing of the Amended Petition, Special Order No. 219 was a <i>fait accompli</i>.&nbsp; Acts already consummated cannot be enjoined by preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>The respondent Judge did not stop there.&nbsp; As complained by Teotico, on 16 December 1988 the former issued an Order wherein although he denied the motion for the reconsideration of his 8 September 1988 Order denying the motion for contempt, he ordered Teotico to immediately reinstate Agda "from (sic) his previous position as Fiber Regional Administrator, FIDA Region I, with full back wages and allowances mandated by law." This, in effect, amounted to a mandatory injunction, issued without a hearing and in violation of Section 5 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.&nbsp; There was no basis for its issuance.&nbsp; A mandatory injunction may only be issued upon a showing that the invasion of the right is material and substantial; the right of complainant is clear and unmistakable; and there is an urgent and permanent necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> They have not been shown to exist in this case.<br><br>Even if the 16 December reinstatement order should be construed to be directed against the preventive suspension order issued by Teotico on 4 April 1988, respondent Judge clearly capriciously breached the limits of his discretion for nowhere in his amended petition has Agda attacked its validity or legality on any other ground than its being issued to <i>implement</i> Special Order No. 219,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> which he claims was issued in violation of the pertinent provisions of the Omnibus Election Code and the Civil Service Decree prohibiting transfer or reassignment of civil service officials and employees within three months before the local election of January 18, 1988.&nbsp; He assailed the suspension order not on the ground that Teotico does not have the authority to file the formal charge and to preventively suspend him, but solely on the basis of his self-serving claim that both were issued without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion because they were meant to implement Special Order No. 219.<br><br>Preventive suspension is allowed under Section 41 of P.D. No. 807 which reads:<br><blockquote>"SECTION 41. <i>Preventive Suspension.</i> - The proper disciplining authority may preventively suspend any subordinate officer or employee under his authority pending an investigation, if the charge against such officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct, or neglect in the performance of duty, or if there are reasons to believe that the respondent is guilty of charges which would warrant his removal from the service."</blockquote>However, per Section 42 of the same decree, if the administrative cases against the suspended officer or employee, who is not a Presidential appointee, is not finally decided by the disciplining authority within ninety days after date of suspension, he shall be automatically reinstated in the service provided that when the delay in the disposition of the case is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the respondent, the period of delay shall not be counted in computing the period of suspension.<br><br>In the instant case, by Agda's own act and the cooperation of respondent Judge, the administrative case against the former is not yet even ready for hearing.&nbsp; He has not filed his Answer, although he was given until 21 April 1988 within which to do so.<br><br>Lastly, We hold that both the preliminary injunction and the reinstatement order issued by respondent Judge practically granted the main relief prayed for by Agda even before the hearing on the case on the merits.&nbsp; In <i>Obias, et al. vs. Hon. Borja, et al.</i>, 136 SCRA 687, We ruled that respondent judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in issuing a writ of preliminary injunction which in effect practically granted the principal relief sought in the Mandamus case.&nbsp; The reason for this is that such issuance "would, in effect, be a prejudgment of the main case and a reversal of the rule on the burden of proof since it would assume the proposition which the petitioner is inceptively bound to prove."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The foregoing conclusions render unnecessary a discussion on other matters raised in this case.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the Petition is GRANTED.&nbsp; The Orders of respondent Judge of 11 May 1988, 16 December 1988, 29 December 1988 and 14 February 1989 and the Writ of Injunction issued on 17 May 1987 in Civil Case No. 88-577 entitled Democrito D.
