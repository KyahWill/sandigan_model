school premises must be a cause for alarm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the apprehension of those actively trafficking in these instruments
of destruction should be relentlessly pursued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The case now before this court is one of such apprehensions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It deserves prior attention.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about four o'clock in the afternoon of August 9, 1982, Ephraim
<span class="SpellE">Englis</span>, an applicant for the Integrated National
Police, upon instruction of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> Martinez,
team leader of the Special Operation Group of the PHQ, conducted a surveillance
at the Ramon <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Memorial Colleges in General
Santos City due to reports of use of marijuana by many students.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He talked to some students and pretended to
be a buyer of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the
students pointed to William Domingo as one of those pushing marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He approached Domingo and asked if he had
stocks with him for sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Domingo
replied that the price was P20.00 per box or P<span style="">30.00 </span>if he will buy two boxes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Englis</span> agreed to buy two boxes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he had no stock with him then, Domingo
told <span class="SpellE">Englis</span> to meet him at the corner of Recto-Laurel
Streets, <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18"><span style="">six
 </span>o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of that day with the money.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <span style="">six </span><span class="SpellE">oclock</span> in the evening at the agreed
place, a tricycle marked <span style="">as </span>"<span class="SpellE">Pelotin</span> Family" arrived
with Domingo as passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stopped in
front of <span class="SpellE">Englis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Domingo gave two matchboxes of dried marijuana leaves to <span class="SpellE">Englis</span> who thereafter gave him P30.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Domingo left immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Englis</span> gave a
signal to Sgt. Martinez and his companions, who were posted about twenty meters
away at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Claro</span> M. Recto St.</st1:street>
 <st1:city>Martinez</st1:city></st1:address> started their jeep and picked up <span class="SpellE">Englis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
they chased the tricycle which proceeded towards the plaza.</p>

<p class="BODY">They overtook the tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city> asked the driver,
John <span class="SpellE">Pelotin</span>, where his companion was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pelotin</span> pointed to
Domingo who was five to ten meters away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Englis</span> approached Domingo whom he identified
as the person who handed him the two matchboxes of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They brought <span class="SpellE">Pelotin</span>
and Domingo to the PC Barracks for investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the custodial interrogation, after having been appraised
of their constitutional rights, <span class="SpellE">Pelotin</span> and <span style="">Domingo executed </span>extrajudicial confession<span style="">s.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Domingo <span style="">admitted that the marijuana
which he gave <span class="SpellE">Englis</span> came from a certain person from <span class="SpellE">Bansalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, to be disposed of </span>in <span style="">General </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise stated that
he encouraged his friends Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Pelotin</span>, Ronald

to smoke marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Martinez showed
Domingo the two matchboxes full of dried marijuana leaves which the latter gave

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>appeal is
devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assigned error <span style="">appellant Domingo </span>contends that the records show that two
matchboxes containing marijuana leaves were taken by Sgt. <span style="">Martinez </span>from Ephraim <span class="SpellE">Englis</span> inside the P.<span style="">C.
</span>Headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Dadiangas</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on the night of <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1982</st1:date>
and not <span style="">from </span>the appellant
Domingo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the records in fact show
is that it was the appellant <span style="">who </span>delivered
the two matchboxes to <span class="SpellE">Englis</span> <span style="">in </span>consideration of which he was duly paid by <span class="SpellE">Englis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contraband was turned over by <span class="SpellE">Englis</span> to <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the receipt issued to appellant Domingo
by <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city> for said matchboxes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the second and third assigned errors, appellant Domingo
argues that there is no showing that the match boxes that were submitted for
examination at the P.C. laboratory are the very same ones taken from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a receipt was issued to the appellant by Sgt. Martinez for
the two matchboxes of marijuana, the same were placed in a cellophane bag
properly marked with the name of William Domingo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="8">August
 9, 1982</st1:date>, it was indorsed by Lt. Col. <span class="SpellE">Warieto</span>
A. Capitan, PC (GSC), Provincial Commander of <st1:place>South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place> and <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to the PC laboratory in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> for examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It was received by the duty detail man in the PC laboratory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span>
conducted three examinations - physical, chemical and TLC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examinations showed that the leaves were
positive <span style="">for </span>marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the circumstances, it appears that
safeguards were adopted to ensure that the two matchboxes with contents taken
from appellant Domingo were the same ones turned over to the PC laboratory for
examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Domingo capitalizes on the fact that while in the
information it is alleged that he was caught in possession of "shredded
dried marijuana leaves" in the Chemistry Report No. D-082-82 of Lt. <span class="SpellE">Sabio</span> she described what was submitted for examination
"crushed dried leaves" of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said descriptions mean one and the same thing, and as the Solicitor
General correctly pointed out, the denomination is just a play of words.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both appellants contend that the confession of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and Ronald Gregorio
are only admissible against them (<span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and
Gregorio) and not against their co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The argument is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> <span style="">and </span>Gregorio
testified in court so that certainly their statements are direct evidence <span style="">against </span>the appellants where the latter
were given the opportunity to cross-examine the said witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants then point out that there is no proof of the <u>corpus</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is there any <span style="">better </span>proof
than the admission of appellants that they smoked <span style="">marijuana </span>leaves?<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed Ronald Gregorio categorically testified that after appellants smoked
marijuana they felt warm <span style="">and </span>weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This disposes of the other assigned errors.</p>
