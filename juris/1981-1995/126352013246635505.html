<p class="BODY">The People's version of the facts is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Isidro <span class="SpellE">Ebrano</span> and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Ebrano</span> were houseboys of the late Chua Chin alias Julian
who had a store at Barrio San Rafael, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cateel</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Province</span></st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental</st1:placename></st1:place>. In the eve­ning
of <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1971</st1:date>, they
were sleeping at the mezzanine floor of the said store. At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that
same evening, Isidro <span class="SpellE">Ebrano</span> was awakened by
commotions he <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">heard </span>from
downstairs. He went down one step of the stairs and looked towards the bedroom
of his employer through the holes of the partition which separated the bodega
and the stairs leading to the mezzanine floor. He saw Chua Chin, <span class="SpellE">Yolando</span> Alba and another one whom he did not know. Alba was
pushing Chua inside the bedroom. He saw this because of the flashlight held by
the other person that was focused on the ceiling (pp. 129-138, 139, 155­-159,
167-170, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">July 18, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">). Afraid of what he witnessed, Isidro went
back to bed without telling his </span>companion Ramon <span class="SpellE">Ebrano</span>
(pp. 138-140, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the early morning of <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="12">December 8,
 1971</st1:date>, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">delos</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
storekeeper and in-charge of the books of account in the store of Chua Chin
alias Julian, was going to buy fish from fishermen in the vicinity of said
store (pp. 55-56, 68, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="6">June <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">23, </span>1972</st1:date>).
While passing by the store, Lorenzo was <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">surprised
</span>to see its door leading to the bodega already <span class="GramE">opened,</span>
and the dog inside the store <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the night
previous, already roaming outside. The </span>thought of robbery flashed in his
mind. So he went inside and found the drawers of the '<span class="SpellE">estantes</span>'
or display cabinets already opened. He called the name of Chua Chin alias
Julian but received no response. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">He </span>then
called the two <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">houseboys, Isidro <span class="SpellE">Ebrano</span> </span>and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Ebrano</span>,
who were sleeping at the mezzanine floor. The two boys did not say anything to
him about any incident. With a small <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">lamp
('<span class="SpellE">lamparilla</span>') borrowed from them, Lorenzo went </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to the room of the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">chinaman</span></span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and there found him lying on the cement floor
covered with a blanket. He rushed out­side and without bothering to tell the
houseboys what he saw, notified <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> Ferrando,
his compa<span class="SpellE">dre</span> and Assistant Manager of the store, of
the incident (pp. 56­-<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">62, </span>71-72,

July 18, 1972). Together, they returned to the store. <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span> instructed Lorenzo not to touch anything
while he (<span class="SpellE">Ferrando</span>) would go to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">poblacion</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> to report </span>the matter to the
authorities and the Chinese community. Lorenzo stood guard outside the store so
that nobody could enter until <span class="SpellE">Ferrando's</span> return (pp.
62-63, 106-110, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 23, 1972).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

arrived there at about 6:00 o'clock that same morning (pp. 207-208, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, July 18, 1972). While inside the store, they had to
use a <span class="SpellE">petromax</span> lamp as it was still <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">dark (pp. 209, 210, id.). They found the
victim in his bedroom lying on the cement floor with his face down covered with
a woolen blanket and an empty sack of flour (pp. 38-39, 42-44, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Dec. 15, 1972). His hands were tied at the back with a
rope (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "S", pp. 42-43, id.). When the
blanket and the empty sack were removed, his mouth was found to be covered with
a '<span class="SpellE">camiseta</span>' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"T") tied to the back (pp. 43-45, id.). The '<span class="SpellE">camiseta</span>'
he was wearing showed three (3) holes (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
"U-1", "U-2" &amp; "U-3") at the back (pp. 45-48,

argue that they could not have killed Chua Chin as alleged in the evening of
the preceding day. It suffices to state that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rabe</span>
merely expressed an opinion. And considering the fact that no persons other
than Alba et al. were seen at the scene of the crime, the dis­crepancy in

<p class="BODY">The trial court stated that the testimony of Isidro <span class="SpellE">Ebrano</span> was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">corroborated by the testimony of Jose <span class="SpellE">Sagang</span> and the extra-judicial confession </span>of <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Cervantes (Exhibit P). It is claimed that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">trial court </span>should
not have taken the Cervantes confession against Alba absent proof of

It said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"The
evidence has </span>clearly shown and esta­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">blished </span>conspiracy. As a matter of
fact, they were seen together by witness Jose <span class="SpellE">Sagang</span>
at the store of the victim before accused <span class="SpellE">Yolando</span>
Alba and the other person entered the bodega. This is corro­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">borated </span>by
the extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "P",
"P-1", "P-2") which states that they came together <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">from <span class="SpellE">Cateel</span> and
proceeded to the store </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
victim at barrio San Rafael. All these facts point to the existence of
conspiracy. The evidence on record </span>also affords no cogent explanation
why accused <span class="SpellE">Yolando</span> Alba and <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
Cervantes, together with another person whose identity has not been recognized
by the Prosecution witnesses, were at the store of the victim Chua Chin alias
Julian, at 9:00 o'clock in the evening of December 7, 1971 knocking at the window
and asking to buy gasoline <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">except </span>that
they were there with a united and common design to rob the victim. Since there
is conspiracy, although accused <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Cervantes
was only a mere look-out and had not actually part­icipated in the killing and
the taking of things of the victim Chua Chin alias Julian, he is still equally
liable with accused <span class="SpellE">Yolando</span> Alba in the commission of
the crime for in a conspiracy, the act of one conspirator is the act of
all." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Expediente</u></span>,
</span>pp. 574.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The extrajudicial confession of Cervantes is assailed on the
ground that it was obtained by force. True it is that an involuntary confession
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is inadmissible in evidence. But in
this case there is no proof that the confession was the fruit of coercion. The
trial court discussed this claim at length and its conclusion is amply
supported by the record. The trial court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"With respect to accused <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
Cervantes, said accused has impugned the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>
of his extra-judicial confession charging that said extra-­judicial confession
was obtained by means of violence and intimidation made by the PC men,
particularly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Sgt.
</span><span class="SpellE">Cabotaje</span> and Major <span class="SpellE">Bulusan</span>.
He declared that because of the maltreatment that he received from the PC men,
he submitted to an examination and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">medical
</span>treatment by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Batao</span>
of the NORCAMCO Clinic at <span class="SpellE">Lambajon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental, but said
accused has not presented any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">medical cer</span>tificate and gave the reason that
<span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Batao</span> refused to give
a medical certificate. On the alleged mal­treatment, he presented also
witnesses <span class="SpellE">Domiciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sobrecarey</span>
and Jose <span class="SpellE">Martinute</span> who attempted to show that there
was maltreatment made on him, but the testimonies of these two (2) witnesses do
not show how said accused was maltreated. They merely testified that they, as
suspects, were maltreated by the PC men during the time that they were at the
PC detachment in <span class="SpellE">Lambajon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>,
together with the herein two (2) accused. The Court cannot accept this
assertion because it is not clear and convincing. If really he had submitted
himself to a medical examination and treatment, there was no reason why he
could not produce any medical certificate of <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. <span class="SpellE">Batao</span> or he could have presented the said doctor on the
witness' stand to support his allegation. On this score, it is the considered
view of the Court that his allegation was merely a product of his attempt to
assail the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of the extra­judicial
confession made by him.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"While it is true that he was at the PC detachment during the
investigation, but imme­diately after said investigation he was brought to
Judge <span class="SpellE">Auxencio</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Dacuycuy</span>,
Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Oriental, before whom the said extra-judicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
"P", "P-1", "P-2") was subscribed. Judge <span class="SpellE">Dacuycuy</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">categorically
stated that before accused <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span> Cervantes affixed
his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>, the contents </span>of the said
Affidavit were explained to said accused, and the accused answered in the
affirmative upon being asked of the truth of the same. It is signi­ficant to
note that said Judge is the uncle of the accused because the mother of the
Judge bears the family name of Cervantes. If accused <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
Cervantes was really maltreated and coerced to execute the Affidavit, he could
have stated such fact to the Judge who happens to be his uncle. Said Judge
would have been the first to protect him if really he was maltreated and
intimidated.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another consideration that would belie the involuntariness of
the execution of the extra-judicial confession by accused <span class="SpellE">Ludovico</span>
Cervantes is the fact that this confession contains many details which could
have been supplied only by the accused himself. Some of these details narrated
in the earlier portion of this Decision are definitely facts that could not
have been supplied by any other person except the accused himself who had
actually participated in the commission of the crime.</blockquote>

his, although actually, according to him, he knows how to write his own

C. <span class="SpellE">Dacuycuy</span>, before whom the Affidavit was subscribed
