high school student of the <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> National
Comprehensive High School in <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, was walking on her way home (July 2, 1986 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
reaching a point in the diversion road near the <st1:place><st1:placename>Medicare</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> of the new <span class="SpellE">townsite</span>, she looked back and saw a male person jogging (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She continued walking (<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jogger overtook her and upon doing so,
suddenly turned back and took hold of her hands and started<span style=""> pulling </span>her towards the bushes (<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She resisted and hit him with fist blows on
hit chest (<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he was
pulling <span style="">her, </span>he threatened to
kill her by making a motion to pull something from his back (<u>Ibid</u>., <span style="">p. </span>9).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was finally able to pull <span style="">her </span>to
the bushes (<u>Ibid</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the bushes, he forcibly undressed her, removing both her
skirt and panty (<u>Ibid</u>., p<span style="">. </span>10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also undressed and forced her to <span class="GramE">lay</span> down on her back (<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then lay on top of her and began to kiss
her cheeks and lips (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 9-10).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this point, she was in tears (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he inserted his organ into her private
part (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
immediately felt a stab of pain (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 11) When he was <span style="">fini</span>shed, he
allowed her to dress up but warned her not to <span style="">report the </span>incident to the police
authorities (<u>Ibid</u>. p. 12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
victim then went home (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 13).</blockquote>

 8, 1985</st1:date>, accompanied by her uncle and auntie, she reported the
matter to <span style="">the </span>police authorities
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, she
was brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Medicare</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Community</st1:placename>

that he saw accused-appellant Gideon Barcelona jogging near the diversion road
in the late afternoon of <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="11">November 7,

(November 18, 1986 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon confrontation, the victim positively
identified accused-appellant as the person who raped her (July 2, 1986, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 14).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, accused-appellant was placed under arrest."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused Gideon Barcelona, however, denied that he committed the
crime imputed to him and interposed the defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court summarized the evidence for
the defense <span style="">as </span>follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The accused in his defense testified that he is presently 19
years old having been born on <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="11">November
 7, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was employed
since October 1985 in the fishing outfit of <span class="SpellE">Paning</span> <span class="SpellE">Paner</span> and has on their base at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cabugan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Palawan</span></span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Normally, they go to the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> every Saturday to haul water and supplies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1985</st1:date>, he was fetched by
P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> Castillo of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
Police Station and taken to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the said place he saw <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cayaon</span> as well as his brothers and sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged since complainant saw him, she did
not positively identified (sic) him but entertained doubts as the person who
raped her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Supporting in part <span style="">his
</span>testimony was the statement of witness Roger Mania, a detainee at the
municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place> at the time who alleged that he saw
suspect <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayaon</span> in
the early morning of <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="11">8 November, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 A.M.</st1:time> of the same day when victim saw <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayaon</span>, the former
identified the latter <span style="">as </span>the
one who raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further heard the
complainant describe that the person who raped her had curly hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suspect <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayaon</span> had curly hair while accused Gideon Barcelona had no
curly hair.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In addition to this, witness Jose <span class="SpellE">Lagrada</span>
testified that he was the companion of the accused at the fishing outfit of <span class="SpellE">Paning</span> <span class="SpellE">Paner</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brief, said witness testified that he knew
accused Gideon Barcelona.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both of them
were employed in said fishing outfit about the latter part of October, 1985 and
continued uninterruptedly until his arrest on <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He stated that their schedule of fishing is from <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 o'clock a.m.</st1:time> up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00
 <span class="GramE">o'clock p.m.</span></st1:time><span class="GramE"> .</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that from the last week of October

of Barcelona in their place of work nor did he visited (sic) accused in jail

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this appeal, the
accused-appellant claims that the trial court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in giving weight to the testimony of the
complainant which is allegedly materially inconsistent, contradictory and incredible:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and (2) in convicting the accused-appellant
when there is no evidence on </span>record <span style="">that his guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find no merit in the
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt </span>that <span style="">the complainant had been raped on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="11"><span style="">7
 November 1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, in
the manner testified to by her and affirmed by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">woman </span><span style="">testif</span><span style="">i</span>es<span style=""> </span><span style="">that she has </span>been <span style="">raped she says in effect all that is
necessary to show that rape was committed, </span>for <span style="">no young and decent Filipino woman would publicly admit that she has
been criminally ravished unless that is the truth, for her natural instinct is
to protect her honor.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Besides, complainant's
testimony is confirmed by the surrounding physical facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Medical examination of her genitalia in the
morning following the attack showed that (1) there was a slight mucosal
inflammation of the labia <span class="SpellE">majora</span>; (2) <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> laceration at 2:00 o'clock, 5:00 o'clock, and 9:00

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the outrage was immediately reported to the police
authorities after its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">removing</span> any doubt that the complainant may have concocted
her charge against the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends, however, that the crime of Rape<span style=""> </span>was not committed because no force or
intimidation was employed, i.e., no external injuries or bruises or scratches
were found on the complainant's body, despite her testimony that she was
dragged to the bushes, and that <span style="">the </span>complainant
did not offer tenacious and spirited resistance to the assault on her.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of physical injuries on the complainant's body does
not, of itself, negate the complainant's testimony that she was raped; nor does
it make the complainant a <span style="">willing
partner in the sex act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim need
not kick, bite, hit, slap or scratch with her fingernails the offender to
successfully claim that she had been raped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is enough that coition was undertaken against her will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient that the carnal knowledge
was done after the woman yielded because of an authentic apprehension of a real
fear of immediate death or great bodily harm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, there is evidence that the offended girl yielded to the
carnal desires of the appellant for fear that he might kill her since,
according to complainant, the appellant had threatened her with death and made
menacing gestures as if to draw a weapon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is this same fear that must have prevented her from making an outcry
or reporting the outrage to her uncle.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As the Court had said in
a case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "the force or violence required in rape
cases is relative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When applied, it need
not be too overpowering or irresistible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is essential is that the force used </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">sufficient to
consummate the purpose which the offender had in mind, or to bring about the
desired result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In using force, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not even necessary that the offender is armed with a weapon, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the use of a weapon serves only to increase the penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Intimidation can be addressed to the mind as
well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sum, the absence of external
signs or physical injuries does not negate the commission of the crime of
rape."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to the identity of the
perpetrator of the dastardly act, the complainant declared, and the trial court
agreed with her, that the appellant committed the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant positively identified the
accused as the person who raped her</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and, as the trial court said, she had <span class="GramE">no doubt nor</span> second thought about her identification of the
accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it would
appear that the complainant had no ill motive to testify falsely against the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the appellant was a
complete stranger to her and she did not know his name then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, when they <span class="GramE">came</span>
face to face, the second time, she readily pointed to the appellant as the
person who ravished her.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This Court has consistently held that the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant argues that
the testimony of the complainant should not be given weight and credence </span><span style="">because </span><span style="">it </span><span style="">is allegedly
inconsistent, contradictory and incredible </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) on direct examination, she declared that
in trying to repel the advances of the appellant, she bit him on the </span><span style="">left </span><span style="">forearm, whereas, on cross examination, she denied having stated that
she bit the appellant; (2) on direct examination, the complainant declared that
she did not report the incident to her uncle because she was afraid but, on
cross examination she stated that reported the incident to her uncle who, in
turn, reported it to the police; and </span><span style="">(3) </span><span style="">on direct examination,
the complainant testified that the sexual act took about twenty (20) minutes
and that she felt pain, but that she felt no ejaculation, while on cross
examination, she stated that there </span><span style="">was
</span><span style="">ejaculation inside her vagina.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These alleged contradictory
statements are not fatal </span>as <span style="">they
refer to relatively minor details, and they <span style="">are </span>to be expected from <span class="SpellE">uncoached</span>
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not affect, nor can
they prevail over the <u>positive</u> <u>identification</u> of the appellant </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">the rapist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As repeatedly held by the Court, discrepancies and inconsistencies in
the testimony of prosecution witnesses which refer to minor details do not
impair the probative value of their testimony.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The insinuation of the
