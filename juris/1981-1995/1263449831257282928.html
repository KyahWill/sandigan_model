				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the constitutionality of four resolu­tions of
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
regard­ing the acquisition of the wooden image of San Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> to be used in the celebration of his annual feast
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That issue was spawned by the
controversy as to whether the parish priest or a layman should have the custody
of the image.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1976</st1:date>,
the said <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council adopted Resolution No. 5,
"reviving the traditional socio-religious celebration" every fifth
day of April "of the feast day of <span class="SpellE">Señor</span> San
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, the patron saint of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>".</p>

<p class="BODY">That resolution designated the members of nine com­mittees who
would take charge of the 1976 festivity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It pro­vided for (1) the acquisition of the image of San Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> and (2) the construction of a waiting shed as the <span class="SpellE">barangay's</span> projects.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Funds for the two projects would be obtained through the "selling
of tickets and cash donations" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A or 6).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 26, 1976, the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council
passed Reso­lution No. 6 which specified that, in accordance with the practice
in Eastern <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, Councilman Tomas <span class="SpellE">Cabatingan</span>, the chairman or <span class="SpellE"><u>hermano</u></span>
<u>mayor</u> of the fiesta, would be the caretaker of the image of San Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> and that the image would remain in his residence for
one year and until the election of his successor as chairman of the next feast
day.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was further provided in the resolution that the image would be
made available to the Catholic parish church during the celebration of the <span class="GramE">saint' s</span> feast day (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B or 7).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Resolutions Nos. 5 and 6 were submitted to a plebiscite and were
duly ratified by the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> general assembly on <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two hundred seventy-two voters ratified the
two resolutions (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2 and 5).</p>

<p class="BODY">Funds were raised by means of solicitations and cash donations of
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> residents and those of the neighboring
places of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With those funds, the waiting shed was
constructed and the wooden image of San Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>
was acquired in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> by the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
council for four hundred pesos (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">F-1, 3 and 4).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1976</st1:date>,
the image was temporarily placed in the altar of the Catholic church of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
so that the devotees could worship the saint during the mass for the fiesta.</p>

<p class="BODY">A controversy arose after the mass when the parish priest, Father
Sergio <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span> <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>,
refused to return that image to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council
on the pretext that it was the property of the church because church funds were
used for its acquisition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several days after the fiesta or on <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1976</st1:date>, on the occasion of his sermon during a
mass, Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> allegedly uttered defamatory
remarks against the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain, Manuel C. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, apparently in connection with the disputed
image.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That incident provoked <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> to file against Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
in the city court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City a charge for grave
oral defamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> retaliated by filing
administrative com­plaints against <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> with the
city mayor's office and the De­partment of Local Government and Community
Development on the grounds of immorality, grave abuse of authority, acts
unbecoming a public official and ignorance of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the image of San Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>
remained in the Catholic church of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
did not accede to the request of <span class="SpellE">Cabatingan</span> to have
custody of the image and "maliciously ignored" the council's
Resolution No. 6, the council enacted on May 12, 1976 Resolution No. 10,
authorizing the hiring of a lawyer to file a <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
case against Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> for the recovery of the
image (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">C or 8).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="14" month="6">June
 14, 1976</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council passed
Resolution No. 12, appointing <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> as its
representative in the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> case (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">D or 9).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> case was filed in the city
court of <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City against Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> and Bishop <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Urgel</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After</span> the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
council had posted a cash bond of eight hun­dred pesos, Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span> turned over the image to the coun­cil (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his
answer to the complaint for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>, he assailed the
constitutionality of the said resolutions (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">F-1).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Later, he and three other persons, Andres <span class="SpellE">Garces</span>,
a member of the <span class="SpellE">Aglipayan</span> Church, and two Catholic
laymen, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Edullantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicetas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dagar</span>, filed against the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
council and its members (excluding two members) a complaint in the Court of
First Instance at <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City, praying for the
annulment of the said resolutions (Civil Case No. 1680-0).</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It upheld the validity of the
resolutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners appealed
under Republic Act No. 5440.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
council was not duly constituted because <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Mañago</span>, Jr., the chair­man of the <span class="SpellE">kabataang</span>
<span class="SpellE">barangay</span>, was not allowed to participate in its
sessions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Barangays</span> used to be known as citizens assemblies
(Presidential Decrees Nos. 86 and 86-A).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Presidential Decree No. 557, which took effect on <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1974</st1:date>, 70 <span class="SpellE">O.G</span>.
8450-L, directed that all barrios should be known as <span class="SpellE">barangays</span>
and adopted the Revised Barrio Charter as the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Charter.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Barrios are units of municipalities or municipal districts
in which they are situated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are
quasi-municipal corporations en­dowed with such powers" as are provided by
law “for the per­formance of particular government functions, to be exercised
by and through their respective barrio governments in conformity with law"
(Sec. 2, Revised Barrio Charter, <span class="SpellE">R.A</span>. No. 3590).</p>

<p class="BODY">The barrio assembly consists of all persons who are residents of
the <span class="GramE">barrio</span> for at least six months, eighteen years of
age or over and Filipino citizens duly registered in the list kept by the
barrio secretary (Sec. 4, <u>Ibid</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The barrio council, now <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
council, is composed of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain and six
councilmen (Sec. 7, <u>Ibid</u>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 3 of Presidential Decree No. 684, which took effect on April 15,
1975, provides that "the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> youth chairman
shall be an <u>ex-officio</u> member of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
council", having the same powers and functions as a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
councilman.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, <span class="SpellE">Mañago</span>, the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> youth chairman, was notified of the sessions of
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council to be held on March 23 and 26,
1976 but he was not able to attend those sessions because he was working with a
construction company based at <span class="SpellE">Ipil</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City (Par. 2[d], <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Mañago's</span> absence from the sessions of
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council did not render the said
resolutions void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a quorum
when the said resolutions were passed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other contention of the petitioners is that the reso­lutions
contravene the constitutional provisions that "no law shall be <span style="">made respecting </span>an establishment of
religion" and that "no public money or property shall ever be
appropriated, applied, paid, or used, directly or indirectly, for the use,
benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, sec­tarian institution,
or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support of any priest,
preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary as such, except
when such priest, preacher, minister, or dignitary is assigned to the armed
forces, or to any penal institution, or government orphanage or
leprosarium" (Sec. 8, Article IV and sec. 18[2], Article VIII,
Constitution).</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention is glaringly devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned resolutions do not directly or
indirectly establish any religion, nor abridge religious liberty, nor
appropriate public money or property for the benefit of any sect, priest or
clergyman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The image was purchased with
private funds, not with tax money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
construction of a waiting shed is entirely a secular matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Manifestly puerile and flimsy is petitioners' argu­ment that the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council favored the Catholic religion by using the
funds raised by solicitations and donations for the purchase of the patron
saint's wooden image and making the image available to the Catholic <span class="GramE">church</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The preposterousness of that argument is rendered more evident by
the fact that counsel advanced that argument in behalf of the petitioner,
Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, the parish priest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The wooden image was purchased in connection with the celebration
of the barrio fiesta honoring the patron saint, San Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
and <span class="GramE">not for the purpose of favoring any religion nor</span>
interfering with religious matters or the religious beliefs of the barrio
residents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the highlights of the
fiesta was the mass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
image of the patron saint had to be placed in the church when the mass was cele­brated.</p>

<p class="BODY">If there is nothing unconstitutional or illegal in holding a
fiesta and having a patron saint for the barrio, then any activity intended to
facilitate the worship of the patron saint (such as the acquisition and display
of his image) cannot be branded as illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted in the first resolution, the barrio fiesta is a
socio-religious affair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its celebration
is an ingrained tradition in rural communities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fiesta relieves the monotony and drudgery of the lives of the
masses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council designated a
layman as the custodian of the wooden image in order to forestall any suspicion
that it is favoring the Catholic <span class="GramE">church</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A more practical reason for that arrangement
would be that the image, if placed in a layman's custody, could easily be made
available to any family desiring to borrow the image in connection with prayers
and <span class="GramE">novenas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contradictory positions of the petitioners are shown in their
affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Garces</span> swore that the said re­solutions <u>favored the
Catholic <span class="GramE">church</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, petitioners <span class="SpellE">Dagar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Edullantes</span> swore that the resolutions <u>prejudiced the
Catholics</u> because they could see the image in the church only once a year
or during the fiesta (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">H and
J).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the momentous issues of separation of church and
state, freedom of religion and the use of public money to favor any sect or
church are not involved at all in this case even remotely or indirectly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a microcosmic test case on those
issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case is a petty quarrel over the custody of a saint's
image.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would never have arisen if the
parties had been more diplomatic and tactful and if Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>
had taken the trou­ble of causing contributions to be solicited from his own
pari­shioners for the purchase of <u>another image</u> of San Vicente <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> to be installed in his church.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that the image in question belongs to
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> council.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Father <span class="SpellE">Osmeña's</span> claim that it belongs to his
church is wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
council, as owner of the image, has the right to determine who should have
custody thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">If it chooses to change its mind and decides to give the image to
the Catholic <span class="GramE">church</span>, that action would <span style="">not violate </span>the Constitution because
the image was acquired with <u>private</u> <u>funds</u> and is its private
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The council has the right to take measures to recover possession
of the image by enacting Resolutions Nos. 10 and 12.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not every governmental activity which involves the expenditure of
public funds and which has some religious tint is <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the constitutional provisions regarding separa­tion of church and state,
freedom of worship and banning the use of public money or property.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span> vs. Ruiz, 64 Phil. 201, what
was involved was Act No. 4052 which appropriated sixty thousand pesos for the
cost of plates and the printing of postage stamps with new de­signs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under that law, the Director of Posts, with the approval of the
Department Head and the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
issued in 1936 postage stamps to commemorate the celebration in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
of the 33rd International Eucharistic Congress spon­sored by the Catholic
Church.</p>

<p class="BODY">The purpose of the stamps was to raise revenue and advertise the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The design of the stamps showed a map of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and nothing about the Catholic Church.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No religious purpose was intended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Monsignor Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Aglipay</span>, the founder
and head of the Philippine Independent Church, sought to enjoin the sale of
those commemorative postage stamps.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was held that the issuance of the stamps, while linked
inseparably with an event of a religious character, was not de­signed as <span class="GramE">a propaganda</span> for the Catholic Church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aglipay's</span>
prohibition suit was dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case is easily distinguishable from <span class="SpellE">Ver­zosa</span> vs. Fernandez, 49 Phil. 627 and 55 Phil. 307,
where a religious brotherhood, La <span class="SpellE">Archicofradia</span> del <span class="SpellE">Santisimo</span> Sacramento, organized for the purpose of raising
funds to meet the expenses for the annual fiesta in honor of the Most Holy
Sacrament and the Virgin Lady of Guadalupe, was held accountable for the funds
which it held as trustee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding that the petitioners have no cause of action for the
annulment of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> resolutions, the lower
court's judgment dismissing their amended petition is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I want to add
these observations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the images of saints
are not worshipped; they are venerated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Thou shall not have strange gods." A petty dispute on who
should have custody of the statue of San Vicente Ferrer should not have taken
up the time of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
can be no doubt that the statue was bought with private funds raised by the
barangay council which also decided who should have custody of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How the <u>cura</u> <u>parroco</u> got it
into his head that he should have custody of the statue defies logic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not, therefore, surprising to hear
statements that religion has no relevance to current problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let there be affirmation action by the
churches and less concern for inconsequential matters.</p>
