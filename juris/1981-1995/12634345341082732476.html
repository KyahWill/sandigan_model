<blockquote>"That the land, subject matter of registration, located in
Domalandan Center, Lingayen, Pangasinan, was originally owned by the late
Gregorio Aviles, father of the applicant, Paz Aviles Cruz, having bought the
said property.  After Gregorio Aviles
purchased the property, he declared the same for taxation purposes under Tax
Declaration Nos. 559, 694, 958 and 4629 (Exhibits K-5 to K-8) and took
possession over the land up to his death in 1940.  During the time that Gregorio Aviles was in physical possession
of the land, he introduced improvements, gathered and appropriated the fruits
of the existing coconut trees, camachili trees and bamboo grooves and nobody
ever disturbed him of (sic) his possession over the property.  There was also a distillery plant that was
constructed in the property by a corporation called Los Domalandaneses and it
was Gregorio Aviles who give (sic) the permission and consent in (sic) the
installation of said distillery plant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In April 1940, the late Gregorio Aviles executed a deed of assignment
in favor of his children (Exh. J) and the land in question was allotted to the
applicant as her share and after the death of Gregorio Aviles, his daughter,
Paz Aviles Cruz, took possession of the property in question and declared the
property for taxation purposes under tax Declaration Nos. 849, 553, 692, 966
and 62292 (Exhibits K to K-4) respectively and continued gathering and
appropriating the fruits of the improvements existing therein (bamboo grooves,
camachili and coconut trees).  Likewise,
in 1956, the applicant improved a part of the land by converting about one
hectare thereon into fishpond (sic) and after the fishpond was constructed, she
has (sic) it leased to different persons, namely, Felix Aviles for 5 years,
Bernabe de Vera for 10 years, Toribio Magsanoc for 15 years and Jeorge Aquino
for 5 years as shown by the contract of lease executed between the applicant
and the lessees (Exhs. M, N and 0); that the lease rentals were paid to the
herein applicant and that nobody shared with her in the said rentals.  Applicant was likewise never molested or
disturbed in her possession over the property and the real estate taxes were
paid by Paz A. Cruz as evidenced by tax receipts showing her payment of said taxes
(Exhibits L to L-7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>That originally the area appearing in the
tax declaration of the land was only one and one-half (1½) hectares but the
area was gradually increased to; 2½ hectares on the southern part of the
property starting from 1934 up to 1966 and that the portion constituting the accretion
(sic) is indicated in the plan from point 4 (Exhibit A-1); that the property in
question and the property owned by private oppositor are divided by concrete
monuments and growing coconut trees.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

public respondent resolved the appeal in favor of the private respondent on the
basis of the following <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">findings </span>and
conclusions, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The applicant admitted she originally owned only 1 ½ hectares
but her land increased by accretion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Against this claim of accretion is the documentary evidence that
the disputed portion of the land was sold by Gregorio Aviles original owner of
whole (sic) land to Fortunata Aviles <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as
</span>shown in the deed of sale (Exh. 4).  Fortunata Aviles in turn sold said portion to the herein oppositor.  Since the sale of the disputed portion to
Fortunata Aviles the land was in her possession in concept of owner until she
transferred it to the herein oppositor.  Aside from the tax declaration and payment of taxes.  The (sic) oppositor in fact exercised acts of
ownership of (sic) said portion by mortgaging the residential and fishpond areas
for a loan of P3,000.00 to the Rural Bank of Bugallon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On this score, We do not give much credence to the appellee's
contention that the identity of the land in the <u>Escritura</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">de</span></u><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span></b><u>Compraventa</u> is not precise.  It is assumed that the Rural Bank of
Bugallon which accepted the land in dispute was identified and inspected by
bank inspectors before accepting it as collateral.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, the accretion on the land of appellant applicant which
was originally only 1½ hectares can be only minimal considering that the body
of water adjacent to said land or canal as shown in the Commissioner's Report
(sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the boundary between two estates is a river or a tream (sic),
the bed of which belongs to neither <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>them,
the gradual increase of one side is for the benefit thereof and does not
prejudice the property on the opposite side because, in accordance with the
provisions of Article 366 of the Civil Code, the owner of an estate increased
by alluvion (sic) acquires the title by accretion.  (Roxas vs. Tuason, 9 Phil. 408).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, if indeed there was an accretion, the land of the
oppositor would have also been benefitted (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is obvious therefore that the applicant had encroached on the
land of the private oppositor Erlinda Estrada.  On this score the tax declaration submitted by the applicant showing
that it has an area of 25,224 started only in 1980 while the tax declaration of
the land claimed by the oppositor in the name of her predecessor-in­-interest
Fortunata Aviles started in 1951.  (Exh.
5, p. 162, rec.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is to be noted also that the original decision adjudicated 3,383
square meters to the oppositor Erlinda Estrada.  The trial court amended its decision correcting some clerical
error (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view thereof, the Court is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">constrained

discretion because although only a portion of Lot 2040 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

It thus behooves this Court to review the public respondent's findings of fact
and conclusions based thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise agree with the petitioner's allegation that the
dispositive portion of the assailed decision is confusing.  This confusion arises from the public
respondent's failure to distinguish, based on the proposed Subdivision Plan
submitted in evidence by the private respondent (Exhibit "9"), Lot
No. 2040 from Lot No. 2040-A.  It also
stems from the public respondent's failure to take into account the fact that
while in her opposition to the application for registration, private respondent
specifies only two (2) parcels of land, with a total area of 6,683 square
meters, which she acquired from her grandmother Fortunata Aviles who in turn
bought these lots from Gregorio Aviles (father of the petitioner), in her
Oppositor­-Appellant's Brief, she mentions three (3) portions, which constitute
the property acquired from her grandmother, without specifying their respective
areas.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The portion bought by Fortunata Aviles consists of (a) the
residential portion which is bounded on the N. by Erlinda Estrada; on the S. by
Fortunata Aviles (fishpond portion); on the E. by Tranquilino Manaoat; and on
the W. by Castor Aviles and Paz Aviles;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  the fishpond portion which is bounded on
the N. by Fortunata Aviles (the residential portion) on the E. by Tranquilino
Manaoat; on the S. by the nipa land portion; and on the W. by Castor Aviles and
Paz Aviles (TSN ibid, Erlinda Estrada p. 35 January 30, 1984 p. 16) and the</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)  nipaland portion which is bounded on the N.
by the fishpond portion; on the E. by Maria Manaoat; on the S. by Agno River
and on the W. by Paz Aviles Cruz (TSN ibid Erlinda Estrada January 16, 1984, p.
16);"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent undertook no serious efforts in her Brief,
Comment or Memorandum filed in CA-G.R. CV No. 08030 to identify these three (3)
portions <i>vis-a-vis</i> the two (2) parcels described in her opposition --
the first of which is identified as "unirrigated riceland", while the
second is plainly described as a parcel of land.  She also failed to indicate the so-called fishpond and nipa land
portions over which she claims ownership.  The reason for this seems to be that these did not originally<span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span>form part of the two (2) parcels.  As unequivocally admitted in the private
respondent's third assignment of error, the so-called fishpond and nipa land
portions "ARE ACTUALLY ACCRETION OF (sic) THE RESIDENTIAL PORTION WHICH THE
TRIAL COURT CORRECTLY AWARDED TO HER."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
There is, however, nothing in her discussion of this assigned error to support
her theory.  Upon the other hand, since,
as determined by the land registration court, the property acquired by
Fortunata Aviles from Gregorio Aviles lies on the northeastern portion of the
property sought to be registered by the petitioner, it is not possible for the
Agno River to be on the former’s boundary.  The private respondent, in her aforesaid Brief,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
agreed with this conclusion.   Said the
trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The contention of the herein private oppositor is
however vague and ambiguous because if we carefully examine and peruse the
meter (sic) and bounds of the property sold by Gregorio Aviles appearing in
Exhibit 4 (Deed of Sale) the land sold by Gregorio Aviles in favor of Fortunata
Aviles and her co-vendees is bounded on the S. by the property of the seller,
Grerio Aviles and not the Agno River.  x
x x."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <i>Escritura de Compraventa</i> (Exhibit "4")
executed by Gregorio Aviles on 15 July 1939 also shows that the Agno River does
not run along any of the boundaries of the subject property; the one (1)
hectare portion sold to Teodorico, Petra, Prudencio, Castor and Fortunata is
bounded by properties owned by the following: on the North by Alvaro Reyes and
Felizardo Manaoat; on the East by Felizardo Manaoat; on the South by Gregorio
Aviles; and on the West by Juan O. Reyes.  Indeed, the Agno River is not located in any of its boundaries.  Thus, the share pertaining to Fortunata
Aviles, which the private respondent had acquired, cannot possibly have the
Agno River as a boundary.  The
unqualified admission by the private respondent that the fishpond and nipa land
portions are accretions conflicts with, and therefore removes the basis for, the
public respondent's conclusion that the property purchased by Fortunata Aviles
from Gregorio Aviles consists of three (3) portions, namely: residential,
fishpond and nipa land portions.  This
adds force to the petitioner's contention that the public respondent's
conclusions are devoid of evidentiary support.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the property on the southern boundary of the second parcel
described in the private respondent's aforementioned opposition in the land
registration case, is not the <u>Agno</u> <u>River</u>.  The <u>Agno</u> <u>River</u> is situated
along the southern boundary of the land applied for by the petitioner.  Consequently, the accretions by reason of
the action of the said river could only benefit the petitioner.  The land registration court did not,
therefore, err in holding that the increase in the area of the property
belonging to the petitioner was due to accretion.  It thus necessarily follows that the public respondent's
conclusion -- that the accretion can only be minimal and if indeed there was
such an accretion, the land of the private respondent would also have been
benefited -- is purely conjectural and based on an erroneous premise that the
property subject of the <i>Escritura de Compraventa</i> has the Agno River as
one of its boundaries.  Equally
erroneous, if not certainly illogical, is its postulation that it cannot give
much credence to the petitioner's contention -- that the identity of the land
in the <i>Escritura de Compraventa</i> is imprecise -- because it is assumed
that the land in dispute, which was accepted by the Rural Bank of Bugallon as a
security for a loan, was identified and inspected by bank inspectors.  There is no evidence at all that the said <i>Escritura
de Compraventa</i> was shown to and examined by bank inspectors.  Besides, Fortunata was only one (1) of five
(5) vendees who declared, for taxation purposes, her share therein.  If any inspection was conducted by the Bank,
only that portion so declared by her may have been inspected.  Moreover, acceptance by the bank of property
as security for the loan is not evidence of the correctness of the boundaries
of the land or of its total area.</p>

<p class="BODY">Doubtless, the findings of fact of the trial court are fully
supported by the evidence.</p>
