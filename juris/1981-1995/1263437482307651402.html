				<H3>ERLINDA B. CAUSAPIN AND ALBERTO CAUSAPIN, PETITIONERS, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, EUSEBIO CALUGAY, RENATO MANALO, LORENZA MANALO AND BENJAMIN C. NADURATA, JR., AND SPOUSES DOMINADOR S. DE GUZMAN AND ANASTACIA BATAS, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners are the heirs of Agapito Causapin who died in October
1954 leaving a 473-square meter lot in Niugan, Cabuyao, Laguna.  On 25 June 1963, they partitioned the land
between them and the corresponding tax declarations were issued in their
individual names.  Erlinda resided in
the land until 1963 when she went to work in Manila.  When she got married she settled in Mandaluyong.  Meanwhile, the land was left to the care of
her cousin, respondent Lorenza Manalo.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1986, Erlinda returned to Niugan and discovered that a
building was being constructed on the land.  Upon inquiry from the Register of Deeds of Calamba, Laguna, she learned
that it was already titled in the name of respondent-spouses Dominador de
Guzman and Anastacia Batas under Original Certificate of Title No. P-1796.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 July 1986, Erlinda and Alberto lodged a complaint before
the Regional Trial Court of Laguna for rescission of deeds of sale and
cancellation of OCT No. P-1796 against respondent-spouses Dominador de Guzman
and Anastacia, Eusebio Calugay, Renato Manalo, Lorenza Manalo and Benjamin C.
Nadurate, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">Erlinda Causapin claimed that she never sold her share of the
property to anyone and that the signature appearing on the document purportedly
conveying her share to respondent Eusebio Calugay was not hers.  With respect to Alberto's share, he claimed
that he was intimidated by respondent-spouses Renato and Lorenza Manalo, as
well as respondent-spouses Dominador and Anastacia de Guzman into signing an
already prepared deed of sale on the pretense that he would receive the
consideration of the sale as soon as Erlinda could sign the deed as
administratrix of the land.  However, up
to the date of the filing of the complaint, he never received a centavo from
the de Guzmans.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent-spouses de Guzman asserted that
sometime in 1967 they purchased from Renato Manalo a 221-square meter parcel of
land for P3,000.00, evidenced by a "Kasulatan ng Bilihang Tuluyan"
dated 17 July 1967.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The land was supposed to have been acquired by respondent Renato Manalo from
respondent Eusebio Calugay through a "Bilihan ng Lupa na Walang
Titulo" dated 26 October 1966 for P2,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> In
turn, respondent Eusebio Calugay bought the property from petitioner Erlinda
Causapin on 29 July 1963 for P1,500.00 as evidenced by a "Bilihang
Tuluyan."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then on 17 August 1967, the de Guzmans bought the share of
petitioner Alberto for P2,500.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> Upon
acquisition of the two parcels of land, the de Guzmans applied for a free
patent.  On 28 April 1977, OCT No.
P-1796 was issued in their name.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> Since
then they have been paying the land taxes up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">Leonila Calugay, wife of respondent Eusebio Calugay, contended
that in the early part of 1980, Erlinda borrowed P2,500.00 from her which loan
was secured by Tax Declaration No. 8155.  Later, Erlinda redeemed the land.  Leonila, Erlinda and Eusebio executed the document of redemption in an
office at Escolta, Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Lorenza Manalo attempted to show that her husband,
respondent Renato Manalo, acquired Erlinda's share through purchase from
respondent Eusebio Calugay.  The
document of sale was prepared and notarized on 26 October 1964 in an office at
Escolta, Manila, in the presence of respondent Calugay, Renato, and
herself.  The document of sale from
respondent Renato to respondent-spouses de Guzman was prepared and notarized in
the same office although respondent Lorenza Manalo could not remember when it
was.  She remembers however having acted
as witness to the execution of the document.</p>

<p class="BODY">Weighing the foregoing conflicting evidence, the trial court
concluded there was no valid transfer of the property of Erlinda to
respondents.  Its conclusion was based
on the following:  (a) Erlinda was a
minor and single when the deed of sale between her and respondent Eusebio
Calugay was executed; (b) the alleged deed of sale to Eusebio Calugay was
spurious and a forgery considering the testimony of Leonila that the property
was used as collateral for Erlinda's loan when she was already married with
three children and a resident of Mandaluyong; (c) granting that the document
was one of mortgage, it was unlikely that the consideration was only P1,500.00,
as the document stated, because the loan obtained by Erlinda was for P2,500.00;
(d) Erlinda's signature on the document was different from her signature on the
verification of the complaint and on the deed of sale between petitioner
Alberto and respondent-spouses de Guzman; (e) respondents Eusebio and Leonila
denied having signed any deed of sale; (f) the notary public did not submit to
the trial court a copy of the document evidencing the sale between respondents
Eusebio Calugay and Renato Manalo; and, (g) the Tax Declaration of respondent
Renato was not presented by respondent-spouses de Guzman.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the trial court declared as valid the sale of Alberto's
share to respondent-spouses de Guzman because he failed to persuade the court
that no consideration was paid for the sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although an action to annul a deed of conveyance or contract
based on minority or lack of capacity to enter into the deed must be brought
within four years from the time such incapacity ceases,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> the
trial court nevertheless granted Erlinda's prayer.  It relied on the principle of equity since it found that the de
Guzman couple did not act in good faith, which consisted in their failure to
offer in evidence the tax declaration of respondent Renato Manalo.  Thus, on 13 October 1989, it rendered its
judgment:  (a) ordering therein
defendant-spouses Dominador and Anastacia de Guzman to pay plaintiffs the sum
equivalent to the present valuation of real property per square meter at
Niugan, Cabuyao, Laguna; (b) declaring that defendant-spouses de Guzman may
pursue a claim for reimbursement and damages against defendant-spouses Renato
Manalo and Lorenza Manalo; (c) ordering defendant-spouses Renato and Lorenza Manalo
to jointly and severally pay plaintiff Erlinda Causapin P10,000.00 as moral
damages and P10,000.00 as compensatory damages; (d) ordering defendant-spouses
Dominador and Anastacia de Guzman jointly and severally with co-defendants
Renato and Lorenza Manalo to pay plaintiff Erlinda P5,000.00 as attorney's fees
plus cost; and, (e) relieving defendant-spouses Eusebio Calugay and Leonila
Calugay of any civil liability as they did not participate in the fraudulent
act but instead duped into signing a document of sale which the latter believed
to be a document of redemption by Erlinda Causapin.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 September 1992, at the instance of respondent-spouses de
Guzman, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
upon finding that:  (a) the deeds of
sale, being duly notarized, could not be brushed aside and rendered
inefficacious simply by the uncorroborated testimony of petitioner Erlinda; (b)
the failure of the notary public to transmit the deed of sale between
respondents Eusebio and Renato to the then Court of First Instance of Manila
and the Bureau of Archives did not, in any manner, convert it into a private
document or invalidate the same; at most, it might render the notary public
administratively liable for his omission; (c) equity is applied only in the
absence of, and never against statutory law or judicial rules of procedure,
much more the law on prescription; (d) the general rule is that an original
certificate of title issued on the strength of a homestead patent partakes of
the nature of a certificate issued in a judicial proceeding and becomes
indefeasible and incontrovertible at the expiration of one (1) year from the
date of the issuance of the patent; (e) even assuming that OCT No. P-1796
issued to respondent-spouses de Guzman could still be set aside, an action for
annulment of a patent should be filed only by the Solicitor General pursuant to
Sec. 101 of Commonwealth Act No. 141; and, (f) there was no conclusive evidence
that respondent-spouses de Guzman acted in bad fai<span style="">t</span>h.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petition, it is alleged that the Court of Appeals
completely failed to give probative value to the attendant facts and the
testimony of petitioner Erlinda with respect to the purported source of all the
conveyances, the "Salaysay ng Paghahati." While that document and the
alleged deed of sale between petitioner Erlinda and respondent Eusebio Calugay
stated that Erlinda was of age, she however testified under oath that she was
only seventeen (17) years old in 1963.  Therefore, said documents transferred no rights whatsoever to
respondents due to Erlinda's incapacity by reason of minority.  Moreover, Erlinda testified that she did not
execute said documents, in which event, prescription did not lie against her
and her brother.  Consequently, the subsequent
conveyances were also void and that respondent-spouses de Guzman were not
purchasers in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are in full conformity with appellate court's reversal of the
trial court's decision.  The disputed
deeds of sale, namely:  (a)
"Bilihang Tuluyan" dated 29 July 1963 between petitioner Erlinda and
respondent Eusebio; (b) "Bilihan ng Lupa na Walang Titulo" dated 26
October 1966 between respondents Eusebio and Renato; and, (c) "Kasulatan
ng Bilihang Tuluyan" dated 17 July 1967 between respondents Renato and
spouses de Guzman, were all duly notarized.  In this connection, we have held that when the evidence as to the
validity or nullity of a notarial document is conflicting, in the absence of a
clear, strong and convincing evidence showing such falsity, the document should
be upheld.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners sought rescission of those documents on two
grounds:  first, Erlinda "never
executed nor signed any document or any deed of sale whatsoever transferring or
selling her share on the real property x x x to defendants or to any person for
that matter;"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
second, she was still a minor at the time she allegedly executed the deed of
sale in favor of respondent Eusebio.  It
should be pointed out that petitioners' prayer for rescission is erroneous
because this remedy only applies to contracts validly agreed upon by the
parties in the cases established by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Anyway, the error appears to concern terminology only because petitioners are
actually assailing the validity of said documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court resolved the first ground in this wise:  "x x x on close observation, the
signature of Erlinda appearing on the alleged Deed of Sale to Eusebio, which is
of course denied, is very different from her signature appearing in the verification
of her complaint in the instant case, and even in the Deed of Sale from Alberto
Causapin to the de Guzmans which Erlinda signed as Administratrix."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
This is a loose end which the lower court failed to settle.  An accurate examination to determine forgery
should dwell <span style="">on both the differences
and similarities in the questioned signatures.  The reason for this kind of examination was explained in </span><b>Cesar
v. Sandiganbayan:</b><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<blockquote>There are two main questions, or difficulties, that confront the
examiner of an alleged forgery.  The
first of these is to determine how much and to what extent genuine writing will
diverge from a certain type, and the second is how and to what extent will a
more or less skillful forgery be likely to succeed and be likely to fail in
embodying the essential characteristics of a genuine writing.  Here we have the very heart of the problem,
for, at least in some measure, a forgery will be like the genuine writing, and
there is also always bound to be some variation in the different examples of
genuine writing by the same writer.  Incorrect
reasoning infers forgery from any variation or infers genuineness from any
resemblance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The process of identification, therefore, must include the
determination of the extent, kind, and significance of this resemblance as well
as of the variation.   It then becomes
necessary to determine whether the variation is due to the operation of a
different personality, or is only the expected and inevitable variation found
in the genuine writing of the same writer.  It is also necessary to decide whether the resemblance is the result of
a more or less skillful imitation, or is the habitual and characteristic
resemblance which naturally appears in a genuine writing.  When these two questions are correctly
answered the whole problem of identification is solved.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A comparison of Erlinda's signature in the "Bilihang
Tuluyan" with her signatures on the other documents reveals that the
slight differences in strokes are overshadowed by the significant
similarities.  These similarities
suffice to convince us that the signature of petitioner Erlinda on the deed of
sale between her and respondent Eusebio is genuine; a fortiori, the deed of
sale between them is valid.  Moreover,
it is highly noticeable that the signatures of Erlinda that were analyzed by
the trial court are on documents executed several years apart, to wit, 29 July
1963, 17 August 1967 and 20 June 1986.  The passage of time and a person's increase in age may have decisive
influences in his writing characteristics.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, authorities are of the opinion that in order to bring about an accurate
comparison and analysis, the standards of comparison must be as close as
possible in point of time to the suspected signature.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second ground, Art. 1391 of the Civil Code is
specific that the action for annulment of a contract entered into by minors or
other incapacitated persons shall be brought within four years from the time
the guardianship ceases.  Conformably
with this provision, Erlinda should have filed a complaint for annulment within
four (4) years from 1966 when she turned 21.  Her claim of minority has undoubtedly prescribed when the complaint was
filed in 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, petitioners' action for the cancellation of OCT No.
P-1796 was not properly instituted.  It
should be remembered that the questioned property was a public land.  We have held in a multitude of cases, among
which are <b>Lopez v. Padilla</b><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> and <b>Maximo
v. CFI of Capiz,</b><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> that
Sec. 101 of the Public Land Act vests only in the Solicitor General or the
officer acting in his stead the authority to institute the action on behalf of
the Republic for cancellation of title and for reversion of the homestead to
the Government.  A recognized exception
is that situation where plaintiff-claimant seeks direct reconveyance from
defendant public land unlawfully and in breach of trust titled by him, on the
principle of enforcement of a constructive trust, but such principle is in no
way applicable nor even invoked in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, an original certificate of title issued on the
strength of a homestead patent is equivalent to a certificate issued in a
judicial proceeding and becomes indefeasible and incontrovertible after one (1)
year from the date of issuance thereof;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> in
this case, one year from 28 April 1977.  The exception is where an action for the cancellation of a patent and
the certificate of title pursuant thereto is instituted on the ground that they
are void because the Bureau of Lands had no <span style="">jurisdiction to issue them at all, the land in question </span>having
been withdrawn from the public domain prior to the subsequent award of the
patent and the grant of a certificate of title to another person, which does
not obtain in this case.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As aforestated, the trial court granted relief to petitioner
Erlinda based on equity since it found that respondent-spouses de Guzman acted
in bad faith when they acquired the land.  Equity, which has been aptly described as "a justice outside
legality," is applied only in the absence of, and never against, statutory
law or judicial rules of procedure.  The
pertinent positive rules being present here, they should pre-empt and prevail
over all abstract arguments based only on equity.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, respondent-spouses de Guzman did not act in bad faith because there
was no evidence of impropriety in the sale made by respondent Renato Manalo to
them.</p>
