				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two cases, both for the recovery of the value of cargo insurance,
arose from the same incident, the sinking of the M/S ASIATICA when it caught
fire, resulting in the total loss of ship and cargo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic facts are not in controversy:</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>G.R. No. 69044</u>, sometime in or prior to June, 1977, the
M/S ASIATICA, a vessel operated by petitioner Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc.,
(referred to hereinafter as Petitioner Carrier) loaded at Kobe, Japan for
transportation to Manila, 5,000 pieces of <span class="SpellE">calorized</span>
lance pipes in 28 packages valued at P256,039.00 consigned to Philippine Bloom­ing
Mills Co., Inc., and 7 cases of spare parts valued at P92,361.75, consigned to
Central Textile Mills, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both sets of
goods were insured against marine risk for their stated value with respondent
Development Insurance and Sure­ty Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>G.R. No. 71478</u>, during the same period, the same vessel
took on board 128 cartons of garment fabrics and accessories, in two (2)
containers, consigned to <span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span> Apparel
Corporation, and two cases of surveying instruments consigned to <span class="SpellE">Aman</span> Enterprises and General Merchandise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The 128 cartons were insured for their stated
value by respondent Nisshin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. for US$46,583.00,
and the 2 cases by respondent Dowa Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd., for
US$11,385.00</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Enroute</span> from Kobe, Japan, to Manila,
the vessel caught fire and sank, resulting in the total loss of ship and
cargo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respective respondent
Insurers paid the corresponding marine insurance values to the consignees
concerned and were thus subrogated unto the rights of the latter as insured.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:left" align="left"><u>G.R. NO. 69044<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 11, 1978, respondent Development Insurance &amp; Surety
Corporation (Development Insurance, for short), having been subrogated unto the
rights of the two insured companies, filed suit against petitioner Carrier for
the recovery of the amounts it had paid to the insured before the then Court of
First Instance of Manila, Branch XXX (Civil Case No. 116087).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-Carrier denied liability mainly on the ground that the
loss was due to an extraordinary fortuitous event, hence, it is not liable
under the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 31, 1979, the Trial Court rendered judgment in favor of
Development Insurance in the amounts of P256,039.00 and P92,361.75,
respectively, with legal interest, plus P35,000.00 as attorney's fees and
costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Carrier took an appeal
to the then Court of Appeals which, on August 14, 1984, affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Carrier is now before us on a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:left" align="left"><u>G.R. NO. 71478<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 16, 1978, respondents Nisshin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance
Co. (NISSHIN, for short), and Dowa Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. (DOWA,
for brevity), as <span class="SpellE">subrogees</span> of the insured, filed suit
against Petitioner Carrier for the recovery of the insured value of the cargo
lost with the then Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch II (Civil Case No.
116151), imputing <span class="SpellE">unseaworthiness</span> of the ship and
non-observance of extraordinary diligence by Petitioner Carrier.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Carrier denied liability on the principal grounds that
the fire which caused the sinking of the ship is an exempting circumstance
under Section 4(2) (b) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA); and that
when the loss by fire is established, the burden of proving negli­gence of the
vessel is shifted to the cargo shipper.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 15, 1980, the Trial Court rendered judg­ment in
favor of NISSHIN and DOWA in the amounts of US$46,583.00 and US$11,385.00,
respectively, with legal interest, plus attorney's fees of P5,000.00 and
costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal by petitioner, the then
Court of Appeals on September 10, 1984, affirmed with modification the Trial
Court's judgment by decreasing the amount recoverable by DOWA to US$1,000.00
because of the $500 per package limitation of liability under the COGSA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> by
Petitioner Carrier.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both Petitions were initially denied for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>G.R. No. 69044 on January 16, 1985 by the
First Division, and G.R. No. 71478 on September 25, 1985 by the Second
Division.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon Petitioner Carrier's
Motion for Reconsi­deration, however, G.R. No. 69044 was given due course on
March 25, 1985, and the parties were required to submit their respective
Memoranda, which they have done.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, in G.R. No. 71478, Petitioner Carrier sought
reconsideration of the Resolution denying the Petition for Review and moved for
its consolidation with G.R. No. 69044, the lower-numbered case, which was then
pending resolution with the First Division.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same was granted; the Resolution of the Second Division of <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1985</st1:date> was set aside and
the Petition was given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, we reject Petitioner Carrier's claim that it is
not the operator of the M/S <span class="SpellE">Asiatica</span> but merely a <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We note that in G.R. No. 69044, Petitioner Carrier stated in its
Petition:</p>

<blockquote>"There are about 22 cases of the 'ASIATICA' pend­ing in
various courts where various plaintiffs are repre­sented by various counsel
representing various consignees or insurance companies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The common defendant in these cases is
petitioner herein, being the operator of said vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Carrier should be held bound to said ad­mission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a general rule, the facts alleged in a
party's pleading are deemed admissions of that party and binding upon it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
And an admission in one pleading in one action may be received in evidence
against the pleader or his successor-in-interest on the trial of another action
to which he is a party, in favor of a party to the latter action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The threshold issues in both cases are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) which law should govern - the Civil Code
provisions on common carriers or the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and (2) who has the burden of proof to show
negligence of the carrier?</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:left" align="left"><u>On the Law
Applicable<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The law of the country to which the goods are to be transported
governs the liability of the common carrier, in case of their loss, destruction
or deterioration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
As the cargoes in question were transported from Japan to the Philippines, the
liability of Petitioner Carrier is governed primarily by the Civil Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
However, in all matters not regulated by said Code, the rights and obliga­tions
of common carrier shall be governed by the Code of Commerce and by special
laws.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, a special law, is <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span>
to the provisions of the Civil Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:left" align="left"><u>On the Burden of
Proof<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Civil Code, common carriers, from the nature of their
business and for reasons of public policy are bound to observe extraordinary
diligence in the vigilance over goods, according to all the circumstances of
each case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Common carriers are responsible for the loss, destruction, or deterioration of
the goods unless the same is due to any of the following causes only:</p>

<blockquote>"(1) Flood, storm, earthquake, lightning or other natural
disaster or calamity;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Carrier claims that the loss of the vessel by fire
exempts it from liability under the phrase "natural disaster or
calamity".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, we are of the
opinion that fire may not be considered a natural disaster or calamity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This must be so as it arises almost invariably
from some act of man or by human means.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It does not fall within the category of an act of God unless caused by
lightning<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
or by other natural disaster or calamity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It may even be caused by the actual fault or <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of the carrier.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1680 of the Civil Code, which considers fire as an
extraordinary fortuitous event refers to leases of rural lands where a
reduction of the rent is allowed when more than one-half of the fruits have
been lost due to such event, considering that the law adopts a protective
policy towards agriculture.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As the peril of fire is not comprehended within the exceptions in
Article 1734, <u>supra</u>, Article 1735 of the Civil Code provides that in all
cases other than those mentioned in Article 1734, the common carrier shall be
presumed to have been at fault or to have acted negligently, unless it proves
that it has observed the extraordinary diligence re­quired by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the respective Insurers, as <span class="SpellE">subrogees</span>
of the cargo shippers, have proven that the transported goods have been
lost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Carrier has also proven
that the loss was caused by fire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
burden then is upon Petitioner Carrier to prove that it has exercised the
extraordinary diligence required by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this regard, the Trial Court, concurred in by the Appellate Court,
made the following finding of fact:</p>

<blockquote>"The cargoes in question were, according to the witnesses for
the defendant, placed in hatches No. 2 and 3 of the vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Boatswain Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pastrana</span>
noticed that smoke was coming out from hatch No. 2 and hatch No. 3; that when
the smoke was noticed, the fire was already big; that the fire must have
started twenty-four (24) hours before the same was noticed; that carbon dioxide
was ordered released and the crew was ordered to open the hatch covers of No. 2
hold for commencement of fire fighting by sea water; that all of these efforts
were not enough to control the fire.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to Article 1733, common carriers are bound to
observe extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over the goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of the defendant did not show
that extraordinary vigilance was observed by the vessel to prevent the
occurrence of fire at hatches num­bers 2 and 3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant's evidence did not likewise show the amount of diligence made
by the crew, on orders, in the care of the cargoes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What appears is that after the cargoes were
stored in the hatches, no regular inspect­ion was made as to their condition
during the voyage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
crew could not even explain what could have caused the fire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendant, in the Court’s mind, failed to
satisfactorily show that extraordinary vigilance and care had been made by the
crew to prevent the occur­rence of the fire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The defendant, as a common carrier, is liable to the consignees for said
lack of diligence required of it under Article 1733 of the Civil Code."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having failed to discharge the burden of proving that it had
exercised the extraordinary diligence required by law, Petitioner Carrier
cannot escape liability for the loss of the cargo.</p>

<p class="BODY">And even if fire were to be considered a "natural disaster''
within the meaning of Article 1734 of the Civil Code, it is required under
Article 1739 of the same Code that the "natural disaster" must have
been the "proximate and only cause of the loss", and that the carrier
has "exercised due diligence to prevent or minimize the loss before,
during or after the occurrence of the disaster".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, Peti­tioner Carrier has also failed to
establish satisfactorily.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor may Petitioner Carrier seek refuge from liability under the
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
provided therein that:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 4(2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither the
carrier nor the ship shall be responsible for loss or damage arising or
resulting from</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'(b) Fire, unless caused by the actual fault or <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
of the carrier.</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this case, both the Trial Court and the Appellate Court, in
effect, found, as a fact, that there was "actual fault" of the
carrier shown by "lack of diligence" in that "when the smoke was
noticed, the fire was already big; that the fire must have started twenty-four
(24) hours before the same was noticed;" and that "after the cargoes
were stored in the hatches, no regular inspection was made as to their
condition during the voyage." The foregoing suffices to show that the
circumstances under which the fire originated and spread are such as to show
that Petitioner Carrier or its servants were negligent in connection
therewith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the complete
defense afforded by the COGSA when loss results from fire is unavailing to
Petitioner Carrier.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:left" align="left"><u>On the US $500 Per
Package Limitation:<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Carrier avers that its liability if any, should net
exceed US$500 per package as provided in section 4(5) of the COGSA, which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"(5) Neither the carrier nor the ship shall in any event be or
become liable for any loss or damage to or in connection with the
transportation of goods in an amount exceeding $500 per package lawful money of
the United States, or in case of goods not shipped in packages, per customary
freight unit or the equivalent of that sum in other currency, unless the nature
and value of such goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and
inserted in bill of lading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
declaration if embodied in the bill of lading shall be prima facie evidence,
but shall be conclusive on the carrier.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By agreement between the carrier, master or agent of the
carrier, and the shipper another maximum amount than that mentioned in this
paragraph may be fixed:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pro­vided, That
such maximum shall not be less than the figure above named. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In no event shall the carrier liable for more
than the amount of damage actually sustained."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 1749 of the New Civil Code also allows the limitations of
liability in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1749.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
stipulation that the common carrier's liability is limited to the value of the
goods appearing in the bill of lading, unless the shipper or owner de­clares a
greater value, is binding."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the Civil Code does not of itself limit
the liability of the common carrier to a fixed amount per package although the
Code expressly permits a stipulation limiting such liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the COGSA, which is <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span>
to the provisions of the Civil Code, steps in and supplements the Code by
establishing a statutory provision limiting the carrier's liability in the
absence of a declaration of a higher value of the goods by the shipper in the
bill of lading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provisions of the
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act on limited liability are as much a part of a bill
of lading as though physically in it and as much a part thereof as though
placed therein by agreement of the parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>G.R. No. 69044</u>, there is no stipulation in the
respective Bills of Lading (Exhibits "C-2" and "I-3")<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
limiting the carrier's liability for the loss or destruction of the goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there a declaration of a higher value
of the goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Petitioner
Carrier's liability should not exceed US$500 per package, or its peso
equivalent, at the time of payment of the value of the goods lost, but in no
case "more than the amount of damage actually sustained."</p>

<p class="BODY">The actual total loss for the 5,000 pieces of <span class="SpellE">calorized</span>
lance pipes was P256,039 (Exhibit "C"), which was exactly the amount
of the insurance coverage by Development Insurance (Exhibit "A"), and
the amount affirmed to be paid by respond­ent Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The goods were shipped in 28 packages
(Exhibit "C-2").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Multiplying
28 packages by $500 would result in a product of $14,000 which, at the current
exchange rate of P20.44 to US$1, would be P286,160, or "more than the
amount of damage actually sustained".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> amount of
P256,039 should be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the seven (7) cases of spare parts (Exhibit
"I-3"), their actual value was P92,361.75 (Exhibit "I"),
which is likewise the insured value of the cargo (Exhi­bit "H") and
which amount was affirmed to be paid by respondent Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, multiplying seven (7) cases by $500
per package at the present prevailing rate of P20.44 to US$1 (US$3,500 x
P20.44) would yield P71,540 only, which is the amount that should be paid by
Petitioner Carrier for those spare parts, and not P92,361.75.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>G.R. No. 71478</u>, in so far as the two (2) cases of
surveying instruments are concerned, the amount awarded to DOWA, which was
already reduced to $1,000 by the Appellate Court following the statutory $500
liability per package, is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the shipment of 128 cartons of garment fabrics in
two (2) containers and insured with NISSHIN, the Appellate Court also limited
Petitioner Carrier's liabi­lity to $500 per package and affirmed the award of
$46,583 to NISSHIN.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It multiplied 128
cartons (considered as COGSA packages) by $500 to arrive at the figure of
$64,000, and explained that "since this amount is more than the insured value
of the goods, that is $46,583, the Trial Court was correct in awarding said
amount only for the 128 cartons, which amount is less than the maximum
limitation of the carrier's liability".</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no reversible error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 128 cartons and not the two (2) containers should be considered as
the shipping unit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. vs. American Export Lines, Inc. 636 F
2d 807 (1981), the consignees of tin ingots and the shipper of floor covering

the Southern District of New York rendered judgment for the plaintiffs, and the

Court of Appeals, Second Division, modified and affirmed holding that:</p>

<blockquote>"When what would ordinarily be considered packages are shipped
in a container supplied by the carrier and the number of such units is
disclosed in the shipping documents, each of those units and not the container
constitutes the 'package' referred to in liability limitation provision of
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carriage
of Goods by Sea Act, § 4(5), 46 U.S.C.A. § 1304(5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Even if language and purposes of Carriage of Goods by Sea Act
left doubt as to whether carrier-furnished containers whose contents are
disclosed should be treated as packages, the interest in securing international
uni­formity would suggest that they should not be so treated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, §4(5), 46

<span class="SpellE">x</span> After quoting the statement in Leather's Best,
supra, 451 F 2d at 815, that treating a container as a package is inconsistent
with the congressional pur­pose of establishing a reasonable minimum level of
lia­bility, Judge <span class="SpellE">Beeks</span> wrote, 414 F. Supp. at 907
(footnotes omitted):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Although this approach has not completely escaped criticism, there
is, nonetheless, much to commend it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
gives needed recognition to the responsibility of the courts to construe and
apply the statute as enacted, however great might be the temptation to 'modernize'
or reconstitute it by artful judicial gloss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If <span class="SpellE">COGSA's</span> package limitation scheme suffers
from internal illness, Congress alone must undertake the surgery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, in this regard, obvious wisdom in
the Ninth Circuit's conclusion in Hartford that techno­logical advancements,
whether or not <span class="SpellE">forseeable</span> by the COGSA promulgators,
do not warrant a dis­tortion or artificial construction of the statu­tory term
'package'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A ruling that these large
reusable metal pieces of transport equipment qualify as COGSA packages - at
least where, as here, they were carrier-owned and supplied - would amount to
just such a distortion.</p>

<p class="2Q">Certainly, if the individual crates or cartons prepared by the
shipper and containing his goods can rightly be considered 'packages' standing
by themselves, they do not suddenly lose that character upon being stowed in a
carrier's con­tainer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I would liken
these containers to detachable stowage compartments of the ship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They simply serve to divide the ship's
overall cargo stowage space into smaller, more serviceable loci.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shippers' packages are quite literally
'stowed' in the containers utilizing stevedoring practices and materials
analogous to those employed in traditional on board stowage.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the Bill of Lading (Exhibit "A")
disclosed the following data:</p>

<blockquote>" 2 Containers</blockquote>

<blockquote>" (128 Cartons)</blockquote>

<blockquote>==========</blockquote>

<blockquote>" Men's Garments Fabrics and Accessories Freight Prepaid</blockquote>

<blockquote>" Say:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two (2)
Containers Only."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Considering, therefore, that the Bill of
Lading clearly disclosed the contents of the containers, the number of cartons
or units, as well as the nature of the goods, and applying the ruling in the <u>Mitsui</u>
and <span class="SpellE"><u>Eurygenes</u></span> cases it is clear that the 128
cartons, not the two (2) containers should be considered as the shipping unit
subject to the $500 limi­tation of liability.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, the evidence does not disclose whether the containers
involved herein were carrier-furnished or not usually, however, containers are
provided by the carrier.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the probability is that they were so furnished for Petitioner
Carrier was at liberty to pack and carry the goods in containers if they were
not so packed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, at the dorsal side
of the Bill of Lading (Exhibit "A") appears the following stipulation
in fine print:</p>

<blockquote>"11.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Use of Container)
Where the goods receipt of which is acknowledged on the face of this Bill of
Lading are not already packed into container(s) at the time of receipt, the
Carrier shall be at liberty to pack and carry them in any type of
container(s)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing would explain the use of the estimate "<u>Say</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two (2) Containers Only" in the Bill of
Lading, meaning that the goods could probably fit in two (2) con­tainers
only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot mean that the shipper
had furnished the containers for if so, "Two (2) Containers"
appearing as the first entry would have sufficed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And if there is any ambiguity in the Bill of
Lading, it is a cardinal principle in the construction of contracts that the
interpretation of obscure words or stipulations in a contract shall not favor
the party who caused the obscurity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
This applies with even greater force in a contract of adhesion where a contract
is already prepared and the other party merely adhere to it, like the Bill of
Lading in this case, which is drawn up by the carrier.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">YAP, <i>J</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">.:</span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to G.R. No. 71478, the majority opinion holds that
the 128 cartons of textile materials, and not the two (2) containers, should be
considered as the shipping unit for the purpose of applying the $500.00
limitation under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA).</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion followed and applied the interpretation of
the COGSA "package" limitation adopted by the Second Circuit, United
States Court of Appeals, in Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. vs. American Export Lines,
Inc., 636 F 2d 807 (1981) and the Smithgreyhound v. M/V Eurygenes, 666, F 2d,
746.  Both cases adopted the rule that
carrier-furnished containers whose contents are fully disclosed are not
"packages" within the meaning of Section 4 (5) of COGSA.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot go along with the majority in applying the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mitsui</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>and <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Eurygenes</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>decisions to the present case, for
the following reasons:  (1) The facts in
those cases differ materially from those obtaining in the present case; and (2)
the rule laid down in those two cases is by no means settled doctrine.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mitsui</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>and <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Eurygenes</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>the
containers were supplied by the carrier or shipping company.  In <u>Mitsui</u>,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;color:red"> </span>the Court held:  "Certainly, if the individual crates or cartons prepared by the
shipper and containing his goods can rightly be considered 'packages' standing
by them­selves, they do not suddenly lose that character upon being stowed in a
carrier's container.  I would liken
these containers to detachable stowage compartments of the ship." Cartons
or crates placed inside carrier-furnished containers are deemed stowed in the
vessel itself, and do not lose their character as individual units simply by
being placed inside containers provided by the carrier, which are merely
"detachable stowage compartments of the ship".</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is
</span>no evidence showing that the two containers in question were
carrier-supplied.  This fact cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">be </span>presumed.  The facts of the case in fact show that this was the only
shipment placed in containers.  The
other shipment involved in the case, consisting of surveying instruments, was
packed in two "cases".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We
</span>cannot speculate on the meaning of the words "Say:  Two (2) Containers Only", which appear
in the bill of lading.  Absent any
positive evidence on this point, we cannot say that those words constitute a
mere estimate that the shipment could fit in two containers, thereby showing
that when the goods were delivered by the shipper, they were not yet placed
inside the con­tainers and that it was the petitioner carrier which packed the
goods into its own containers, as authorized under paragraph 11 on the dorsal
side of the bill of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">lading, </span>Exhib<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">i</span>t A.  Such assumption cannot be made in view of the following words clearly
stamped in red ink on the face of the bill of lading:  "Shipper's Load, Count and Seal Said to Contain".  This clearly indicates <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">that it was the </span>shipper which loaded
and counted the goods placed inside the container and sealed the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two containers were delivered by the shipper to the carrier
already sealed for shipment, and the number of cartons said to be contained
inside them was indicated in the bill of lading, on the mere say-so of the
shipper.  The freight paid to the
carrier or the ship­ment was based on the measurement (by volume) of the two
containers at $34.50 per cubic meter.  The shipper must have saved on the freight charges by using containers
for the shipment.  Under the
circumstances, it would be unfair to the carrier to have the limitation of its
liability under COGSA fixed on the number <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of
</span>cartons inside the containers, rather than on the containers themselves,
since the freight revenue was based on the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mitsui</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>and <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Eurygenes</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>decisions
are not the last word on the subject.  The interpretation of the COGSA package limitation is in a state of
flux,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
as the courts continue to wrestle with the troublesome problem of applying the
statutory limitation under COGSA to containerized shipments.  The law was adopted before modern
technological changes have revolutionized the shipping industry.  There is need for the law it­self to be
updated to meet the changes brought about by the container revolution, but this
is a task which should be addressed by the legislative body.  Until then, this Court, while mindful of
American jurispru­dence on the subject, should make its own interpreta­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">tion of </span>the COGSA provisions,
consistent with what is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">equitable to
the parties concerned.  There is need to
balance the interests of the shipper and those of the carrier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the shipper opted to ship the goods in two
containers, and paid freight charges based on the freight unit, i.e., cubic
meters.  The shipper did not declare the
value of the shipment, for that would have entailed higher freight-charges; ins­tead
of paying higher freight charges, the shipper protected itself by insuring the
shipment.  As subrogee, the insurance
company can recover from the carrier only what the shipper itself is entitled
to recover, not the amount it actually paid the shipper under the insurance
policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our view, under the circumstances, the container should be
regarded as the shipping unit or "package" within the purview of
COGSA.  However, we realize that this
may not be equitable as far as the shipper is con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">cerned.  If the container is not
regarded as a "package" within the terms of COGSA, then, the $500.00
liability limitation should be based on "the customary freight unit".  Sec. 4 (5) of COGSA provides that in case of
goods not shipped in packages, the limit of the carrier's liability shall be
$500.00 "per customary freight unit." In the case at bar, the
petitioner's liability for the shipment in question based on "freight
unit" would be $21,950.00 for the shipment of 43.9 cubic meters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">I concur with the rest of
the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
