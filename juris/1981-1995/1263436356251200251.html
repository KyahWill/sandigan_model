Cavite.  The case was docketed as

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution was carefully summarized by the
trial court in its decision, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The people's version of the case is that on February 23, 1979
complainant Gloria Dalin (Dalin, for short), together with five (5) companions,
went to a 'manggahan' at Bangkal, Carmona, Cavite to rest and at the same time
pick mangoes.  While thus picking
mangoes, accused and a young male companion -- about ten (10) years old --
arrived.  Frightened by this sudden
appearance, Dalin and her companions scampered away in different
directions.  Accused shouted at them to
come back which, Dalin and her companions, due to fear, heeded.  And return, they did.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On order of the accused, Dalin and Ruby Laurente were tied together
to a hanging branch of a mango tree with banana fiber locally called
'saha'.  The other members of the group
were also tied with the same fiber but separately.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After a while, accused directed those tied separately to play a
racing game promising the one to reach him first to be set free.  Thus, they were untied for this purpose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While the game was in progress, Dalin and Ruby were busy trying to
free themselves and since the 'saha' was fresh and slippery, they
succeeded.  Thus freed, they ran towards
the river.  Accused who chased them was
able to overtake Dalin.  Ruby, on the
other hand, proceeded home and reported the matter to Dalin's mother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused pulled Dalin by the hair in dragging her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>a hut where he forcibly removed
Dalin's short pants.  Thereafter, he
used earthen pots -- which broke one after the other due to the force of the
impact -- ­to prop up the buttocks of Dalin for easy sexual penetration.  Accused succeeded having coition with Dalin
four (4) times.  Accused desisted only
upon the entreaties of his young male companion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Taking advantage of the lull, Dalin rushed home.  On the way, she met her mother who was
already looking for her as a result of the report of Ruby.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Immediately, Dalin and her mother went to a PC Detachment in the
area and reported the rape done to her by the accused.  The PC authorities, however, directed them
to proceed instead to the police station of Carmona, Cavite which they
did.  The necessary investigation was
done therein.  Thereafter, Dalin was
brought to the PC Crime Laboratory at Camp Crame for medical examination.  As it was already quite late in the evening,
and there being no physician available at that date and time, the medical
examination was conducted the following day -- February 24, 1979 -- at about
10:30 in the morning.  The doctor, Dr.

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We agree with the
respondents and the trial court that the petitioner was not denied the right to
cross-examine the offended </span>party.  He was given ample and sufficient time to do so.  His counsel, Atty. Loyola, could have
conducted the cross-examination on 8 March 1984 immediately after the
termination of the direct examination but did not allegedly because he was not
ready.  Counsel then spent two court
sessions (9 July and 11 July 1984) cross-examining the private complainant.  On 9 July 1984, Atty. Loyola cross-examined
her for one hour, and when he was asked by the court if he was through with the
witness, he replied: "I think, I need one more hearing.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>On 11 July 1984, Atty.

which was later stopped because the private complainant became indisposed.  Nevertheless, although the prosecution had
announced that it was ready for the continuation of the cross-examination on
the following day, Atty. Loyola told the court that he would be at the
Sandiganbayan and suggested that the continuation be had on 20 August
1984.  When the prosecuting fiscal
informed Atty. Loyola that the offended party would leave the country and might
not be able to return to the Philippines, the following exchange transpired:</p>

<blockquote>"Atty. Loyola -?</blockquote>

<blockquote>According to the
witness, she will be returning.  Because
she cannot answer, what will happen to the witness if we force her to testify?
We do not want to force her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fiscal Gervacio --</blockquote>

<blockquote>She is available
tomorrow.</blockquote>

this.  If she is not around on the 20th
we will proceed with another witness."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This clearly shows that Atty. Loyola was fully aware that the
private complainant was scheduled to leave the Philippines, and that if she
should be unavailable for the continuation of the cross-examination, he was
willing to forego further cross-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">e</span>xamination
and present another witness.  Even if
this were farthest from his mind, we are further convinced that, knowing of the
expected departure of the private complainant, Atty. Loyola <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">wanted a scenario wherein the private
complainant either would be unable to testify or could no longer be
cross-examined -- in which case he would move that her testimony be stricken
out from the record.  This is easily
borne out by the counsel's dilatory </span>tactics -- <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">he neither cross-examined her on 8 March 1984 nor agreed that the
cross-examination be continued on 12 July 1984.  He also deliberately dragged out his cross-examination on 9 July
and 11 July 1984.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tribunal may have before it the deportment and appearance of the witness while
testifying.  But the latter purpose is
so much a subordinate and incidental one that no vital importance is attached

fundamental right which is part of due process.  However, the right is a personal one which may be waived

cross-examination.  Thus, where a party
has had the opportunity to cross-examine a witness but failed to avail himself
