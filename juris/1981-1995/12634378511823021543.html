				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">One man's bestiality is another's misfortune.  This best exemplifies the instant case
involving the sexual defilement of Jackie Lemon Lazaga, a six (6) year old
child, by herein accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around four o'clock in the afternoon of July 29, 1991, Jackie
Lemon Lazaga, then only six (6) years old, was asleep in her parents' bedroom
located on the second floor of the St. Vincent Medical Clinic at Cagba,
Masbate, Masbate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jackie suddenly awoke to find the accused Ruben Repollo, their
houseboy, beside her.  The accused
removed her panty and likewise disrobed himself of his short pants.  He placed his hand on Jackie's private part
and then inserted his penis into her vagina.  As she felt the pain, she cried out in agony and protest but she stopped
when the accused frightened her to silence.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Paquita Lazaga, Jackie's aunt and foster mother,
arrived from the store and asked <span style="">for </span>her.  She was told that the child was upstairs
studying.  She proceeded to Jackie's
room but did not find her.  She went
directly to their room but found the door locked.  When she knocked, she got no response, thus, prompting her to get
a chair and peek through a window.  She
saw Jackie, pale and perspiring, putting on her panty.  Accused was with her in the room.  When the accused opened the door, she asked
him what he did to Jackie but the latter uttered no reply.  When she entered the room, Paquita found
semen on their bed and on Jackie's private part.  Paquita washed Jackie and notified her husband of the
incident.  Jackie was brought to the
hospital for medical examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> At
the Masbate Provincial Hospital, she was examined by Dr. Anthony Clores.  The examination revealed hymenal laceration
at two o'clock and nine o'clock positions and erythema on the right labia
majora.  Speculum examination yielded
negative results.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moments later, the accused was arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1991, Ruben Repollo was charged with rape.  The indictment reads:</p>

<blockquote>That on or about July 29, 1991 in the afternoon thereof at Sitio
Cagba, Barangay Tugbo, Municipality of Masbate, Province of Masbate,
Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named
accused, did then and there, by means of force and intimidation willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with one JACKIE LAZAGA, a Six
(6) year old child, against her will and without her consent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Committed with the aggravating circumstance of Grave Abuse of
confidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon his arraignment on January 17, 1992 with the assistance of
counsel, accused pleaded not guilty to the charge against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court thereafter set and conducted the trial of the case on the
merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">In time, the court <i>a quo</i> rendered judgment, the decretal
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused Ruben
Repollo guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and hereby
sentences him to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the
offended party, Jackie Lemon Lazaga the sum of P30,000.00 as moral damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It appearing that accused Repollo is detained, in the service of
his sentence, he shall be credited the full period of his detention.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">SO ORDERED.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, accused-appellant insists that the trial court
committed a grave error in according more credibility and weight to the
testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution, particularly the testimony of
the victim herself, Jackie Lemon Lazaga, than to the version of the
defense.  He reiterates his defense of
alibi and in the alternative, contends that the victim failed to offer
resistance, hence the act was not vitiated by force and intimidation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful and thorough review of the records, we are fully
convinced of the untenability of the theory of the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule, rape is committed against a woman only if carnal
knowledge of her is done either by using force or intimidation, or when she is
deprived of reason or is otherwise unconscious.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
However, when the offended party is a woman under twelve years of age, the mere
fact of sexual intercourse with her constitutes said crime.  This is known in legal jargon as statutory
rape defined under Article 335(3) of the Revised Penal Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The gravamen of statutory rape is the carnal knowledge of a woman
under twelve years of age.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Violence, force or intimidation is not required.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> In
the case at bench, it is beyond dispute that Jackie Lemon Lazaga was six (6)
years old when she was raped, hence, proof of use of force or intimidation
against her is not necessary to establish the guilt of accused-appellant.  Therefore, a mere showing that he had carnal
knowledge of Jackie on the specified date would justify his conviction.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As in most criminal cases, the issue here revolves on the trial
court's appreciation of the testimonies proffered before it.  In this case, the court <i>a </i><i><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>gave more weight and credence to the declarations of the
witnesses for the prosecution.  Said
findings must be respected as it is axiomatic that findings of trial courts on
credibility of witnesses are given great weight and accorded high respect by
appellate courts, given the natural advantage that a trial judge has in the
appreciation of such evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the victim was only six years old at the time
of the rape.  At such a young age, she
could not be expected to fabricate such a complicated tale as sexual defilement
unless she experienced the same.  Records show that she spontaneously narrated her ordeal to her foster
mother, and ultimately to the court.  Her declaration characterized by spontaneity, brevity and clarity
reveals:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  While you were sleeping at the room of your parents at Cagba, Masbate,
Masbate, Ruben Reppolo (sic) got inside that room and closed the door?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Short

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
removing your panty what did he do with his short pants?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Will you tell us what did this Ruben

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ruben
Repollo placed his hand on my private part.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
about him, what did he do with his private part?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
placed his penis to my vagina.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did you do when he placed his penis to your vagina?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
cried.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
when he placed his penis on your vagina did he tell you anything?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did he tell you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I made a noise he told me to stop.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
did you stop?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
I was afraid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
Ruben Repollo placed his penis in your private part, what did you feel, if any?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
is painful.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from the foregoing that Jackie Lemon Lazaga clearly
and unequivocally testified that she felt pain when accused-appellant forced
his penis into her genitals.  Her
narration before the court of when and how the accused-appellant did it was so
clear and convincing as to leave any doubt that hers was not a contrived or
false story.  Verily, the court <i>a </i><i><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>was correct in believing her.  Courts usually lend credence to testimonies of young girls, especially
where the established facts indubitably point to their having been sexually
assaulted.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, it is inconceivable that a young girl would invent such a sordid tale
as her being defiled by accused-appellant unless it was the plain truth.  Time and again, this Court has held that
when an alleged victim of rape says that she was violated, she says in effect
all that is necessary to show that rape has been inflicted on her and so long
as her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused-appellant may be
convicted on the basis thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> In
addition, it is clear that the charge was not motivated by any grudge, malice
or ill-will against Repollo, who apparently had treated Jackie well until that
fateful day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, the accused-appellant reiterates his defense of
alibi and denial.  He claims that Dr.
Ricardo Lazaga, foster father of the child, caused his arrest on account of a
broken pail and to avoid payment of his wages.  Accused-appellant's audacity and effrontery shock and annoy this
Court.  It is hard to imagine that
parents would stamp their child with the stigma of rape<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
just to avoid paying the wages of a houseboy and to get even with him for a
broken pail.  Accused-appellant's
defense must likewise fail, not only because it is incredible and inherently
weak but also because it is totally unsubstantiated as he failed to rebut the
positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.  His bare denial of culpability and self-serving assertion that he
was not at the place of incident at the time the crime was committed do not
inspire the slightest belief and consideration in view of his clear and
positive identification by the victim and the other prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that the trial court did not commit <span style="">a </span>reversible error in convicting the
accused.  However, in view of the
Court's policy with regard to the amount of indemnity that may be awarded in
rape cases of this nature, the indemnification to the victim and her family
should be increased to P50,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="">, </span>the judgment convicting
accused-appellant of the crime of rape is hereby <span style="">AFFIRMED, </span>with the <span style="">MODIFICATION
</span>that said accused-appellant is hereby ordered to pay the victim and her
family the amount of P50,000.00 as and by way of indemnification.</p>
