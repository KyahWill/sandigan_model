				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue in this case is whether or not the trial court
committed grave abuse of discretion in ordering the partial lifting of a writ
of preliminary attachment and in granting <i>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></i>
the release of respondents' marginal deposit of P197,722.94.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 March 1980, petitioner filed with the respondent trial court
a complaint for a sum of money, with an application for a writ of preliminary
attachment against the private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its principal causes of action involve a promissory note of
P2,270,000.00 and domestic letters of credit in the amounts of (a) P540,000.00
covering the purchase of lumber, furniture and <span class="SpellE"><i>kotatsu</i></span>
(sic) from the OESCO Timber Co., (b) P600,000.00 covering the purchase of <span class="SpellE">narra</span> lumber from the OESCO Timber Co. and (c) P300,000.00
covering the purchase of red <span class="SpellE">lauan</span> and <span class="SpellE">tanguile</span> lumber from the R. <span class="SpellE">Syquian</span>
Sawmill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with said letters
of credit, private respondent G.M. Wood Export Industries, Inc., hereinafter
referred to as G.M. Wood, through its President and General Manager, private
respondent Gonzales, signed and delivered to the petitioner the corresponding
documents of trust.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 7928-P.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court issued a writ of preliminary attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on 24 April 1980, petitioner and
private respondents filed a Joint Motion containing stipulations regarding a
temporary arrangement between them under which G.M. Wood was allowed to
continue with its business operations without, however, prejudicing or
jeopardizing petitioner’s interest in the attached or garnished properties of
G.M. Wood; the said motion provides:</p>

<blockquote>"a.<span style=""> </span>That the writ of attachment is not hereby
lifted x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and the
attachment/garnishment /levy on the properties of defendant shall subsists
(sic)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The motion also mentions that by virtue
of the writ, G.M. Wood's machineries, office equipment and finished and
unfinished wood products in its factory were levied upon and garnishment was
made upon major banks in Metro Manila on private respondents' money.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 April 1980, the trial court approved the joint motion but
lifted partially the attachment levied on private respondents' properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 May 1980, petitioner filed an omnibus motion praying, among
others, for:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the reconsideration of
the above order insofar as it mandated the partial lifting of the writ of
attachment and (b) the total reinstatement of the attachment on the properties.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The hearing for this motion was postponed three (3) times at the instance of
private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the third time;
the hearing was again postponed to 15 August 1980, but on this date, private
respondents did not appear; petitioner then verbally moved for the submission
of the motion for resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The formal
motion to this effect was likewise filed. <a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court did not act thereon; instead, on 29 January 1981, it issued an
Order<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
granting private respondents' urgent motion for the release to private
respondent Gonzales of the marginal deposit of P197,722.94.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was not furnished with a copy of
the motion, which does not even contain the required notice of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner thus filed a motion for
reconsideration<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
which the trial court denied in its Order of 11 February 1981.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court likewise denied on 16 February 1981 petitioner's
motion to reconsider the 29 April 1980 Order.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed with the Court of Appeals a special civil
action for <i>certiorari</i> to set aside the Orders of 29 January 1981 and 11
February 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was
docketed as C.A.-G.R. No. 12078.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
its receipt of the 16 February 1981 Order, petitioner filed a supplemental
petition to set it aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's
main thesis is that these orders were issued with grave abuse of discretion and
should therefore be declared null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of 30 September 1981,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition based on the following
grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the said court failed
to note or discern a single document of the various documents which petitioner
alleged to have been executed by private respondents authorizing the petitioner
to charge or debit any present or future balance of any and/or deposit accounts
of the latter with the former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
it cannot uphold the theory of petitioner that marginal deposits are not really
deposits but are considered collateral security, for if this were so, "it
becomes a paradox that petitioner would still make mention of certain and
various documents which private respondents allegedly executed in favor of
petitioner bank authorizing the latter to charge or debit any present or future
balance of any and/or deposit accounts of the private respondents with the
petitioner bank." Thirdly, as to the grievance that due process was
violated by the <i>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></i> issuance of the 29
January 1981 Order, the same is unfounded because when petitioner filed a
motion for reconsideration, he was afforded a full-blown hearing on 11 February
1981; thus, due process was sufficiently observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the application of the due process
requirement, what is sought to be safeguarded is not lack of notice but the
denial of opportunity to be heard.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion to reconsider the aforesaid decision was
denied by the Court of Appeals in its resolution of 5 April 1982 wherein it
ruled that the private respondents did not receive the amount of P2,270,000.00
as mentioned in the promissory note dated 30 August 1979; considering that this
is the only possible account to which any fund or deposit of private
respondents may be applied, the marginal deposit cannot, therefore, be applied
to it since private respondents are not even liable on the note.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition wherein petitioner submits the following
issues for consideration:</p>

<blockquote>"CAN THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS OR A COURT OF FIRST
INSTANCE ORDER THE DELIVERY OF THE PROPERTY OF A PARTY LITIGANT TO THE ADVERSE
PARTY, WHICH PROPERTY IS NOT THE OBJECT OF LITIGATION, AND DO SO -- A) WITHOUT
SERVICE OF THE MOTION, BASIS OF THE ORDER; B) WITHOUT HEARING; C) WITHOUT
SERVICE OF SAID ORDER TO COUNSEL; AND WITHOUT RECOURSE TO OTHER REMEDY, I.E.,
REQUIRING IMMEDIATE COMPLIANCE?</blockquote>

<blockquote>CAN THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS MAKE FINDINGS OF FACTS WITHOUT
PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE?”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After private respondents filed their Comment, this Court gave
due course to the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
the parties filed their respective Briefs.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully examined the pleadings and We agree with the
petitioner that the marginal deposit of P197,722.94 is not involved in Civil
Case No. 7928-P.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not denied by
private respondents that this marginal deposit is in connection with their <u>importation</u>
<u>of</u> <u>machineries</u> <u>for</u> <u>which</u> <u>they</u> <u>obtained</u>
letters of credit from petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The marginal deposit requirement is a Central Bank measure to cut
off excess currency liquidity which would create inflationary pressure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a collateral security given by the
debtor, and is supposed to be returned to him upon his compliance with his
secured obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
bank pays no interest on the marginal deposit, unlike an ordinary bank deposit
which earns interest in the bank."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">None of the causes of action in the complaint, earlier alluded
to, involve any liability on the part of the private respondents arising from
the importation of machineries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no showing that it is the subject of a counterclaim in the respondents' Answer
with the end in view of recovering its deposit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents assert, however, that the marginal deposit was
litigated upon in the case because it was among the properties included in
either the attachment order of 7 March 1980 or the modified attachment order of
29 April 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first order is
all-embracing as it covers all kinds of properties belonging to the
respondents, including the marginal deposit.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
This assertion is clearly without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mere fact that an attachment order is issued does not mean that the
defendant's property is automatically seized.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise stated, an attachment order is not self-<span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must first be a levy on or garnishment
of the property to be made by the sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This levy or garnishment is the operative act that brings the property
in <span class="SpellE"><i>custodia</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">legis</span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court
provides for the manner of attachment of property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the sheriff certified
that no levy or garnishment was made against private respondents' property in
the possession of petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the trial court acquired no jurisdiction over the marginal
deposit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, since by its very
nature the marginal deposit is already in the possession of the petitioner as
collateral security in a transaction private respondents entered into in
connection with the importation of machineries - which cannot be validly
released to the latter until the satisfaction of the principal obligation --
its attachment for the benefit of petitioner would be unnecessary unless, in
the meantime, the private respondents had settled the principal
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such settlement is a factual
issue which is not raised in the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court then acted without jurisdiction or with grave
abuse of discretion when it ordered the petitioner to release the marginal
deposit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more reprehensible in
the conduct of the trial court is its deliberate failure to act with dispatch
on petitioner's motion to reconsider both the Order of 29 April 1980 insofar as
it partially lifted the writ of attachment and the approval, <i>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></i>, of the motion to release the marginal
deposit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, of course, merit in
the first motion as the trial court acted rather capriciously when it partially
lifted the writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the parties
asked for such lifting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
in their joint motion, they explicitly agreed "a.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the writ of attachment is not hereby
lifted by virtue of this temporary arrangement and the
attachment/garnishment/levy on the properties of defendant shall subsists
(sic).”<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
As to the motion for release, We note from the Order dated 29 January 1981 that
it is denominated as <u>urgent</u> and was filed only on 28 January 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents do not deny the fact that no copy
thereof was furnished the petitioner; they also do not dispute the fact that no
notice of its hearing was indicated in the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">movants</span> then
deliberately violated the requirement of notice prescribed in Sections 4 and 5,
Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
requirement is <u>mandatory</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion that does not contain a notice of hearing is a mere scrap of paper; it
presents no question which merits the attention and consideration of the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not even a motion for it does not
comply with the rules and the clerk of court has no right to receive it.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Being a mere scrap of paper, the trial court had no other alternative but to
disregard it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the motion
contained a notice, still the trial court could not have validly acted on it
for, as of the date it acted thereon, no proof of service of the notice on
petitioner was shown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 6 of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> Rule provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"No motion shall be acted upon by the court, without proof of
service of the notice thereof, except when the court is satisfied that the
rights of the adverse party or parties are not affected."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the right of the petitioner was definitely
affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petitioner subsequently
filed a motion to reconsider and that it underwent a full-blown hearing did
not, contrary to the postulation of the Court of Appeals, cure the fatal error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing disquisitions render unnecessary the second issue
raised in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the respondent Court of 30
September 1981 and its resolution of 5 April 1982 in C.A.-G.R. No. 12078 and
the Orders of the trial court of 29 January 1981 and 11 February 1981 in Civil
Case No. 7928-P are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The partial lifting of the writ of attachment
