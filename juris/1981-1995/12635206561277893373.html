Alexander M. de la <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span> of "the complex

A) <span class="GramE">wherein</span> he admitted the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The confession is admissible under section </span>20,
Article IV of the Constitution because he ratified it while he was on the

two killings were attended with treachery which absorbs <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were correctly categorized as

state that he killed the victims when they were awake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The accused supplied the
evidence on evident premeditation when in his testimony he declared that he had

Imelda because she was the victim of a sudden and unexpected assault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had reason to feel safe after she had

and dwelling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plea of guilty and voluntary surrender to the authorities are
admittedly mitigating, but passion and obfuscation cannot be considered
extenuating because the accused acted in a spirit of unmitigated
lawlessness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the act producing
the obfuscation must not be far removed from the commission of the crime by a
considerable length of time (People vs. Hernandez, 43 Phil. 104; People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Alanguilang</span>,

<p class="BODY">Considering the attending circumstances, <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> is the proper penalty for each murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the <u>attempted murder</u>, the proper
penalty, after giving the accused the benefit of two mitigating circumstances
without any generic aggravating circumstance (Art. 64[5], Revised Penal Code),
is six months of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Dumapig</span>, 51, widower,
