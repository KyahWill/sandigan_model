the claims for unpaid wages and allowances:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that it was not liable to pay, on across-the-board basis, the P1.00 per
day increase in the statutory minimum wage granted under Wage Order No. 2; that
it had already complied with the P1.00 (as of July 6, 1983) and P1.50 (as of
October 1, 1983) increase in the living allowances mandated by the same wage;
and that it was not required by the Occupational Safety and Health Standard to
provide its workers and premises with the safety equipments mentioned in the

provided therein to be mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corrollarily</span>, while admitting that the P1.50 and P1.00
additional daily allowances set by the Order were paid to petitioner's

allegedly pursuant to the Order when the same nowhere provides <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>The public respondent
committed grave abuse of discretion in arbitrarily mandating the installation

legal basis <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, thereby denying petitioner's
constitutional right to due process and the equal protection of the laws.</blockquote>

Incorporated vs. the Secretary of Labor and Employment, (G.R. No. 85840, June
5, 1991, 198 SCRA 156) reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span> Shipping
Corporation vs. de la Serna, (G.R. No. 88538, July 25, 1991, 199 SCRA 568) is
controlling in the present case, particularly on the issue of jurisdictions of
Labor Arbiters and Regional Directors over money claims of employees against
employers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these said cases, the Court
ruled that the original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide
employee's money claims arising from employer-employee relations exceeding the
aggregate amount of P5,000 for <u>each</u> employee is vested in the Labor
Arbiter (Art. 217 (a), (b), Labor Code as amended) and this is confirmed by the
provisions of Art. 129 of the same Code, which excludes from the jurisdiction
of the Regional Director or any hearing officer of the Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE) the power to hear and decide claims of employees arising from
employer-employee relations exceeding the amount of P5,000.00 for <u>each</u>
employee.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">In the case at bar, the aggregate claim
of the workers is P106,027.87, but the claim of each of the more than thirty
(30) workers does not exceed P5,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This being the case, the jurisdiction to decide the claim properly
belongs to the Regional Director.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only instance when the Regional Director may be divested of such jurisdiction
is when under Art. 128 (b) of the Labor Code, the following three (3)
circumstances concur, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the petitioner
(employer) contests the findings of the labor regulations officer and raises
issues thereon;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that in order to resolve
such issue, there is a need to examine evidentiary matters; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that such matters are not verifiable in the
normal course of inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(SSK Parts
Corp. v. Camas, G.R. No. 85934, Jan. 30, 1990, 181 SCRA 675)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Regional Director required the payment of petitioner of a one
peso (P1.00) across-the-board increase to its employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contended that in so doing, the
Regional Director misinterpreted and misapplied Wage Order No. 2 because even
before the passage of the said order, the minimum wage obtaining in
petitioner's company was already more than the minimum wage level set by Wage
Order No. 2.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of living allowances, it is admitted that the
petitioner did actually give the required P1.50 and P1.00 cost of living
allowance provided for by Wage Order No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the Regional Director maintains, however, is that since the total
amount of allowances is less by P0.60 if we compare the same with the aggregate
sum of allowance provided for by the various Presidential issuances, the proper
implementation of Wage Order No. 2 must require petitioner to grant the
difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its part, petitioner
argues that what the Wage Order mandates is the grant of an additional P1.50
and P1.00 daily in living allowances effective July 6, 1983 and October 1,
1983, respectively, and nothing more.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment to the Petition, the Solicitor General opined that
the Regional Director and public respondent have no jurisdiction over the
subject money claims since petitioner contests the findings of the Labor
Standard Inspectors and presents intricate questions of law (p. 12, Comment; p.
95, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case before Us clearly falls within the
exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 128 (b) of the Labor
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue presented by petitioner
- how Wage Order No. 2 should be interpreted and applied, will necessitate the
examination of evidentiary matters not verifiable in the normal course of
inspection.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, however, sustain the action of the Regional Director and the
public respondent in ordering petitioner to provide the safety equipment and
paraphernalia mentioned in the report of the labor inspectors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of petitioner that there was no finding by the
labor inspectors or the Assistant Regional Director as to the hazardous nature
of its business is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The labor inspectors conducted an on-the-spot inspection of the
premises of petitioner and actually discovered that various safety equipment as
enumerated in their report are wanting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This implies that the workers are exposed to hazards necessitating the
installation of those equipment and paraphernalia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is within the scope of the <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement power of the MOLE under Sec. 1,
Rule X, Book III of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code as
well as Policy Instruction No. 6.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed Order is SET ASIDE in so far as it
makes an award for alleged deficiency in wages and allowances, the Regional
Director not having jurisdiction to make the same, but AFFIRMED insofar as it
requires installation or provision of health and safety devices in petitioner's
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim for deficiency in
wages and allowances is REFERRED to the Labor Arbiter for proper proceedings.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
