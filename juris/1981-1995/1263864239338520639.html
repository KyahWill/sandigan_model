Court of Appeals, per its Resolution, dated <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not <i>certiorari</i>
and/or <i>mandamus</i> will lie:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) in
the absence of statements in the petition establishing and proving with
certainty that there is no appeal nor plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Visca</span> (hereafter VISCA), upon discovering that the
homestead application of one Leon Reyes (H.A. No. 9893) allegedly approved on </span><st1:date year="1948" day="4" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 4, 1948</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, under Entry No.</span> V-9119, had adversely covered about 24
hectares of the western portion of his 50-hectare land, filed a protest with
the Bureau of Lands on May 28, 1962, claiming that said homestead application
is illegal and unlawful (1) because the land covered thereby is marshy and
swampy and suitable only for fishpond purposes and should be disposed of only
through sale or lease; and 2) for abandonment and non-compliance with the
cultivation requirement of the Public Land Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1969</st1:date>,
he filed a supplemental protest, based on the dummy relationship between the
private respondent herein, <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> Fernando, and
one <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> <span class="SpellE">Panopio</span>, the
person really interested <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>the
land covered by the homestead application of Leon Reyes (CA Resolution, pp.
28-29, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands dismissed the protest for want of valid and
legal ground on <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">VISCA's</span>
"Motion for Reconsideration" was likewise denied on <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order of dismissal was affirmed by the
Secretary of Agriculture on <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="3">March 9,

reconsideration was denied on <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="4">April
 28, 1971</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">VISCA filed a direct suit for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
with the then CFI of <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> to:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) annul the orders of the Director of Lands
and the Decision of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources and 2)
direct the Director of Lands a) to cancel HA 9893 (E.V. 9119), Leon Reyes’
homestead application, and b) to give due course to his Sales Application over
the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Public respondents Director of Lands and the
Secretary of Agriculture filed separate answers, both of which contain special
and affirmative defenses, among which is that VISCA has not exhausted the
administrative remedies, for not appealing to the Office of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents, on the other hand, filed a motion to dismiss
on the grounds that:</p>

<blockquote>1. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The petition failed to
state a sufficient cause of action for <i>certiorari</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The petitioner failed to
exhaust all his administrative remedies.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court sustained the Motion to Dismiss the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of <span class="GramE">which,</span>
provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"After carefully reviewing the pleadings submitted by the
parties, the court is inclined to sustain the motion to dismiss because
according to the New Rules of Court, the petitioner should establish and drove
(sic) with certainty in the petition that there is no appeal nor any plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and in the case at
bar, the appeal should have been interposed and filed with the President
against the decision rendered by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources." (pp. 30-31, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">)</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon denial of his Motion for Reconsideration, petitioner went to
the Court of Appeals, alleging in his lone assignment of error that:</p>

<blockquote>"The trial court erred in dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> (to review and annul decision of the Director of Lands and
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources) on the grounds that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the petition does not establish and prove
with certainty that there is no appeal nor plain, speedy and adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of law, and (b) petitioner failed to exhaust the
administrative remedy of appeal to the President, despite clear showing in said
petition that the decision of the Director of Lands, affirmed by the decision
of the Secretary, was rendered without any formal hearing whatsoever, <u>whereby</u>
<u>said</u> <u>officials</u> <u>acted</u> <u>with</u> <u>grave</u> <u>abuse</u>
<u>of</u> <u>discretion</u> <u>and/or</u> <u>in</u> <u>excess</u> <u>of</u> <u>their</u>
<u>jurisdiction</u>, <u>and</u> <u>that</u>, <u>appeal</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
<u>President</u> <u>under</u> <u>the</u> <u>circumstances</u> <u>could</u> <u>be</u>
<u>dispensed</u> <u>with</u>" (p. 32, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>;
emphasis ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of whether or not the failure to allege in the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> that there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law is a jurisdictional defect,
it is incumbent upon an applicant for a writ of <i>certiorari</i> to allege
with certainty in his verified petition facts showing that "there is no
appeal, nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law," because this is an indispensable ingredient of a valid petition for <i>certiorari</i>.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>"Being a special civil action,
petitioner-appellant must allege and prove that he has no other speedy and
adequate remedy" (Diego vs. Court of Appeals, et al., 54 O.G. No. 4, 956,
cited in Tan vs. Director of Forestry; 125 SCRA 302, at p. 322).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Where the existence of a remedy by
appeal or some other plain, speedy and adequate remedy precludes the granting
of the writ, the petitioner <u>must</u> <u>allege</u> facts showing that any
existing remedy is impossible or unavailing, <u>or</u> <u>that</u> <u>excuse</u>
<u>petitioner</u> for not having availed himself of such remedy (10 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. <span class="GramE">2d, <i>Certiorari</i>, 811; emphasis
ours).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">A
petition for <i>certiorari</i> which does not comply with the requirements of
the rules may be dismissed" (<span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> Concrete
Products vs. <span class="SpellE">Mogadon</span>, G.R. No. 67706, January 29,
1988).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no record of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed in
the lower court, but on the basis of the trial court's ruling that the
petitioner failed to allege facts to show why appeal to the Office of the
President was no longer necessary in seeking judicial relief, <span class="GramE">then</span> the petition was correctly dismissed on this ground.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">This bring</span> Us to the second issue on
whether petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies when he filed a
direct suit for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule in administrative law is that parties requesting
judicial action must first exhaust their remedies in the executive branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is premised not only on practical
considerations but also on the comity existing between different departments of
the government, which comity requires the court to stay their hands until the
administrative processes have been completed (<span class="SpellE">Madriñan</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sinco</span>, 110 Phil. 160).</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is not
absolute, however.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not applicable
in cases (among many other exceptions) (1) where the question in dispute is
purely a legal one (<span class="SpellE">Tapales</span> vs. President and Board
of Regents of the U.P., L-17523, March 30, 1963); and (2) <u>where</u> <u>the</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>controverted</u></span> <u>act</u> <u>is</u> <u>patently</u>
<u>illegal</u> <u>or</u> <u>was</u> <u>performed</u> <u>without</u> <u>jurisdiction</u>
<u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>excess</u> <u>of</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> or where the
respondent Secretary had acted with <u>grave</u> <u>abuse</u> <u>of</u> <u>discretion</u>
<u>amounting</u> <u>to</u> <u>lack</u> <u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>excess</u> <u>of</u>
<u>jurisdiction</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Osmeña</span>, L-12837,
April 30, 1959, 105 Phil. 1309; <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> vs. Rodriguez,
L-11068, May 27, 1959, 105 Phil. 1323; <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> vs.
Provincial Board, L-11959, Oct. 31, 1959, 106 Phil. 406; Cortes vs. <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>, 100 SCRA 1; Industrial Power Sales Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Duma</span> <span class="SpellE">Sinsuat</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-29171, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 15, 1988</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 160 SCRA 19).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> was prompted by petitioner's belief that both respondent
officials had acted with grave abuse of discretion and/or in excess of
jurisdiction, - i.e., the Director of Lands, in dismissing the protest,
"not on evidence formally introduced" but on "records and reason
alone" (p. 16, Reply Brief, p. 26, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">) </span>and the Secretary of Agriculture, by
his <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
of said Order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he is not
precluded from directly resorting to the courts for redress.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, while the petitioner did not violate the principle on
exhaustion of administrative remedies and is thus not precluded from seeking
immediate judicial relief from the department secretary's orders, his petition
was <span class="SpellE">nontheless</span> defective for failure to comply with
the formal requirements of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>,
Rule 65, Sections 1 and 3, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As stated earlier, therefore, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> correctly
dismissed the petition on this ground.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
dismissing the petition is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
