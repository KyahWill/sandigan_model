<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition alleges that
the petitioner is the absolute owner of several parcels of land with an area of
fifty (50) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> situated at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, included in and covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 37685,
37686, 37678, 37679, 37680 and 37683 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City issued in its name; that the petitioner and its
predecessors have been in continuous possession thereof since 1914 up to the
present; that on April 10, 1953, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch IV, in
Civil Case Nos. Q-135, (<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>,
et al. vs. J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc.), Q-139 (J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. vs. Agustin de Torres), Q-177 (<span class="SpellE">Agripino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> vs. J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc.), and Q-186 (<span class="SpellE">Macaria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> vs. J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc.) rendered a decision declaring the petitioner the absolute owner
of the parcels of land with an area of fifty (50) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>
more or lets involved in said cases and covered by the said titles; that
likewise in a compromise agreement dated 16 March 1953 entered into between
petitioner and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc., on the one
hand, and the respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> on the
other, and duly approved by the Court in its </span>decision in <span style="">the aforementioned civil cases, the
respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, after admitting that
they were "under a mistaken impression of the nature of their rights in
said property," and after examining the various </span>documents <span style="">evidencing </span>the ownership to the said
property, voluntarily and <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span> recognized
the "complete, absolute and indefeasible title in fee simple of the OWNERS
(J.M <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc.) over said property, and
hereby renounce, cede and quitclaim unto and in favor of the OWNERS (J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc.) any right, title or interest of
whatever nature that they may have had in the past, or may now or may have in
and to the said property in the future"; that the Supreme Court in its
decision promulgated on 30 May 1961, in G.R. NO. L-13768 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, et al. vs. J.M.
<span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc., et al.", upheld the
validity of the said decision (Annex "A") and compromise agreement
(Annex "B"); that on 16 February 1962, or nine (9) years after the
compromise agreement (Annex "B") was executed and the decision (Annex
"A") was rendered, the same respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
filed a complaint to annul and rescind the compromise agreement (Annex
"B") before the Court of First Instance of Manila and docketed
therein as Civil Case No. 49657 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>, et al. vs. J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co., Inc., et al."; that the parcels of land involved in this Civil
Case No. 49657 are the same fifty (50) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>
involved in the aforementioned Civil Case Nos. Q-135, Q-139, Q-174, Q-177 and
Q-186; that the Court of First Instance of Manila in an order dated 25 March
1962 dismissed said Civil Case No. 49657 on the ground of no cause of action
and on the ground of improper venue; that the same respondents surnamed Deudor
appealed the said order to the Supreme Court and the appeal was docketed as
G.R. NO. L-20105; that the Supreme Court on <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1963</st1:date> rendered a decision in said G.R. NO.
L-20105 sustaining the dismissal of Civil Case No. 49657 by the Court of First
Instance of Manila on the grounds of no cause of action and improper venue and
the Supreme Court further ruled that the complaint filed by the same
respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> over the fifty (50) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>, subject matter of the compromise agreement in
Civil Case Nos. Q-135, etc., is already barred by the decision in G.R. NO.
L-13768; that after the compromise agreement was rescinded insofar as the
obligation of the petitioner and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Inc., to pay the respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> the
amounts stipulated in the compromise agreement is concerned, the petitioner
herein obtained the possession of the fifty (50) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>
occupied by squatters through the filing of various <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suits; that in spite of the foregoing two (2) decisions of the Supreme Court,
the same respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> assisted by the
same counsel, filed an action against the same defendant who is now the
petitioner in this case for the same cause of action over the same parcels of
land involved in Civil Case No. 49657 particularly 29.5 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>
thereof; that the complaint which is the same as that of Civil Case No. 49657
was filed before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Branch VIII, presided by the respondent Judge and docketed therein as Civil
Case No. 8080 and that said complaint principally seeks to annul the decision
rendered by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch IV; that this is the
third case involving the same cause of action and subject matter filed by the
respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> against the same
petitioner; that immediately after the filing of Civil Case No. 8080 and more
particularly on 19 March 1964, the respondent court issued an order restraining
the enforcement of the decision dated 10 April 1953 rendered by the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Branch IV, and restraining the petitioner and its agents from ejecting or
threatening to eject the respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>
and all persons deriving rights from said respondents; that on 2 April 1964,
the petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. 8080 on the following
grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the complaint states no cause of
action;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the cause of action is barred by prior
judgment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the cause of action is barred by the
statute of limitations; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That there is non-<span class="SpellE">joinder</span>
of an indispensable party in the person of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Inc.;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">that
on 28 October 1964, and prior to the resolution of the petitioner's Motion to
Dismiss, the petitioner filed a pleading entitled "COMMENTS AND/OR
DISCUSSION, ETC.", challenging the jurisdiction of the respondent court
over the subject matter of the action or suit in Civil Case No. 8080, citing as
authority <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, the decision of the Supreme Court
in G.R. NO. L-16252 entitled "Rosario <span class="SpellE">Mas</span> versus
Elisa <span class="SpellE">Dumara-og</span>, et al.", promulgated on 29
September 1964; that on 23 January 1965, the respondent Judge issued a
one-paragraph order denying the aforesaid motion to dismiss; that on 23
February 1965, the petitioner filed its answer to the complaint of the
respondent surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>; that from and after the
filing of the complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 8080 up to the present, the
respondent court in violation of and contrary to the provisions of Rule 12,
Section 2, of the Rules of Court, has issued and continues to issue orders <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>granting various complaints in intervention filed by persons who do not
have any interest whatsoever in the subject matter of the litigation and
against whom final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgments for
eviction have been rendered by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branches IV
and V and at the same time has issued and continues to issue orders <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> restraining the enforcement of the said final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgments without requiring the filing
of bonds as directed by Rule 58 of the Rules of Court; that under date of 8
February 1965 the respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> filed a
Petition to Allow the Director of Lands and his duly authorized representative
and/ </span>or any private land surveyor to survey and relocate the boundaries
of the land in litigation, to which petition the petitioner filed, its
corresponding opposition; that notwithstanding the opposition of the petitioner
and the fact that the court has no jurisdiction the respondent court issued an
order on 20 February 1965 in Civil Case No. 8080 authorizing the respondents
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> "to request the Director of
Lands and/or any private surveyor to make the necessary relocation and survey
of the parcels of land involved x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and to employ the services of a duly licensed surveyor to
make the necessary survey and relocation"; that pursuant to said order,
the respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> are threatening or
about to cause the survey and relocation of the parcels of land involved in
said Civil Case No. 8080 in violation of and to the great prejudice of the
rights of petitioner as owners of the land and of its buyers; that 80% more or
less of the 29.5 <span class="SpellE"><u>quiñones</u></span> involved in Civil
Case No. 8080 have already been sold by petitioner to third persons for
valuable consideration and for which certificates of title have already been
issued in their names; that under date of 15 February 1965, certain persons
namely, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> del Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alquiros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, Rosario de Torres, Tomas <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>,
claiming to have rights and interests over an area of 9.5 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span>
indicated in orange shade of Annex "A" of their motion and which does
not form part of the 29.5 <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> involved in Civil
Case No. 8080 filed an Amended Motion for Intervention in said Civil Case No.
8080; that this Amended Motion for Intervention was opposed by the petitioner
as well as by the respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span> on the
ground that the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> persons do not have any
interest in the subject matter of the litigation; that on the day following the
filing of the said Amended Motion for Intervention and more particularly on 16
February 1965, the respondent Judge without any notice to petitioner and
without requiring the filing of a bond, issued an order <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> enjoining the petitioner, its agents or
representatives from "selling or in any way disposing of any portion of
the x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> lands"
claimed by the said <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span>
del Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alquiros</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, Rosario de
Torres, Tomas <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, and <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>, and indicated in orange shade of Annex
"A" of their motion, although said parcels of land are not involved
in Civil Case No. 8080; that by reason of the issuance of the foregoing illegal
orders by the respondent judge, and of the use of force, violence and
intimidation employed by the respondents surnamed <span class="SpellE">Deudor</span>,
including <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> del Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alquiros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, Rosario de Torres, Tomas <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span>,
together with the squatters in the area and against whom final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgments for their eviction have been rendered
by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, and in
whose favor injunctions have been issued by the respondent court, the
petitioner and its managing partner, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Inc., have been prevented from entering, developing and subdividing <span style="">the land and from maintaining and repairing
the existing roads in the subdivision to the great prejudice not only of the
petitioner but also of those buyers residing therein; that buyers of lots from
the petitioner have likewise been prevented from constructing their homes
and/or continuing with the construction of their homes already began prior to
the issuance of the orders of injunction; that unless and until respondents and
their agents are restrained the petitioner will suffer substantial and
irreparable injury in its subdivision business; that the respondent court in
issuing all the foregoing orders has acted without or in excess of its
jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion; that there is no appeal, nor
any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law; and that
the petitioner is ready, willing and able to post a bond in such amount as may
be fixed by the Supreme Court for damages in case the petitioner is finally
adjudged not to be entitled to the relief prayed for.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Surveyor's Division GLRO; that the registrants mentioned in LRC No. 7681 whose

proceedings in LRC No. 7681 although the applicants knew or could have known by
the exercise of necessary diligence the names and addresses of the herein
claimants (<span class="SpellE">Deudors</span>) and their predecessors in

of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dated February 28, 1957
and January 10, 1958 rescinding the compromise agreement entered into by the
petitioner J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> and the respondents, all

In affirming the orders, this Court recognized the ownership of J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co. over the disputed lands, the latter, being
the holder of a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, this Court observed that
"considering that the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> had a Torrens

In affirming the order rescinding the compromise agreement only in so far as
the obligation of J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, <span class="SpellE">INc</span>.
to make further payments, this Court necessarily decided that the land in
dispute was owned by J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> as possessor of a
valid title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this Court considered
the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> as mere physical possessors of the fifty
(50) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> of land and that the delivery of the
first twenty (20) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> was a delivery from one in
physical possession to another who is the rightful owner can further be
inferred from the Court's statement that the obligation to deliver the other
thirty (30) <span class="SpellE">quiñones</span> of land arose from the fact that
the J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> &amp; Co., Inc. is the owner and the
promise made by the <span class="SpellE">Deudors</span> in the Compromise
Agreement.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>

735 null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">initio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>because, according to said court,
that title was based on Decree of Registration No. 17431 in LRC No. 7681 that
was null and void, said decree having been issued pursuant to a decision of the
Court of Land Registration in LRC No. 7681 which had no jurisdiction to render
said decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As We have adverted to, Original Certificate of Title No. 735
covers two big parcels of land:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parcel
1, known as the Santa Mesa Estate, and Parcel 2, known as the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records show that these two parcels of land had been subdivided into numerous
lots, and most of those lots had been sold to numerous parties-Parcel 1 having
been converted into a subdivision known as the Santa Mesa Heights Subdivision,
and the lots had been sold to private individuals and entities, such that in
that subdivision now are located the National Orthopedic Hospital, the station
of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation Co. (<span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>),
<span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Domingo Church, <st1:place><st1:placename>Lourdes</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype><span style="">Church</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> and others.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, as a result of the sales of the lots into which Parcel 1
was subdivided, transfer certificates of title were issued to the purchasers of
the lots, and these transfer certificates of title were based upon transfer
certificates of title that emanated from Original Certificate of Title No.
735.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court declared null and
void all transfer certificates of title emanating, or derived, from Original
Certificate of Title No. 735.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The decision of the trial court declaring null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">initio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>Original
Certificate of Title No. 735 would invalidate the title over the entire area
included in Parcel 1-which admittedly includes the six parcels <span style="">of land claimed by the plaintiffs-and also
the </span>title over the entire area included in Parcel 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let it be noted that Parcel 1 has an area of
8,798,644.10 square meters, more or less and Parcel 2 has an area of 15,961,246
square meters, more or less; while the six parcels of land claimed by the
plaintiffs have an aggregate area of only 495,453.7 square meters, more or
less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the area of the <span style="">six </span>parcels of land claimed by the
plaintiffs is only a little over <span style="">two </span>per
cent (2%) of the aggregate area of Parcel 1 and Parcel 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the decision of the trial court nullified
Original Certificate of Title No.735, without any qualification.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial court held that the Court of Land Registration had
no jurisdiction to render the decision in LRC No. 7681 because during the
registration proceedings, after the original application and notice of hearing
had been duly <span style="">published, </span>the
plan of Parcel 1 was amended and no publication regarding the amended plan <span style="">was </span>made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court pointed out that the area and
description of Parcel 1 in Decree of Registration No. 17431 are not identical
with the area and description of Parcel 1 applied for and published in the
Official Gazette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
stressed on the point that publication is one of the essential bases of the
jurisdiction of the court to hear and decide an application for registration
and to order the issuance of a decree of registration, as provided in Act 496
(Land Registration Act).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We believe that the lower court erred when it held that the <st1:street><st1:address>Land
  Registration Court</st1:address></st1:street> was without jurisdiction to
render the decision in LRC No. 7681.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Section 23 of Act 496, the registration court may allow, or order,
an amendment of the application for registration when it appears to the court
that the amendment is necessary and proper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Section 24 of the same fact the court may at any time order an
application to be amended by striking out <span style="">one
or more parcels or </span>by severance of the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amendment may be made in the application
or in the survey plan, or in both, since the application and the survey plan go
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the amendment consists in
the inclusion in the application for registration of an area or parcel of land
not previously included in the original application, as published, a new
publication of the amended application must be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the new publication is to give
notice to all persons concerned regarding the amended application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without a new publication the registration
court can not acquire jurisdiction over the area or parcel of land that is
added to the area covered by the original application, and the decision of the
registration court would be a nullity insofar as the decision concerns the
newly included land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is
because without a new publication, the law is infringed with respect to the
publicity that is required in registration proceedings, and third parties who
have not had the opportunity to present their claim might be prejudiced in
their rights because of failure of notice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But if the amendment consists in the exclusion of a portion of the area
covered by the original application and the original plan as previously
published a new publication is not necessary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the latter case, the jurisdiction of the court over the remaining
area is not affected by the failure of a new publication.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"In the case at bar We
find that the original plan covering Parcel 1 and Parcel </span>2 that accompanied
the application for registration in LRC No. 7681 was amended in order to
exclude certain areas that were the subject of opposition, or which were the
subject of another registration case; and the Chief of the Survey Division of
the Court of Land Registration was ordered to determine whether the amended
plan included lands or areas not included in the original plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In compliance with the order of the
registration court said Chief of the Survey Division informed the court that no
new parcels were included in the new (or amended) plan."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Oddly enough, when the lower court said that the area of
Parcel 1 in the decree of registration is bigger than the area of Parcel 1 in
the application as published, it did not mention the fact that <u>the difference
in area is only 27.10 square meters</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe that this difference of 27.10 square meters is too minimal to
be of decisive consequence in the determination of the validity of Original
Certificate of Title No. 735.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
error on the part of the lower court to lay stress on this circumstance and
made it a basis for ruling that because in the amended plan there is this
increase in area as compared to the appearing in the application as published,
the Land Registration Court did not have jurisdiction to render the decision
decreeing the registration of Parcel 1 in LRC No. 7681.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief of the Survey Division of the Court
of Land Registration, in his report to the court of January 24, 1914 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 22), stated that the new plan of Parcel 1 did not
include any land that was not included in the original plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That report was made precisely in compliance
with the order of the registration court, in the decision of December 29, 1913
in LRC No. 7681, to inform the court "<span class="SpellE">si</span> <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">nuevos</span> <span class="SpellE">planos</span>
<span class="SpellE">incluyen</span> o no <span class="SpellE">terreno</span> <span class="SpellE">que</span> no <span class="SpellE">haya</span> <span class="SpellE">sido</span>
<span class="SpellE">comprendido</span> en <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">planos</span> <span class="SpellE">originales</span>." That
report was submitted by the Chief Surveyor "<span class="SpellE">despues</span>
de un <span class="SpellE">detenido</span> <span class="SpellE">estudio</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">planos</span> <span class="SpellE">unidos</span>
a <span class="SpellE">los</span> <span class="SpellE">expedientes</span>."
Under the foregoing circumstances, our inference is that the area of 27.10
square meters was already included in the original plan, and that the computation
of the area in the original survey must have been inaccurate; and the error was
corrected in the <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span> of the area when the
amended plan was prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We made a
careful study and comparison of the technical description of Parcel 1 appearing
in the application as published, and the technical description appearing in
Decree of Registration No. 17431 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 19, 19-A and
Z-6), and We accept the explanation of counsel for the appellant that this
seeming increase of 27.10 square meters had been brought about 'by the fact
that when the amendment of the plan was made, the distances and bearings in a
few points along the southwestern boundary (Please see <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
19) were brought to the nearest millimeter and to the nearest second
respectively; whereas, the computation of the survey in the original plan was
to the nearest decimeter and to the nearest minute only.' We believe that this
very slight increase of 27.10 square meters would not justify the conclusion of
the lower court that 'the amended plan x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> included additional lands which were not originally
included in Parcel 1 as published in the Official Gazette.' It being undisputed
that Parcel 1 has an area of more than 8,798,600 square meters (or 879.86
hectares), We believe that this difference of 27.10 square meters, between the
computation of the area when the original plan was made and the computation of
the area when the amended plan was prepared, can not be considered substantial
as would affect the identity of Parcel 1."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge should have dismissed Civil Case No. 8080.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaints in intervention should likewise be dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An intervention is regarded as colla­teral or

Case No. 8080 necessarily includes that of the complaints in intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the records show that the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> were allowed to intervene because of their
legal interest in the proceeding which consists in the possible declaration of
Original Certificate of Title No. 735 as null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, if Original Certificate of
Title No. 735 is found by this Court to be null and void then petitioner J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> will lose all claims of ownership over the lands

reversed by the Supreme Court and consequently there is no more doubt as to the
validity of Original Certificate of Title No.735.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
no longer have any interest in the principal case.</p>
