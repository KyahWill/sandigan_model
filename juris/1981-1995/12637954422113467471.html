<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The case at bar calls simply for the application 
of the provisions of Presidential Decrees Numbered 967 and 1304,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> amendatory of Republic Act No. 477.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY">R.A. No. 477 was enacted for the purpose of providing for the 
administration and disposition of properties (including the proceeds and income 
thereof) transferred to the Republic of the Philippines under the Philippine 
Property Act of 1946 and R.A. No. 8, as well as the public lands (and 
improvements thereon) transferred to the National Abaca &amp; Other Fibers 
Corporation under Executive Order No. 29 dated October 25, 1946 and Executive 
Order No. 99 dated October 22, 1947.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> Duran applied for and was in due 
course awarded on <st1:date month="11" day="13" year="1952">November 13, 
<span>1952</span></st1:date><span>, </span>a parcel of land in accordance with 
the provisions of R.A. No. <span>477.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>The land is situated 
in <span class="SpellE">Tacunan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tugbok</span>, 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, and has an area of <span>45,978 
</span>square meters.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The award to 
Duran carried with it a restriction, set out in Section <span>8 </span>of the 
Act, that the land thus acquired "shall not be subject to encumbrance or 
alienation from the date of the award *** and for a term of ten years from and 
after the date of issuance of the certificate of title." The restriction 
notwithstanding, Duran and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span>, 
executed on November <span>3, 1954 a </span>Deed of Sale of Rights and 
Improvements over the parcel of land awarded to them <span>in </span>favor of 
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span>, in consideration of the price of 
<span>P3</span><span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and the assumption by <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> of the obligation to pay the balance of the price 
of the property to the Board of Liquidators which was in charge of the 
implementation of R.A. No. 477.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> took possession of the land 
and planted coconut trees and other seasonal crops thereon.<span>&nbsp; </span>He 
paid the realty taxes corresponding thereto in the name of Duran, and completed 
payment of the price of the land to the Board of Liquidators pursuant to the 
agreement between said Board and Duran.<span>&nbsp; </span>He succeeded in causing 
the issuance of a sales patent (No. <span>523) </span>over the property, in the 
name of <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span> Duran, on <st1:date month="5" day="19" year="1966">May <span>19, 1966</span></st1:date><span>, </span>and the 
registration thereof <span>in </span>the Registry of Deeds on <st1:date month="9" day="2" year="1967">September <span>2, 
1967</span></st1:date><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">After the sale, Duran and his family left 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, residing first at 
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place> and later, at <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He did not return to 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> until <span>21 </span>years 
later, in <span>1975.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY">On Duran's return to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> <span>in </span><span>1975, 
</span><span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> requested him to execute the 
necessary deed of conveyance so that the title to the property might be finally 
placed in <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado's</span> name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Duran's response could not but have 
dismayed <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Duran not only 
refused <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado's</span> request; he procured the release 
to himself by the Register of Deeds of the title to the property, despite <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado's</span> objections, and even offered the land for sale 
to a certain <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Besa</span> who, 
however, refused to deal with him on learning of the previous sale of the same 
property to <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Duran capped his perfidy by instituting, on November 3, 1975, a 
suit against <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span>, for declaration of ownership, 
quieting of title, recovery of possession and damages, alleging that he had been 
paying the real estate taxes on the property; that in 1970 he had paid <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> the sum of P7,200.00 purportedly covering 
reimbursement of the price paid by the latter in virtue of the sale to him of 
the property in 1954 as well as the value of the improvements introduced by 
<span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> thereon; that after Duran's reacquisition of 
the land, he had acceded to <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado's</span> request to be 
allowed to stay on the property until he could locate a place to transfer his 
residence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Duran sought to substantiate these averments by his testimony 
during the trial.<span>&nbsp; </span>But although the Trial Court pronounced him a 
"worthy descendant of that biblical character named <span class="SpellE">Ananias</span>", and declared him "unworthy of credence and 
belief," on the basis of its close observation of his demeanor while 
testifying,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> said Court nonetheless 
felt itself unable to make an adjudication in <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado's</span> favor in view of the fact that the sale by Duran 
to <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> was quite evidently in violation of the 
prohibition laid down in Section 8 of R.A. No. 477, earlier adverted to, against 
the "encumbrance or alienation (of the land) from the date of the award ** and 
for a term of ten years from and after the date of issuance of the certificate 
of title." It therefore rendered judgment on <st1:date month="5" day="3" year="1977">May 3, 1977</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> 
portion of which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered declaring the 
Deed of Sale of Rights &amp; Improvements marked Exhibit 'D' null and void and 
ordering defendant to turn over the possession of the Lot No. 21, Psd-32969 
covered by Original Certificate of Title No. T-2458 located at <span class="SpellE">Tacunan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tugbok</span>, 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, to plaintiffs upon payment of 
the sum of THREE THOUSAND PESOS (P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>), AND THE 
SUM OF THREE HUNDRED THREE PESOS &amp; 56/100 (P303.56) paid as realty 
taxes.</blockquote>

disallowed.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Without costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">This decision the Court of Appeals affirmed <em>in</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>toto</em></span> on <st1:date month="5" day="2" year="1979">May 
2, 1979</st1:date>, on appeal taken by <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The latter moved for reconsideration, but 
this was denied on <st1:date month="6" day="27" year="1979">June 27, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Zozobrado seasonably appealed to this 
Court by <i>certiorari</i>, in accordance with Rule 45 of the Rules of 
Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Emilio <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> has since died,

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the execution of the sale in question on 
November 3, 1954 was a transgression of the provisions of Section 8 of R.A. No. 
477 prohibiting for a definite period its "encumbrance or alienation." But said 
Section 8 was amended by P.D. No. 968 on <st1:date month="7" day="24" year="1976">July 24, 1976</st1:date>, and again by P.D. No. 1304 on <st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1978">February 24, 1978<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> to read as follows:</st1:date></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 8.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Any provision of 
law, executive order, rules or regulations to the contrary notwithstanding, an 
applicant who has acquired land pursuant to the provisions of this Act and to 
whom a certificate of title has been issued covering such land, may sell, cede, 
transfer, or convey his rights and interests therein, including the permanent 
improvements on the land, to any interested party; <em>and all previous sales, 
transfers, conveyances and encumbrances regarding such land including the 
permanent improvements made and consummated prior to July 24, 1976, are hereby

<p class="BODY">It <span>is </span>clear that the defect in the sale by Duran to 
<span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> was cured and removed by the above mentioned 
presidential decrees; and under the facts, <span class="SpellE">Zozobrado</span> 
is entitled to the full ownership of the land in question, as well as to recover 
the damages caused to him by the <span class="SpellE">Durans</span>' perfidious 
acts in attempting to renege on a transaction voluntarily entered into by 
them.</p>
