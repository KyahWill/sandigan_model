three (3) lady police officers (Pfc. Armenia S. Pilueta, Pfc. Virginia Eslomot

with narcotics command, Philippine Constabulary, Camp <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

was identified in open court on October 10, 1984 by Pfc. Pilueta and Pfc.
Eslomot as accused Cornelio Marilao.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

the surveillance and intelligence team headed by Lt. Manuel Barcena, Pfc.

Antipolo, with the end in view of busting the drugs operation of accused and/or
arrest him.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Not long after, the team proceeded to Antipolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the team had studied the location and
terrain of M.H. del Pilar and de la Paz streets, the team decided to disperse
within the perimeter of the area, i.e., Pfc. Pilueta was designated to buy the
prohibited drug from accused while the other members of the team including its
team leader positioned themselves at a vantage position in relation to where
Pfc.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> Pilueta was positioned.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

that evening, Pfc. Pilueta accompanied by their confidential informer chanced
upon accused <span class="GramE">who</span> was then in front of his parents’ 2­-storey<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> house, the first floor of which was utilized
as a restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately Pilueta
informed accused of her desire to buy dried marijuana leaves and at the same
time she asked the price of one line or 100 grams of the prohibited
leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused answered that he sells
at P180.00 per line.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, Pilueta handed to accused four (4) P100 bills
(Exhibit 'B').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of the money,
accused left Pilueta and the informer and proceeded towards his residence with
the purpose of getting the prohibited leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A few minutes later, accused returned and handed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">to </span>Pilueta the prohibited drugs - about 200 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">grams.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, Pilueta ‘stretched her head by way of signal to her team
members that she has consummated her transaction with accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a few seconds, Pilueta and her companions
swarmed over the person of accused identifying themselves as NARCOM agents.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Pilueta.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Desirous of<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>recovering
more prohibited drugs from accused, the NARCOM agents rushed inside the
residence of accused where they found another 100 grams of the prohibited stuff
beneath the floor inside their ‘restaurant-residence’.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the apprehension of accused, he was brought to the
NARCOM headquarters at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>Crame</st1:placename></st1:place>
where he was interrogated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
Pilueta testified that the effects of the crime - the 300 grams of dried
marijuana leaves plus the two (2) P100 bills recovered from accused where
deposited with the P.C. Crime Laboratory or with the Property Custodian of the
NARCOTICS Investigation Unit.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

since 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified as
follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was one of the members of
the Barcena Team that proceeded to Antipolo, Rizal in the evening of <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1984</st1:date> to bust the drug
trafficking activities of accused along M. H. <span class="GramE">del</span>
Pilar and de la Paz Streets in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Antipolo
Rizal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She emphatically declared that
from the time Pfc. Pilueta started to buy marijuana from accused up to the time
the deal was consummated, she and the other NARCOM agents were in front of the
residence of the accused, approximately 10 to 15 feet away from them thus
enabling</span> them to have a clear view of the transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> declaration of witness is to the effect that she saw accused deliver
or hand down to Pfc. Pilueta the dried marijuana leaves which the latter bought
from the former, including the recovery of the two (2) P100 bills from accused
and an additional 100 grams of prohibited drugs which were taken </span>inside
the residence of accused.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

requesting that an examination be made on the specimens attached thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately upon receipt of said letter, she
assigned Lt. Therese Ann Bugayong, a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">
chemist to conduct a careful analysis and examination of the specimens.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the assignment of the case to Lt.
Bugayong, Captain Chambers saw to it that she was personally present during the
examination of the specimens as in fact she was shown the results of said examination
of Lt. Bugayong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The chemistry report
(Exhibit 'D') clearly shows that the specimens <span class="GramE">which</span>
were subjected to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">an </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">analysis and examination by Lt. Bugayong gave

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the evidence for the defense consists of the
uncorroborated oral testimony of accused, 27 years old, single, a vendor and a
resident of M. H. <span class="GramE">del</span> Pilar, Antipolo, Rizal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His testimony as stated in the decision of
the trial court is as follows:</p>

him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admits though that in the
evening of <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1984</st1:date>, at

his parents’ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">residence in Antipolo,
Rizal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At said meeting, Myra Matangga
told him that they wanted to buy marijuana leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He replied that he does not have the stuff
nor sells the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Myra Matangga's
companion the </span><u>tomboy</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(she
was referred to as one of the two tomboys who testified against him) butted in
and reiterated their desire to buy the stuff as they badly needed the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused answered again in the
negative.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">he </span>was going

appointment when he was called by two (2) <u>tomboys</u> and <st1:city><st1:place>Myra</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he approached the group, the <u>tomboy</u>
who was earlier insisting to buy marijuana from him drew her gun and poked the
same at him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, the group
told accused that they were bringing him with them to the headquarters because
he was caught selling dried marijuana leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The group then boarded him in a car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Once inside the car, he was shown a bag full of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Matangga told the group that the stuff <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was

Myra's accusation but Myra stood her ground thus he was asked to sign a

3, TSN, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">February 21, 1985).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also admitted on cross-examination that he
was certain that the marijuana leaves shown to him by the <u>tomboys</u> were
indeed marijuana leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He explained
that he could not have been mistaken about that because he was once a frequent

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, Cornelio Marilao submits that the court <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>quo</u> erred in convicting him
because of the insufficiency of the prosecution's evidence to prove his guilt
beyond reasonable doubt due to:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the
failure to present the male confidential informant as one of the prosecution's
witnesses which according to the accused is imperative to corroborate the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">testimony </span>of the arresting officer; (b)
the non-presentation by the prosecution of the alleged marked four P100.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">bills </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">two of </span>which were recovered from the
person of the accused when he was searched, and the police logbook where the

transaction was held, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">occurred </span>in
a public place, in front of the residence-restaurant of the parents of the

without the usual "look-out" of </span>the seller; and (d) on the
matter of the confiscated marijuana leaves, appellant claims that there was no
proof that the specimen so examined and found to be marijuana fruiting tops are
the same specimen actually taken from the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the appeal devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">People v.

as a witness of the informant, used by the members of the Constabulary
Anti-Narcotics Unit in entrapping the accused in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

fatal to the prosecution's case if his testimony would be merely corroborative
and cumulative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the
accused admitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>his brief,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the informant's testimony was merely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>corroborate
the arresting officer's testimony positively identifying the appellant in open
court as the seller of the dried marijuana leaves and the recipient of the four
marked P100.00 bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">Corroboration is not necessary if the details of the crime have
already been testified to with sufficient clarity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure to present all the eyewitnesses
to an act does not necessarily give rise to an unfavorable presumption,
especially when the testimony of the witness sought to be presented is merely
corroborative.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, there is no law requiring that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a
</span>testimony be corroborated in order to be believed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of a single witness if credible
and <span class="GramE">positive,</span> is sufficient to produce conviction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered that the matter of presenting witnesses for
the People is a prerogative of the prosecuting fiscal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The non-presentation by the prosecution of certain witnesses is not a
sufficient <span class="GramE">defense,</span> neither does it detract from the
prosecution's evidence, the number of witnesses called to testify being left
largely to the sound <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">discretion of the
prosecuting officers.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Thus, in instances where the accused
believes that the testimonies of said witnesses are important to his cause, he
should avail </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">them even by compulsory judicial process if
necessary.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the same way that the non-presentation of the informant by the
prosecution is not a sufficient defense, likewise, the non-presentation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>the marked f<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">o</span>ur P100.00 bills during trial does not militate against the

Based on the testimonies of the prosecution's witnesses, Pfc. Pilueta and Pfc.
Eslomot, it was clearly established that the marked bills were given by Pfc.
Pilueta to the appellant who in turn handed the marijuana leaves to the
former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has not been shown that the
NARCOM officers who caught the accused selling marijuana leaves have any motive
to falsely accuse Cornelio Marilao of such a serious crime<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
nor to maliciously implant evidence of <u>corpus</u> <u>delict</u> against the
latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is safe to assume that
the marijuana leaves submitted to the PC Crime Laboratory at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename>Crame</st1:placename></st1:place> are the same marijuana leaves
handed by appellant to Pfc. Pilueta based on the presumption under the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">law </span>that official duty has been
regularly performed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of the improbability of the sale to have transpired
in a public place coupled with the absence of a "look-out" for the
accused, the Court finds this a flimsy and shallow defense upon which to assert
the innocence of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has not been established by the latter
that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>street was indeed a
busy street so as to make the sale of marijuana improbable or incredible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court neither finds the necessity for the
prosecution to establish the presence of a "look-out" for the accused
without necessarily discounting the possibility of the presence of one, the
same not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">being </span>an element of the
crime punished under Section 4 of Republic Act No. 6425.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, unless the "look-out"
himself is arrested and prosecuted, the prosecution has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">no </span>means of determining his presence in the area.</p>

<p class="BODY">The more important consideration in the instant appeal is the
fact of positive identification of the appellant by two prosecution witnesses
as the seller of the marijuana leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This should prevail over his denials and inadmissions of having
committed the crime for which he was charged below since greater weight is
