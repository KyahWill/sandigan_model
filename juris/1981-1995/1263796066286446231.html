<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED AT LEAST ON
REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant of <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, who was then 20 years of age, left his hometown
in 1976 for San <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
in order to harvest <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During each harvest season, he stayed with
the <span class="SpellE">Baliton</span> family where he was given free board and
lodging.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whenever he was there, he slept
in the camarin near the Baliton house.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30</st1:time> in the
morning of <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1977</st1:date>,
while Lolita, a 13 year old barrio lass, was alone fold­ing clothes with her
12-year old friend Victoria Flores, appellant suddenly entered the house
holding a <span class="SpellE">balisong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He threatened the two girls that he would kill them and their families
if they screamed or told anyone about what would happen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he pulled Lolita towards him,
twisted her hands and put them at her back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He made her lie down, lowered her panty, opened the zipper of his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">pants, put out his sexual organ, went on top
of her, inserted his organ in her private part and then went through with the
push and pull movement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this instance
Lolita cried in pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All throughout this sexual abuse, the two girls were not able to
do anything because of the continuing threats of appellant who did not stop
brandishing his <span class="SpellE">balisong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After appellant left, Lolita's tears did not
stop flowing until her mother arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When asked for an explanation, both girls kept silent having in mind the
threat made by appellant that if they talk, he will kill them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lolita testified that this heinous act was repeated in January
1978 with appellant repeating the same threats on her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in February, while appellant was
away, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Lolita finally narrated to her
mother the <span class="SpellE">gruelling</span> experience she had.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Baliton</span>
immediately reported the matter to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain and on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="26" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">February 26, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

undergo a physical examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
medical findings included the following - "presence of old lacerations at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="15"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1978</st1:date>,
the matter was brought to the police of San <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, and this led to the filing of the information
charging appellant of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first and second assigned errors will be taken up together <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>they revolve around the same issue
of credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant insists that
the lower court should not have given the testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses much weight as said witnesses were not sincere, lacked candor, seriousness
and integrity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To discredit the
testimony of the victim, appellant maintains that both of them were in fact
sweethearts who before <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="12">Decem­ber 21,
 1978</st1:date> have had sexual intercourse on several <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">occasions in the <span class="SpellE">camarin</span>.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> To support this allegation,
he presented </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">evidence a ring
supposedly given to him by</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the victim.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> He further adds
that he even proposed marriage to the girl.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Next, appellant contends that the victim was obviously lying in
Court because of her testimony that her panty was only lowered up <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span>her thighs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His claim is that if this is true, then rape
could not have been committed because of the impossibility of insertion of the
penis into the victim's vagina.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also, according to the appellant the delay of the victim in telling
her mother and making a complaint only proves that there really was no rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon a
consideration of the whole record, We find the testimony of the victim aside
from being sufficiently corroborated by the other witness and by medical findings,
credible to any reasonable person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
true that there were a few inconsistencies but they are too minor to affect the
girl’s credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such inconsistencies
are well-expected to come from an un­exposed barrio lass not used to the <span class="SpellE">rigours</span> of a public trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Next, appellant failed to show Us a good reason for the girl's alleged
disposition to lie in court and the complicity of her family thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As he admitted, he was treated very well just
like any member of the <span class="SpellE">Baliton</span> family.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, it is very doubtful that the victim and her young friend would make up
a story of rape for no motive at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say, Lolita, a girl of such tender age, will not expose
herself to public shame and humiliation by having to undergo a physical examina­tion
and testify in open court if her rape charge is not true.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court cannot believe that the appellant and Lolita were in
fact sweethearts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ring presented in
evidence could not have belonged to the victim because, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">as has been successfully proven by the prosecution, it was too small
for her.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> It should also be noted that no other
substantial evidence to support appellant's claim, like love letters, notes or
other tokens was shown in Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The offer of marriage, instead of helping him in his defense,
betrays the appellant's culpability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was made in the presence of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain at
the time when an investigation was already being conducted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This could only be taken as an admission of guilt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Further­more, if the appellant and Lolita were really sweethearts, the latter
would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">have </span>readily accepted the
proposal of marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">there </span>been love between the two, the
girl would not have jeopardized their relationship by exposing everything to
her mother and to the authorities, much less filing a complaint for rape
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Regarding the appellant's
claim that in line with Lolita's testimony that her panty was only pulled down
to her thighs, there could have been no sexual inter­course, We find this
incorrect because said testimony did not stop there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The girl went on to say that her panty was
eventually torn, allowing the consummation of the sexual act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When you were sexually abused by Marcelo
Valdez on <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1977</st1:date>,
you said on cross examination that your <span class="SpellE">pantie</span> was
just lowered 6 inches above the knee, will you please tell <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the Court what happened to that <span class="SpellE">pantie</span> </span>when Marcelo Valdez sexually abused you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was torn, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where is that <span class="SpellE">pantie</span>
now?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
more, sir."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The delay on the part of the victim in telling her mother and
making a complaint should not be taken against her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of this delay was well-explained in
the lower court and that is, the girl feared for her own life and the lives of
her friend and their families.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court has already recognized that concealments by young girls of rape
against them are not uncommon because of threats on their lives.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
We have also repeatedly held that delay in reporting a rape incident due to
death threats is justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the third assignment of error, We agree with the lower court
that the following testimony of the accused?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">appellant is not only unreliable but hard to believe:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact is your activities while in the

<p class="BODY">Appellant's story appears incredible from every angle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is unbelievable that young Lolita, fresh
from her elementary grades, would lure a much older man to have sex with her
when the latter has not even told her about his feelings towards her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is even more difficult to believe that
this girl would suggest sex in a place very near her house, stay there for a
long period of time to have more sex, knowing the danger of being caught by any
member of her family or her neighbors.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, it is apt to consider the lower court's
observation that not only was appellant's testi­mony incredible but that
appellant did not appear as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">credible
witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Considering the testimony of the accused and the evidence he
adduced, this Court, try as it would, (sic) could not give any credence to the
testimony of the accused in view of the very unstable, nervous, shuffling and
hesitant manner in which it was given on the witness stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Accused
testified on three occasions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
first occasion, it was claimed that he was sick and the court granted the
motion to reset.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the succeeding times
he testified, he did so in the same nervous, excited, tense, shuffling and
hesitant manner, breathing heavily, frequently clearing his throat, sweating
profusely indicating not only unreliabi­lity but a troubled conscience as
well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But far more unreliable is his
testimony itself that <span class="SpellE">Baliton</span>, a young girl of 13
years would go up to him unsolicited and seek him in the afternoon when the pos­sibility
of detection was great and ask him who was not courting her to tell her that he
loved her and without his saying anything to her she kissed him and then openly
invited him to have sexual intercourse with her in a manner which would even
put courtesans or women of loose morals or easy virtue to shame.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The narration of the accused is difficult to
believe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Baliton</span>
was a barrio girl only 13 years old, of an age when one is still a child barely
entering the stage of puberty and residing in a barrio which is shielded from
the corroding influence of social and sexual mores and practices of highly
advanced societies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is ascribed to
her by the accused betrays it as a figment of a fecund imagination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being so, it fails to impress this Court for
evidence to be credible must not only proceed from a credible witness but must
be also credible in itself (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dayag</span>, 56 SCRA
439)."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
