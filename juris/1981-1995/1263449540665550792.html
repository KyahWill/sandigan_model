decision, order or ruling of the Commission on Elections<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which, in the case of Aratuc vs. COMELEC, 88 SCRA 251, was clearly defined to
be confined to questions of law, particularly violations of the Constitu­tion
and/or constitutional rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right
to due process is what has been noted to have been allegedly violated, more
than any other constitutional right, in petitions like the present which have
assailed resolutions of the COMELEC holding certain candidates disqualified
from running for an elective office on ground of what is popularly known as
"political turncoatism."</p>

<p class="BODY">Where allegations of denial of procedural due process have been
found to be clearly well-founded, factual or legal, <span class="GramE">We</span>
have taken the only course legally proper in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have set aside the COMELEC resolution
complained against, and remanded the case to the COMELEC for the observation of
the cardinal requirement of procedural due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Where <span style="">municipal elective positions are

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, <span class="GramE">We</span> perceive no sign
of complaint of denial of due process insofar as the sufficiency of noticed and
hearing is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that
all the evidence as was desired to be presented by petitioner who had duly
filed his Answer, have been duly admitted for evaluation by the COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only question presented for
determination, and which <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot avoid, is whether
the COMELEC resolution under review is supported by substantial evidence, which
may also be said to go into the broad concept of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have examined the evidence on record, and
We are satisfied that the COMELEC correctly adjudged its sufficiency to support
its con­clusion that petitioner was disqualified from running as NP candidate
for the position of Mayor of Taytay, Rizal, by reason <span style="">of violation of the constitutional provision expressly prohibiting
"turncoatism",</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as well as PD 1661 against "guest can­didates."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The COMELEC in its Resolution dated January 19, 1980, the
challenged resolution, on a petition seeking petitioner's dis­qualification
filed on January 14, 1980 by above-named private respondents, as NP candidate
for Mayor of Taytay, Rizal, found that "x x x Santos changed his political
party affiliation from the KBL as shown by the aforesaid letter-resignation
dated January 2, 1980 (Exh. A), wherein he was 'tendering my resig­nation as <u>MEMBER</u>,
Mun. <span class="GramE">Com. (Position) Kilusang Bagong Lipunan, Taytay, Rizal,'
to the NP, his present affiliation with the NP having been expressly admitted
by him (see also Exh.</span> B); that the NP, thru its Acting President Jose J.
Roy, initially revoked/withdrew the 'NP nomination in favor of Mr. Manuel
Santos and other candidates x x x because they were members of good standing of
the KBL as of January 2, 1980 x x x' and in view also of 'the provisions of the
Constitution against turncoatism' and the provisions 'of recent Presidential
Decree against Guest Candidates' (Exh. G); and that the NP revoked respondent
Santos' <span style="">designation as Municipal
Chairman of the NP <span style="">in </span>the
Municipality of Taytay (Exhs. 3 &amp; 4), although later said respondent Santos
was chosen as the NP official candidate for Mayor of said muni­cipality (Exh.
5), thereby violating Section 10, Article XII (C) of the Constitution and
Presidential Decree No. 1661, as amended."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts in this case as above recited find strong resem­blance,
if not almost exact similarity, with those in the case of Evasco vs. COMELEC,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> a
petition like the present, which We dismissed, there being substantial evidence
to support the challenged COMELEC resolution disqualifying candidate Evasco as
candidate of the NP for the position of Mayor of Liliw, Laguna for
"political turncoatism".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
said case, this Court noted that candidate Evasco attended as a member of the
7-man municipal committee the reorganizational meeting of the leaders and
members of the KBL held in the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1979</st1:date>, and thereafter said committee
organized itself on <st1:date year="1979" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1979</st1:date>
with Evasco also attending the same (Exh. C &amp; C-1); that admittedly said
Evasco submitted a letter of irrevocable resignation dated December 28, 1979 as
a member of the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) Chapter of the Municipality (Exh.
B), thereby clearly showing by the aforesaid overt acts that candi­date Evasco
was formerly affiliated with the KBL on November 24, 1979 or earlier, but has
later affiliated with the NP as shown in his certificate of candidacy for
municipal mayor of Liliw, Laguna, subscribed and sworn to on December 31, 1979,
(Exh. A), or within <span style="">six </span>(6)
months immediately preceding the election scheduled on <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1980</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
however, comes up with the contention that he has always been an NP and has
never ceased to be such, even when he joined the KBL and became a member of the
KBL, Municipal Committee of Taytay, <span class="GramE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleges with stress that KBL is not a
political party when he joined it, but a mere umbrella organization, a mere
movement to hasten the achievement of the goals, and firmly establish the gains
of the New Society, and so he cannot be said to have changed political party.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This argument does not appear to have been unequivocally put
forth in petitioner's Answer to the petition for his dis­qualification<span style=""> (Annex C to Petition), which explains the
lack of any ruling on this issue as raised by such argument, by the COMELEC in
its assailed resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case,
the contention was evidently rejected by the COMELEC; otherwise, it would have
denied the petition for petitioner's disqualification on ground of changing
political party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Our ruling in
Evasco and Gabatan, and finding striking similarity in the evidence upon which
We based Our finding of the existence of compliance with the substantial
evidence requirement for which We upheld the challenged resolutions of the
COMELEC in those cases, particularly the act of "resigning" from the
KBL, in whose municipal committees they were active members, an act obviously
unnecessary unless petitioners feel that in joining the KBL they had taken to a
distinct political aggrupation from the NP which remained as a distinct,
independent and active political party in the elections of 1978, for which
COMELEC accredited NP separately from the KBL, the conclusion seems inevitable
that KBL had always been a political party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conse­quently, one who actively identified himself with the KBL, without
any reservation that he keeps intact <span style="">his
</span>full status as an NP member, had joined the KBL as a distinct
aggrupation and ceased thereafter to be an NP.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Double affiliation is intolerable under a party system which is the very
essence of the parliamentary form of government <span class="GramE">We</span>
have adopted and have just started firmly to establish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The COMELEC's determination of whether the KBL was a political
party from the inception of its existence, distinct and separate from the NP is
undoubtedly an exercise of its constitutional power of administering the laws
relative to the conduct of elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This power is exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless
its exercise is tainted with error correctible by <i>certiorari</i> which
usually takes the form of lack or excess of jurisdiction, or grave abuse of
discretion, <span class="GramE">We</span> should not disturb the orders,
resolutions or other acts of the COMELEC.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
As was said in the early case of Morrero vs. Bocar, et al., 66 Phil. 429, the
decision of the COMELEC is beyond judicial interference except upon a clear
showing of such arbitrary and improvident use of its power as will constitute
denial of due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under its Resolution No. 1406, promulgated <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1979</st1:date>, laying down rules on the
accreditation of political parties, Section 1 thereof provides that any duly
registered political party in the <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="4">April
 7, 1978</st1:date> election shall be entitled to accreditation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to this Resolution, KBL was duly
accredited, separately from the NP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
KBL had always been <span style="">a political party
or aggrupation can, therefore, no longer be open to question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were KBL not such a political party, block
voting as was declared valid in the case of Peralta vs. COMELEC</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> could not have been availed of by it, as it
un­questionably did, in the 1978 <span class="GramE">elections.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>For block voting is voting for a political
party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the ruling in the cases of Evasco and Gabatan,
COMELEC can by no means then be held to have gravely abused its discretion to
justify <span class="GramE">Our</span> setting aside its assailed Resolution in
the instant petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Active involvement
in KBL political affairs as a party, such as being a member of the Municipal Committee
thereof was the primary and decisive consi­deration upon which
"turncoatism" was found to have been com­mitted in the aforesaid
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot avoid coming upon <span style="">the same conclusion here with how petitioner
had similarly manifested his adherence to the KBL as a political party which
earned for him from no less than ranking officials of the NP to which he claims
unbroken affiliation their regard of him as "a KBL of good standing",
for which initially, they cancelled h</span><span style="">is candidacy in the NP slate obviously in fear of his being actually a
"turncoat", from KBL to NP, that COMELEC correctly found him to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional provision against "political
turncoatism" already in force upon the effectivity of the <span style="">New </span>Constitution more than seven (7)
years ago, is clearly intended to apply to all elections held under its regime,
regardless of whether the holding of said elections is declared less than the
6-month period mentioned in the provision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The stance taken by petitioner that it should not apply in the last
election the holding of which was announced only a month <span class="GramE">before,</span>
is clearly not tenable, even only under the well-known legal maxim that where
the law does not distinguish, We should not distinguish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No right constitutionally protected under the
due process is involved for petitioner to complain against lack of sufficient
notice because of the less than <span style="">six </span>(6) months intervening between the
declaration of the holding of an election and the day of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution speaks so un­equivocally
with its innovative and mandatory provision, obedience thereof must be imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows that the applicability of PD No. 1661, being merely an
implementation, or in furtherance, of the <span style="">well-</span>studied
and wise constitutional provision is neither open to <span style="">doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="">prohibition </span>against <u>ex</u> <u><span style="">post</span></u><span style=""> <u>facto</u> <u>law </u></span>which petitioner invokes in his
mistaken belief <span style="">that </span>the decree,
if applied to him, is being given retrospective effect, which it is not, does
not apply, as We have already so held in effect in the earlier cases of Evasco
and Gabatan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decree could by no
stretch of the clear scope of the novel constitutional concept, be banned under
the <u>ex</u> <u>post</u> <u>facto</u> <u>law</u> clause of the Constitution,
for it merely provides, for a certain disqualification of a candidate aspiring
to be chosen to an elective office which, <span style="">being
a mere privilege, is a fit subject for reasonable statutory regulation, clearly
not penal in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As defined, <u>ex</u>
<u>post</u> </span><u><span style="">facto</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">law</span></u><span style=""> is </span><span style="">limited </span><span style="">in its scope only to matters criminal in nature.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We must, therefore, declare that the Resolution of the COMELEC of
<st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1980</st1:date>,
disqualifying petitioner and cancelling his certificate of candidacy suffers
from no reversible error or infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be enforced as <span style="">if </span>no
restraining order had been issued, for in issuing the restraining order, this
Court's sole purpose was to give petitioner a chance to be voted for, since the
question of his disqualification could not be resolved before the elections by
reason of time constraint, so that should he win and be ultimately declared <span style="">by </span>this Court not disqualified, the
people's will shall have been known and should be given effect, as is the
paramount object of holding elections, the instrument most valued in the
exercise of sovereignty by the people to whom such sovereignty belongs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed and the resolution of
<st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1980</st1:date> of the
COMELEC should be allowed to stand with all its legal effects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent from the majority decision dismissing the petition of
petitioner Manuel I. Santos who was duly elected and proclaimed as mayor of the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
at the local election of January 30, 1980 with an overwhelming plurality of
4,326 votes <span style="">against his KBL opponent
Ricardo J. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> (with a total of 15,463 votes
against his opponent's 11,137 votes) and has duly assumed the said office to
which he was elected since then to the present, and upholding the questioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution which would disqualify him on grounds of
alleged <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> disqualification of the
petitioner as an alleged turncoat from the KBL for having returned to the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party to which he had always belonged cannot
stand factual nor legal scru­tiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
letter of resignation of January 2, 1980 from the KBL which is reproduced in
full in the footnote hereof<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
shows that petitioner <span style="">resigned from the
KBL precisely because it had been converted into a political party separate and
distinct from the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party to which
petitioner had always belonged and therefore he was dis­associating himself
from the KBL "prompted by my desire to remain a loyal <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party member." Petitioner's action of resigning from the KBL is sanctioned
by no less than this Court's own solemn pronouncements in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Laban</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>
case</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> prior to the April 7, 1978 elections that
the KBL was but an umbrella organization and that the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
as well as those belonging to other parties would be free in the future
"to join the party of their choice assuming that the KBL will eventually
evolve into a new political party." To quote from Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> in
the said case, "In other words, by nominating as its own the candidates of
the KBL, the <span class="SpellE">Na­cionalista</span> Party merely gave the mass
of its loyal and die-hard party-men the opportunity to <u>vote distinctly as <span class="SpellE">Nacionalistas</span></u><i> </i>in the coming election, <u>leaving
it for the future,</u> when political matters shall have had more time and
opportunity to fully develop and firm themselves up in relation to the modes
and objectives of the New Society, for <u>each of them to join the party of
their choice,</u> <u>assuming the KBL will eventually evolve into a new
political party.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Until that time
comes,</u> it would be ignoring significant historical realities and
practically <u>placing political thought in a straight jacket</u> to recognize
the KBL as the exclu­sive vehicle for the articulation of political
ideals."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Due process and a sense of fair play demand that before the ver­dict
of the electorate as well as the President's order as published in the February
27, 1980 newspapers directing the withdrawal of all disqualifica­tion charges
against the opposition candidates who won in the elections, reserving the right
of the defeated KBL candidate to file an election pro­test, are thus swept
aside and disregarded, that a full dress hearing which may only be given in an
appropriate quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> proceeding or election
protest should first be had in order to take into account all the vital facts
and considerations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grounds of my dissent which are fully applicable <u>mutatis
mu­tandis</u> to this case are extensively set forth in my dissenting opinion
in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ticzon</u></span> disqualification cases<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
involving the mayoralty of San Pa<span style="">blo
City which I hereby reproduce by reference and incorporate as part hereof,
together with the separate opinion in the said cases of Mr. Justice Vicente <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, which I have hereto appended marked as An­nexes
"A" and "B" hereof, respectively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority decision at bar runs counter and cannot be justified
in the light of the liberal principles on the issue of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>
enunciated by a unanimous Court in the recent case of <u>Romeo S. Gonzales vs. <span class="SpellE">Co<span style="">melec</span></span></u><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Much less can it be reconciled with the
decision in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mitmug</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>
(G. R. No. </span><span style="">54082) </span><span style="">issued just this month (on March 24, 1981),
wherein the Chief Justice for a unanimous Court again reiterated that such
issues are better resolved in an <u>election protest</u> "conclusively
once and for all, instead of the parties being caught in the <u>procedural
meshes</u> of a pre-proclamation controversy," holding that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
With the canvassing completed, and the proclamation made, private respondent
emerging as the victor with right reserved to petitioner to file his cor­responding
election protest, this case has become moot and academic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, this mode of disposing the case is in accordance
with the <u>invariable principle followed</u> by this Court given its
formulation as to disqualification controversies in <span class="SpellE"><u>Aguinaldo</u></span><u><span style=""> v. </span>Commission on Elections </u>(G. R. <span style="">No. 53953, January 5, 1981), but likewise
applicable to petitions raising questions more appropriately decided in an
election protest, the <u>better view</u> as to the proceedings filed with us
after January 30, 1980 is to <u>dismiss such peti­tions without prejudice</u>
to having the issues forced upon in the appropriate contests before the proper
agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time that had elapsed since
the election emphasizes the validity and wisdom of such an approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is even more appropriate here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An election protest should settle the matter
conclusive­ly once and for all, instead of the parties being caught in the
procedural meshes of a pre-proclamation controversy."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I vote accordingly to grant the petition and to set aside the
ques­tioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
