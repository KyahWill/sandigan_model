The issue raised in this case involves the question of whether or not 
the Iglesia ni Cristo, as a corporation sole, is qualified to apply for 
registration of a 614 sq. meter parcel of land in its name in the light 
of the prohibition in Section 11, Article XIV of the 1973<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  Constitution the same issues raised in the identical case of Republic 
vs. Judge Candido P. Villanueva and Iglesia ni Cristo, 114 SCRA 875 
(June 29, 1982)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> , to which this Court has recently given a negative answer.
<p>
We can have no different answer in this instant case.
</p><p>
On August 7, 1979, respondent Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) filed with the 
defunct Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte an application for 
registration of a 614 sq. meter parcel of land situated in San Pedro, 
Vintar, Ilocos Norte allegedly acquired by respondent by virtue of a 
deed of sale dated April 10, 1978 from a certain Carmen Racimo whose 
predecessors-in-interest, it was claimed, possessed the same for more 
than thirty (30) years.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  
The application was filed, as stated therein, under the provisions of 
the Property Registration Decree (P.D. 1529, July 11, 1978).
</p><p>
The Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Director of Lands, 
opposed the application, alleging, among others, that neither the 
applicant nor its predecessors-in-interest have been in open, 
continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation of the 
land in question since June 12, 1945 or prior thereto (section 48(b), 
Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended by P.D. 1073); that the claim of 
ownership in fee simple on the basis of Spanish title or grant can no 
longer be availed of by the applicant who had failed to file an 
appropriate application for registration within the period of six (6) 
months from February 16, 1976 as required under Presidential Decree No. 
892;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  that the applicant is
 a private corporation disqualified under the Constitution to hold 
alienable lands of the public domain (Section 11 Article XIV); and that 
the parcel of land applied for is a portion of the public domain 
belonging to the Republic of the Philippines not subject to private 
appropriation.
</p><p>
On July 23, 1980 the respondent court rendered its decision adjudicating
 the land applied for registration in favor of the Iglesia ni Cristo, 
but with a reservation for road right of way purposes.  Respondent 
stated, among others, that the Iglesia ni Cristo with its Executive 
Minister Eraño Manalo as a corporation sole is not within the 
contemplation of Section 11, Article XIV of the new Constitution but 
said corporation sole can qualify as applicant pursuant to the provision
 of Section 14 of Presi­dential Decree 1520.
</p><p>
From the decision, the Republic of the Philippines elevated the case to 
this Court in this petition for review which We gave due course.
</p><p>
Reiterating its stand in the lower court, petitioner stresses private 
respondent's disqualification to hold lands of the public domain except 
by lease pursuant to Section 11 Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution.
</p><p>
Private respondent argues that Section 11 Article XIV of the 1973 
Constitution is inapplicable to the land involved herein because the 
land sought to be registered is a private property or has ceased to be 
part of the alienable public domain by reason of acquisitive 
prescription for more than thirty (30) years, and its adverse, 
continuous possession in the concept of an owner; that private 
respondent is but a mere administrator of the land titled in its name 
for the benefit of its members, creating thus, a trust relationship in 
its favor; that as trustee or authorized representative of its members, 
private respondent can exercise their right to have the questioned land 
titled in its name under the Property Registration Decree (1529) by 
express mandate of the law.
</p><p>
We agree with petitioner's stand, following our decision in Republic vs.
 Judge Candido Villanueva, et. al., 114 SCRA 875 (June 29, 1982) to 
which We have made reference at the threshold of this decision, as well 
as the subsequent cases of Republic vs. Hon. Arsenio Gonong, et. al., G.
 R. No. L-56025 (Nov. 25, 1982); Republic vs. vs. Court of Appeals, et. 
al., G. R. No.59447, and its companion case of Republic vs. Judge 
Dominador Cendaña, et. al., G. R. No. 60188 (Dec. 27, 1982).
</p><p>
All that has been stated by this Court in the aforemen­tioned cases in 
interpreting Section 48(b) of the Public Land Law (C.A. 141, as amended 
by R.A. 1942) applies with equal force in the instant case where the 
application for registration of the herein parcel of land was, in 
essence, sought on the basis of the alleged open, continuous, exclusive 
and notorious possession and occupation of the said land by respondent's
 predecessors-in-interest under a <em>bona fide</em> claim of 
acquisition pr ownership for at least thirty (30) years immediately 
preceding the filing of the application for registration on August 7, 
1979.
</p><p>
Records reveal that no application for confirmation of incomplete or 
imperfect title had been filed by respondent's predecessors-in-interest 
under Section 48(b) of the Public Land Law.  Under the law, the 
questioned land retains its public character.  The application for 
registration under Section 14 of the Property Registration Decree (P.D. 
1529) which, among others, recognizes possession of alienable lands of 
the public domain in the manner and for the length of time therein 
required as basis for registration of title to the land, did not remove 
the land from the operational effect of Section 48(b) of the Public Land
 Law.  It nevertheless strengthens the conclusion that the land never 
ceased to be part of the public domain.  Apparently, the pertinent 
provisions of law relied upon by respondent in invoking Section 14 of 
P.D. 1529 provide:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 14.  Who may apply.  The following persons may file in 
the proper Court of First Instance an application for registration of 
title to land, whether personally or through their duly authorized 
representatives: </p>
  <p> "1).  Those who by themselves or through their 
predecessors-in-interest have been in open, continuous, exclusive and 
notorious possession and occupation of alienable and disposable lands of
 the public domain under a <em>bona fide</em> claim of ownership since June 12, 1945 or earlier. </p>

  </p>
  <p> "A trustee on behalf of his principal may apply for original 
registration of any land held in trust by him, unless prohibited by the 
instrument creating the trust."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As indicated earlier, the issue raised is already a settled matter.  In Republic vs. Judge Candido Villanueva, et. al., <em>supra</em>, this Court made the following categorical pronouncement:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "As correctly contended by the Solicitor-General the Iglesia ni 
Cristo, as a corporation sole or a juridical person is disqualified to 
acquire or hold alienable lands of the public domain, like the two lots 
in question, because of the constitutional prohibition already 
men­tioned and because the said church is not entitled to avail itself 
of the benefits of Section 48(b) which applies only to Filipino citizens
 or natural persons.  A corporation sole (an "unhappy freak of English 
law") has no nationality (Roman Catholic Apostolic Adm. of Davao, Inc. 
vs. Land Registration Commission, 102 Phil. 596.  See Register of Deeds 
vs. Ung Siu Si Temple, 97 Phil. 58 and Section 49 of the Public Land 
Law). </p>
  <p> "The contention in the comments of the Iglesia ni Cristo (its 
lawyer did not file any brief) that the two lots are private lands, 
following the rule laid down in Susi vs. Razon and Director of Lands, 48
 Phil. 424, is not correct.  What was considered private land possessed 
by a Filipino citizen since time immemorial, as in Cariño vs. Insular 
Government, 212 U.S. 449, 531 L. ed. 594, 41 Phil. 935 and 7 Phil. 132. 
 The lots sought to be registered in this case do not fall within that 
category.  They are still public lands.  A land registration proceeding 
under Section 48(b) 'presupposes that the land is public' (Mindanao vs. 
Director of Lands, L-19535, July 10, 1967, 20 SCRA 641, 644). </p>
  <p> "As held in Oh Cho vs. Director of Lands, 75 Phil. 890, "all lands
 that were not acquired from the Government either by purchase or by 
grant, belong to the public domain.  As exception to the rule would be 
any land that should have been in the possession of an occupant and of 
his predecessors-in-interest since time immemorial, for such possession 
would justify the presumption that the land had never been part of the 
public domain or that it had been a private property even before the 
Spanish conquest. </p>
  <p> "In Uy Un vs. Perez, 71 Phil. 508, it was noted that the right of 
an occupant of public agricultural land to obtain a confirmation of his 
title under Section 48(b) of the Public Land Law is a "derecho dominical
 incoative" and that before the issuance of the certificate of title the
 occupant is not in the juridical sense the true owner of the land since
 it still pertains to the State." (114 SCRA 881-882) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Moreover, it may be observed that respondent relies strongly on the 
doctrine laid down in the 1925 case of Susi vs. Razon, 48 Phil. 424, 
reiterated in <em>Balboa vs. Farrales</em>, 51 Phil. 498, <em>Mesina vs. Vda. de Sonza</em>, 108 Phil. 361, <em>Manarpaac vs. Cabanatan</em>, 21 SCRA 743, <em>Miguel vs. Court of Appeals</em>, 29 SCRA 760, <em>Herico vs. Dar</em>,
 95 SCRA 437, to the effect that lands of the public domain which, by 
reason of possession and cultivation for such a length of time, a grant 
by the State to the occupant Is presumed, and the land thereby ceases to
 form part of the public domain, but is segregated therefrom as to be no
 longer subject to the authority of the Director of Lands to dispose 
under the public land laws or statutes.  As pointed out in the separate 
opinion by the herein ponente in the cases, of <em>Meralco vs. Hon. Floreliana Castro-Bartolome</em>, G. R. No. 49623 and<em> Republic vs. Hon. Candido P. Villanueva</em>, G. R. No. 55289 (June 29, 1982), to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I cannot subscribe to the view that the land as above described 
has become private land, even before title thereto, which is, as of this
 stage, said to be still "an incomplete or imperfect title," has been 
fully vested on the occupant, through the prescribed procedure known as 
judicial confirmation of incomplete or im­perfect title.  This is the 
only legal method by which full and absolute title to the land may be 
granted, to convert the land into a truly private land.  To secure such 
judicial title, only the courts can be resorted to.  The Director of 
Lands has lost authority over the land, insofar as its disposition is 
concerned.  His authority is limited to another form of disposition of 
public land, referred to as administrative lega­lization, resulting in 
the issuance of free patents, also based on possession, in which case, 
as in the issuance of homestead and sales patents, the land involved is 
undoubtedly public land.  The possessor of a piece of public land would 
have the option to acquire title thereto through judicial confirmation 
or administrative legalization.  The difference is that in the latter 
case, the area disposable to a citizen-applicant by the Director of 
Lands is limited to 24 hectares.  There is no limit to the area subject 
to judicial confirma­tion of incomplete or imperfect title, except 
possibly the limit fixed for a State grant under old Spanish laws and 
decrees, which certainly is much larger than that set for free patents. </p>
  <p> "It is because of the divestiture of authority of the Director of 
Lands to dispose of the land subject to judicial confirmation of 
incomplete and imperfect title that some statements are found in many 
cases, such as those cited to the effect that such land has ceased to be
 public land.  What these statements, however, really mean is that the 
land referred to no longer forms part of the mass of public domain still
 disposable by the Director of Lands, under the authority granted him by
 the public land statutes.  It, however, would not follow that the land 
covered by Section 48 of the Public Land Act has itself become private 
land.  The fact that its disposition is provided for in the aforecited 
Act which deals With "public land" gives rise to the very strong 
implication, if not a positive conclusion, that the land referred to is 
still public land.  Only when the court adjudicates the land to the 
applicant for confirmation of title would the land become privately 
owned land, for in the same proceeding, the court may declare it public 
land, depending on the evidence."

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
MAKASIAR, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I reiterate my dissent in Director of Lands vs. Hon. Guardson Lood, et al.  (Sept. 2, 1983, 124 SCRA 460, 470, 5).
</p><p>
The parcel of land of about 614 sq. m. sought to be registered by the 
Iglesia ni Kristo under the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496) and P.D.
 1529, is a private land, not a public land, originally owned by 
Florencio Recimo who acquired the same long before 1931.  On February 
18, 1931, Backrate Motor Co. acquired the same land by virtue of a deed 
of sale executed by the Provincial Sheriff of Ilocos Norte on October 
23, 1937.  Backrate Motor Co. sold the same to Pablo Agbayani who 
re­sold the same in May, 1945 to spouses Jose A. Racino and Carmen F. 
Racino, who in turn sold the same on April 10, 1978 to private 
respondent Iglesia ni Kristo.
</p><p>
As above stated, private respondent Iglesia ni Kristo applied for a 
voluntary registration of the same land under the Land Registration Act 
and P.D. 1529, and not for a confirmation of its title under Sec. 48(b) 
of the Public Land Act.  His applica­tion to title a private land was 
under the Land Regis­tration Act (Act No. 496) and pars. 2 and 3 of Sec.
 14, of P.D. 1529, not under Sec. 1 thereof on disposable land of the 
public domain.
</p><p>
Par. 2 of Section 14 of P.D. No. 1529 provides that the applicant must 
"have acquired ownership of private lands by prescription under the 
provision of existing laws" or under par. 3 must "have acquired 
ownership of land in any manner provided by law."
</p><p>
That the application of private respondent Iglesia ni Kristo, is for a 
private parcel of land acquired by prescription or in any other manner 
recognized by law, and not a parcel of land of the public domain, is 
emphasized by the fact that his application is based on both the Land 
Regis­tration Act, otherwise known as Act 496, which relates to private 
lands only and never to lands of the public domain.  The 
predecessors-in-interest of the Iglesia ni Kristo had possession of the 
same openly, continuously, exclusively and adversely against the whole 
world even before 1931.  The parcel of land in question therefore, being
 a private land, is not governed by Section 11 of Article XIV of the 
1973 Constitution.
