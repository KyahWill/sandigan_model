of the Court of Appeals condemning petitioner Rodolfo Suarez to pay moral
damages, exemplary damages and attorney’s fees in favor of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="SpellE">Manigbas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Manigbas</span> used to be a
security guard of the <span class="SpellE">D’Robe</span> Security Agency of which
petitioner, Capt. Rodolfo Suarez, was the general manager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was assigned to the Security Bank and
Trust Agency branch at <span class="SpellE">Sucat</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Paranaque</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="GramE">Metro</span>
Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During his tour of duty with the
said bank, he alleged that his employer pulled him out of his assignment and
later dismissed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>This <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">dismissal was </span>contested by him before the National Labor
Relations Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent found another employment with the RP Guardian Security
Agency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While he was with his second
employer, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Suarez </span>signed and sent a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">letter </span>to the Philippine Association of
Detective and Protective<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> Agency </span>Operators,
(PADPAO), an association of security agencies, which reported misdemeanors
committed by several of its guards, including the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remarks pertaining to respondent <span class="SpellE">Manigbas</span> states, to wit: "Padding payroll; used to
leave his post every weekend without a reliever <span class="GramE">nor</span>
permission from the Agency:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>misrepresentation on the submission of Daily Time Record." (p. 19,
Memorandum of Petitioner)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span><span class="GramE">Consequently</span>, plaintiff was dismissed by the RP <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">G</span>uardian Security Agency and was
unemployed for six (6) months until re-hired by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">said </span>agency but on temporary basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff claimed that the letter of
defendant Suarez to the PADPAO posed him to public ridicule, <span class="GramE">inconvenience,</span>
humiliation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span>contempt which
resulted in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">his </span>being blacklisted
by security <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">agencies
</span>giving him difficulty in finding employment and causing him mental
torture and anguish.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Suarez denied that respondent was summarily<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>relieved or dismissed from
employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">that </span>after his relief of his assignment
with the Security Bank and Trust Company branch at <span class="SpellE">Sucat</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Paranaque</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila, the respondent refused to accept re-assignment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">r</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">e</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">lief </span>was done <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">in <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span>accordance</span>
with the company rule not to allow guards <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to
</span>stay for a long <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">time </span>at
one post for security reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
letter complained of was a privileged communication consistent with the call of
the PADPAO <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">to </span>make available to
it information on misdemeanors of security guards.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was written in good faith and without any
intention to cause damage to the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rendered its decision in favor of the respondent
awarding moral damages in the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>;
</span>exemplary damages in the amount of P3,000; actual damages in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">amount </span>of P1,000; attorney's fees in
the amount of P2,000 and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
appeal to respondent court, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">said </span>decision
was affirmed with the modification eliminating the award of actual damages.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Basically, petitioner raises the following <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the regional trial court had
no jurisdiction over the case at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">bar </span>considering
that the total money claims of respondent is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">only </span>ten<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>thousand
pesos (P10<span class="GramE">,000</span>); and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the letter sent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">to </span>PADPAO is covered by the rule on
privileged<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> communication.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">In the </span>resolution
of <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 7.0pt">August </span>22, 1988</st1:date>, the petition was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">given </span>due course and the parties were
required to submit their respective memoranda within thirty (30) days from
notice thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed his
memorandum <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">of </span><st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">November </span>7,
 1988</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">while </span>respondent
filed his on <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the issue of lack of jurisdiction of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
in entertaining this case, petitioner’s contentions are devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While though it is clear from the complaint
filed that the total amount claimed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Manigbas</span>
is ten thousand pesos (P10,000) and that under BP 129, the Regional Trial
Courts shall exercise exclusive original jurisdiction in all cases in which the
demand, exclusive of interest and cost, or the value of the property in
controversy, amounts to more than twenty thousand pesos (P20,000), petitioner
is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from invoking this rule since he never
questioned this flaw until this case was appealed to the respondent Court of
Appeals from the adverse decision of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that any decision rendered
without jurisdiction is a total nullity and may be struck down at any time,
even on appeal before this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
only exception is where the party raising the issue is barred by <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tijam</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span>, 23 SCRA 29,
reiterated in Solid Homes, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Payawal</span> and Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 84811, August 29, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">While petitioner could have prevented <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">the </span>trial court from exercising jurisdiction over the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span>seasonably <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">taking </span>exception thereto, they instead invoked the very same
jurisdiction by filing an answer and seeking affirmative relief from it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is more, they participated in the trial
of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">case </span>by cross-examining
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the premises, petitioner
cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">now </span>be allowed belatedly
to adopt an inconsistent posture by attacking the jurisdiction of the court to
which they had submitted themselves voluntarily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tijam</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span>, supra)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the issue on whether or not the letter sent to the
PADPAO and signed by petitioner, considering the derogatory remarks on the
private respondent, is covered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span>the
protective mantle of privileged communication, the answer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>in the negative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, in support of his contention that
such letter is privileged communication, cites the case of U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span>, 37 Phil. 731, wherein the court laid down the
following:</p>

<p class="2Q">"A communication made in good faith upon any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">subject matter </span>in which the party
making the communication has an interest or concerning which he has a duty is
privileged if made to a person having a corresponding interest or duty,
although it contains incriminatory <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">or </span>derogatory
matter which, without the privilege, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">would
</span>be libelous and actionable." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(p.
</span>21, Memorandum for the Petitioner)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">And also the case of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
v. <span class="SpellE">Calvo</span>, 48 Phil. 919, where the Court held:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Even when the statements are found to be false, <u>if</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">there</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span><u>is</u> <u>probable</u> <u>cause</u> <u>for</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">belief</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span><u>in</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">their</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span><u>truthfulness</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">charge</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">is</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">made</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span><u>in</u> <u>good</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">faith</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, </span>the mantle of privilege may still
cover the mistake of the individual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
privilege is not defeated by the mere fact that the communication is made in
intemperate terms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A privileged
communication should not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">be </span>subjected
to microscopic examination to discover grounds of malice or falsity." (p.
22, Memorandum for the Petitioner)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Petitioner contends that the alleged
libelous letter to the PADPAO is a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">privileged
</span>communication, hence, not actionable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We believe that the letter sent is not really a privileged
communication.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Lu <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Sing vs. Lu <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> <span class="SpellE">Gui</span>, 76 Phil. 669, the
Court said that "the fact that a communication <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">is </span>privileged does not mean that it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">is </span>not actionable, the privileged character simply does away with
the presumption of malice which the plaintiff has to prove in such a
case." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">And </span>the evidence
necessary to prove malice on the part of the writer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">of a </span>privileged communication is not strictly documentary for it
may be either extrinsic, internal, and circumstantial, like any other fact
necessary to make <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">out </span>plaintiff's
case (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Canete</span>, 38 Phil. 253).</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly put <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">by </span>the
respondent Court:</p>

<p class="2Q">"In the present case, malice is strongly shown in appellant's
writing the letter which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">put </span>the
person of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in bad light before his peers
and the security agencies <span class="GramE">who</span> may have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">come </span>across
said letter in the course of his employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The said letter accused the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of
"padding payroll - Used to leave his post every weekend and without a
reliever nor permission from the agency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Misrepresentation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">on </span>the submission of Daily <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">Time
</span>Record."</span> These charges, however, were not duly substantiated
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">by </span>any
proof contrary to the PADPAO guidelines that the report on security guards been
based on "actual facts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">and </span>not
on imaginary or personal considerations." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the letter was written almost three months after <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> employment with the <span class="SpellE">D’Robe</span>
Security Agency of which the appellant was the general manager had already been
terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
termination caused him to file a labor case against the <span class="SpellE">D’Robe</span>
Security Agency with the then Ministry of Labor and Employment docketed as NLRC
NRC No. 5-3833-82 and resulted in the payment of his back wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With this in mind, appellant was guided and
motivated by revenge in writing and sending the derogatory letter to the PADPAO
which, in the guise of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">an </span>official
communication was designed to damage <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> name
as well as compromise his future employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">any </span>security agency associated with the PADPAO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, this would result in the
blacklisting of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> by prospective
employers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">with </span>the RP Guardian
Security Agency hangs on a balance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
consequence, he was dismissed; although he was re-hired after six months this
was on a temporary basis pending <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">the
outcome </span>of the present case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These significant facts evidently betray the conduct of appellant who
shall be denied the benefits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">of </span>qualified
privilege and justify the imposition of personal liability to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"A private communication, maliciously made by one person to
another, although in the performance of a legal, moral or social <span class="GramE">duty,</span> is not privileged (Imperial vs. <span class="SpellE">Ziga</span>,
L-19726, April 13, 1967, 19 SCRA 726).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to Justice Street in his work, Foundation of Legal Liability,
quoted in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Canete</span>,
</span>et al., (38 Phil. 253), malice is a "term used to indicate the fact

merely in response to duty, but merely to injure the reputation of the person
defamed (People vs. De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, (CA) 47 O.G.
