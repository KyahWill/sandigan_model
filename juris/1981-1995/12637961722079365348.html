consigned their payment of P24,000.00 for the full amount of the mortgage

<p class="BODY">Under the law they are entitled to full faith and credit upon
their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">face </span>(Ramirez v. <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, 21 SCRA 207 [1967]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, it has long been settled that a public document executed and
attested through the intervention of the notary public <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
25.0pt">is </span>evidence of the facts in clear, unequi­vocal manner therein
expressed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has in its favor the
presumption of regularity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To contradict
all these, there must be evidence that is clear, convincing and more than
merely preponderant (Gonzales v. C.A., 90 SCRA 185 [1979]; <span class="SpellE">Carandang-Collantes</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Capuno</span>, 123 SCRA 652 [1983]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidentiary value of a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> document guaranteed by public attestation in
accordance with law must be sus­tained in full force and effect unless impugned
by strong, complete and conclusive proof (<span class="SpellE">Chilianchin</span>

84 Phil. 714; El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino v. <span class="SpellE">Olviga</span>, 60 Phil. 17; De Jesus v. Grey, 59 Phil. 834; <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiangco</span> v. Pablo, 59 Phil.

<p class="BODY">A careful review of the records shows that the issues raised by
the petitioners in their petition and in their memorandum were all directly
refuted by the terms of the mortgage contracts themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is a well accepted principle of law that while <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence is admissible in a variety of ways to
explain the meaning of written contracts, it cannot serve the purpose of
incorporating into the contract additional contemporaneous conditions which are
not mentioned at all in the writing unless there has been fraud or mistake (De
la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>, 143
SCRA 6 [1986].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The excep­tions to the
rule do not apply to the case at bar, the terms of the mortgage contracts being
clear and unambiguous and there is no showing of any fraud, mistake or failure
to express the true agreement of the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As ruled by the Court in Del Rosario v. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(108 </span>SCRA 43 [1981] the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule forbids any addition to or contra­diction
of the terms of a written instrument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Oral testi­mony cannot prevail over <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a </span>written agreement of the parties, the purpose of the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule being to give stability to written
agreements and to remove the temptation and possibility of perjury, which would
be afforded if <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence were admissible (<span class="SpellE">Conde</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">v. </span>Court
of Appeals, 119 SCRA 245 [1981]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the misrepresentation of facts allegedly committed by
private respondents in claiming that petition­ers' full obligation is in the
amount of P46,835.00 appears to have no basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents convincingly ex­plained that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the </span>principal mortgage obligation amounted to P32,000.00 but in
view of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">expenses </span>incurred in
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">extra-judicial foreclosure sale </span>representing
cost of publication, interest and attorney's fees, the amount summed up to
P46,835.00 inclusive (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 48).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the foregoing considerations, the trial court correctly
gave full faith and credence to the mortgage contracts in dispute as against
testimonial evidence in contradiction thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it is a fundamental and settled rule that conclusions
and findings of fact by the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal
and should not be dis­turbed unless for strong and cogent reasons because the
trial court is in a better position to examine real evi­dence, as well as to
observe the demeanor of the witnesses while testifying in the case (Chase v. <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>, Sr., 136 SCRA 365); and the fact that the then
Intermediate Appellate Court adopted the findings of fact of the trial court
make the same binding upon this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>rule, the factual
findings of the appellate court are generally binding on the Supreme Court
(Collector of Customs of Manila vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 137 SCRA 3
[1985]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The findings of the Court of
Appeals when supported by substantial evidence are almost always beyond the
power of review by the Supreme Court (<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Cement
Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span>, 135 SCRA 15).</p>
