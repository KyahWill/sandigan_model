Court of Appeals, dated 04 December 1991, in CA-G.R. SP No. 26345 setting aside
and declaring without force and effect the orders of execution of the trial
court, dated 30 August 1991 and 27 September 1991, in Civil Case No. 87-41058.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents are recited in good detail by the appellate court
thusly:</p>

<blockquote>"On July 29, 1987 a Second Amended
Complaint for Specific Performance was filed by Ann Yu Asuncion and Keh Tiong,
et al., against Bobby Cu Unjieng, Rose Cu Unjieng and Jose Tan before the
Regional Trial Court,  Branch 31, Manila
in Civil Case No. 87-41058, alleging, among others, that plaintiffs are tenants
or lessees of residential and commercial spaces owned by defendants described
as Nos. 630-638 Ongpin Street, Binondo, Manila; that they have occupied said
spaces since 1935 and have been religiously paying the rental and complying
with all the conditions of the lease contract; that on several occasions before
October 9, 1986, defendants informed plaintiffs that they are offering to sell
the premises and are giving them priority to acquire the same; that during the
negotiations, Bobby Cu Unjieng offered a price of P6-million while plaintiffs
made a counter offer of P5-million; that plaintiffs thereafter asked the
defendants to put their offer in writing to which request defendants acceded;
that in reply to defendants' letter, plaintiffs wrote them on October 24, 1986
asking that they specify the terms and conditions of the offer to sell; that when
plaintiffs did not receive any reply, they sent another letter dated January
28, 1987 with the same request; that since defendants failed to specify the
terms and conditions of the offer to sell and because of information received
that defendants were about to sell the property, plaintiffs were compelled to
file the complaint to compel defendants to sell the property to them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendants filed their answer denying the material
allegations of the complaint and interposing a special defense of lack of cause
of action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the issues were joined, defendants filed a motion for
summary judgment which was granted by the lower court.  The trial court found that defendants' offer
to sell was never accepted by the plaintiffs for the reason that the parties
did not agree upon the terms and conditions of the proposed sale, hence, there
was no contract of sale at all.  Nonetheless, the lower court ruled that should the defendants
subsequently offer their property <span style="">for
sale at a price of P11-million or below, plaintiffs will have the right of
first refusal.  Thus the dispositive
portion of the decision states:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"‘WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
defendants and against the plaintiffs summarily dismissing the complaint
subject to the aforementioned condition that if the defendants subsequently
decide to offer their property for sale for a purchase price of Eleven Million
Pesos or lower, then the plaintiffs has the option to purchase the property or
of first refusal, otherwise, defendants need not offer the property to the
plaintiffs if the purchase price is higher than Eleven Million Pesos.</p>

<blockquote>"Aggrieved by the decision, plaintiffs appealed to this Court
in CA-G.R. CV No. 21123.  In a decision
promulgated on September 21, 1990 (penned by Justice Segundino G. Chua and
concurred in by Justices Vicente V. Mendoza and Fernando A. Santiago), this
Court affirmed with modification the lower court's judgment, holding:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">''’In resume, there was no meeting of the minds between the parties
concerning the sale of the property.  Absent such requirement, the claim for specific performance will not
lie.  Appellants' demand for actual,
moral and exemplary damages will likewise fail as there exists no justifiable
ground for its award.  Summary judgment
for defendants was properly granted.  Courts may render summary judgment when there is no genuine issue as to
any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of
law (<u>Garcia</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>, 176 SCRA
815).  All requisites obtaining, the
decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is legally justifiable.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘WHEREFORE, finding the appeal unmeritorious, the judgment appealed
from is hereby AFFIRMED, but subject to the following modification:  The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in the
aforestated decision gave the plaintiffs-appellants the right of first refusal
only if the property is sold for a purchase price of Eleven Million pesos or
lower; however, considering the mercurial and uncertain forces in our market
economy today.  We find no reason not to
grant the same right of first refusal to herein appellants in the event that
the subject property is sold for a price in excess of Eleven Million
pesos.  No pronouncement as to costs.</p>

the name of the Cu Unjiengs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We affirm the decision of
the appellate court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A not too recent
development in real estate transactions is the adoption of such arrangements as
the right of first refusal, a purchase option and a contract to sell.  For ready reference, we might point out some
fundamental precepts that may find some relevance to this discussion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An obligation is a juridical necessity to give, to do or not to
do (<i>Art. 1156, Civil Code</i>).  The
obligation is constituted upon the concurrence of the essential elements
thereof, <i>viz</i>:  (a) The <i>vinculum
juris </i>or <i>juridical tie </i>which is the efficient cause established by
the various sources of obligations (law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts
and quasi-delicts); (b) the <i>object </i>which is the prestation or conduct,
required to be observed (to give, to do or not to do); and (c) the <i>subject-persons
</i><span style="">who, </span>viewed from the
demandability of the obligation, are the active (obligee) and the passive
(obligor) subjects.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the sources of an obligation is a contract (Art. 1157,
Civil Code), which is a meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds
himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service
(Art. 1305, Civil Code).  A contract
undergoes various stages that include its negotiation or preparation, its
perfection and, finally, its consummation.  <i><span style="">Negotiation </span></i>covers
the period <i><span style="">from </span></i>the time
the prospective contracting parties indicate interest in the contract <i><span style="">to </span></i>the time the contract is
concluded (perfected).   The <i><span style="">perfection </span></i>of the contract takes
place upon the concurrence of the essential elements thereof.  A contract which is <u>consensual</u> as to
perfection is so established upon a mere meeting of minds, i.e., the concurrence
of offer and acceptance, on the object and on the cause thereof.  A contract which requires, in addition to
the above, the delivery of the object of the agreement, as in a pledge or <u><span style="">commodatum</span></u><span style="">, </span>is commonly referred to as a <u><span style="">real</span></u><span style=""> </span>contract.  In a <u><span style="">solemn</span></u><span style=""> </span>contract,
compliance with certain formalities prescribed by law, such as in a donation of
real property, is essential in order to make the act valid, the prescribed form
being thereby an essential element thereof.  The stage of <i><span style="">consummation </span></i>begins
when <span style="">the parties perform their
respective undertakings under the contract culminating in the extinguishment
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Until the contract is perfected, it cannot, as an independent
source of obligation, serve as a binding juridical relation.  In sales, particularly,<span style=""> to which the topic for discussion about the
case at bench belongs, the contract is perfected when a person, called the
seller, obligates himself, for a price certain, to deliver and to transfer
ownership of a thing or right to another, called the buyer, over which the
latter agrees.  Article 1458 of the
Civil Code provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1458.  By the
contract of sale one of the contracting parties obligates himself to transfer
the ownership of and to deliver a determinate thing, and  the other to pay therefor a price certain in
money or its equivalent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When the sale is <u>not</u> <u>absolute</u> but <u>conditional</u>,
such as in <span style="">a "Contract to
Sell" where invariably the ownership of the thing sold is retained until
the fulfillment of a positive suspensive condition (normally</span>, the full
payment of the purchase price), the breach of the condition will prevent the
obligation to convey title from acquiring an obligatory force.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In <i><span style="">Dignos vs. Court of Appeals </span></i>(158
SCRA 375), we have said that, although denominated a "Deed of Conditional
Sale," a sale is still absolute where the contract is devoid of any <u>proviso</u>
that title is reserved or the right to unilaterally rescind is stipulated,
e.g., until or unless the price is paid.  Ownership will then be transferred to the buyer upon actual or
constructive delivery (e.g., by the execution of a public document) of the
property sold.  Where the condition is
imposed upon the perfection of the contract itself, the failure of the
condition would prevent such perfection.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> If
the condition is imposed on the obligation of a party which is not fulfilled,
the other party may either waive the condition or refuse to proceed with the
sale (Art. 1545, Civil Code).<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An unconditional <u>mutual</u> <u>promise</u> to buy and sell, as
long as the object is made determinate and the price is fixed, can be
obligatory on the parties, and compliance therewith may accordingly be exacted.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An <u>accepted</u> <u>unilateral</u> <u>promise</u> which <u>specifies</u>
the <u>thing</u><span style=""> </span><u>to</u><span style=""> </span><u>be</u><span style=""> </span><u>sold</u> <u>and</u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u>
<u>price</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u><span style=""> </span>paid,
<u>when</u> <u>coupled</u> <u>with</u> <u>a</u><span style=""> </span><u>valuable</u> <u>consideration</u> <u>distinct</u> and <u>separate</u>
<u>from</u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>price</u>,
is what may properly be termed a perfected contract of <u>option</u>.  This contract is legally binding, and in sales,
it conforms with the second paragraph of Article 1479 of the Civil Code, viz:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1479.  x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An accepted unilateral promise to buy or to sell a
determinate thing for a price certain is binding upon the promissor if the
promise is supported by a consideration distinct from the price.  (1451a)"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Observe, however, that the option is <u>not</u>
the contract of sale itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> The
optionee has the right, but not the obligation, to buy.  Once the option is exercised timely, i.e.,
the offer is accepted before a breach of the option, a bilateral promise to
sell and to buy ensues and both parties are then reciprocally bound to comply
with their respective undertakings.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Let us elucidate a little.  A negotiation is formally initiated by an offer.  An imperfect promise (<u>policitacion</u>)
is merely an offer.  Public
advertisements or solicitations and the like are ordinarily construed as mere
invitations to make offers or only as proposals.  These relations, until a contract is perfected, are not
considered binding commitments.  Thus,
at any time prior to the perfection of the contract, either negotiating party
may stop the negotiation.’ The offer, at this stage, may be withdrawn; the
withdrawal is effective immediately after its manifestation, such as by its
mailing and not necessarily when the offeree learns of the withdrawal <span style="">(<i>Laudico vs. Arias, 43 Phil. 270</i>).</span>  Where a period <span style="">is</span> given to the offeree within which to accept the offer, the
following rules generally govern:</p>

<blockquote>(1) If the period is not itself founded upon or supported by a
consideration, the offeror is still free and has the right to withdraw the
offer before its acceptance, or, if an acceptance has been made, before the
offeror's coming to know of such fact, by communicating that withdrawal to the
offeree (see <i>Art. 1324, Civil Code; see also Atkins, Kroll &amp; Co. vs.
Cua, 102 Phil. 948, </i>holding that this rule is applicable to a unilateral
promise to sell under Art. 1479, modifying the previous decision in <i>South
Western Sugar vs. Atlantic Gulf, 97 Phil. 249; </i>see also <i>Art. 1319, Civil
Code; Rural Bank of Parañaque, Inc., vs. Remolado, 135 SCRA 409; Sanchez vs.
Rigos, 45 SCRA 368</i>).  The right to
withdraw, however, must not be exercised whimsically or arbitrarily; otherwise,
it could give rise to a damage claim under Article 19 of the Civil Code which
ordains that "every person must, in the exercise of his rights and in the
performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe
honesty and good faith."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) If the period has a separate consideration, a contract of
"option" is deemed <u>perfected</u>, and it would be a breach of that
contract to withdraw the offer during the agreed period.  The option, however, is an independent
contract by itself, and it is to be distinguished from the projected main agreement
(subject matter of the option) which is obviously yet to be concluded.  If, in fact, the optioner-offeror <u>withdraws</u>
<u>the</u> <u>offer</u> <u>before</u> <u><span style="">its</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>acceptance</u> (exercise of the
option) by the optionee-offeree, the latter may not sue for <u>specific</u> <u>performance</u>
on the proposed contract ("object" of the option) since it has failed
to reach its own stage of perfection.  The optioner-offeror, however, renders himself liable for damages for
breach of the option.  In these cases,
care should be taken of the real nature of the <i>consideration </i>given, for
if, in fact, it has been intended to be part of the consideration for the main
contract with a right of withdrawal on the part of the optionee, the main
contract could be deemed perfected; a similar instance would be an "earnest
money" in a contract of sale that can evidence its perfection (<i>Art.
1482, Civil Code</i>).<i><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the law on sales, the so-called "right of first
refusal" is an innovative juridical relation.  Needless to point out, it cannot be deemed a perfected contract
of sale under Article 1458 of the Civil Code.  Neither can the right of first refusal, understood in its normal
concept, <u>per</u> <u>se</u> be brought within the purview of an option under
the second paragraph of Article 1479, aforequoted, or possibly of an offer
under Article 1319<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
of the same Code.  An option or an offer
would require, among other things,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> a
clear certainty on both the object and the cause or <span style="">consideration of the envisioned contract.  In a right of first refusal, while the object might be made
determinate, the exercise of the right, however, would be dependent not only on
the grantor's eventual intention to enter into a binding juridical relation
with another but also on terms, including the price, that obviously are yet to
be later firmed up.  Prior thereto, it
can at best be so described as merely belonging to a class of preparatory
juridical relations governed not by contracts (since the essential elements </span>to
establish the <u>vinculum</u> <u><span style="">juris</span></u><span style=""> </span>would still be indefinite and
inconclusive) but by, among other laws of general application, the pertinent
scattered provisions of the Civil Code on human conduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even on the premise that such right of first refusal has been
decreed under a final judgment, like here, its breach cannot justify
correspondingly an issuance of a writ of execution under a judgment that merely
recognizes its existence, nor would it sanction an action for specific
performance without thereby negating the indispensable element of consensuality
in the perfection of contracts.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> It
is not to say, however, that the right of first refusal would be
inconsequential for, such as already intimated above, <span style="">an unjustified disregard thereof, given, for instance, the
circumstances expressed in Article 19</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of the Civil Code, can warrant a recovery
for damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The final judgment in
Civil Case No. 87-41058, it must be stressed, has merely accorded a "right
of first refusal" in favor of petitioners.  The consequence of such a declaration entails no more than what has
heretofore been said.  In fine, if, as
it is here so conveyed to </span>us, <span style="">petitioners
are aggrieved by the failure of private respondents to honor the right of first
refusal, the remedy is not a writ of execution on the judgment, since there is
none to execute, but an action for damages in a proper forum for the purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, whether
private respondent Buen Realty Development Corporation, the alleged purchaser
of the property, has acted </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">good faith or bad faith and whether or not it
should, in any case, be considered bound to respect the registration of the </span><u><span style="">lis</span></u><span style=""> <u>p</u></span><u><span style="">endens</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">in
Civil Case No. 87-41058 are matters that must be independently addressed in
appropriate proceedings.  Buen Realty,
not having been impleaded in Civil Case No. 87-41058, cannot be held subject to
the writ of execution issued by respondent Judge, let alone ousted from the
ownership and possession of the property, without first being duly afforded its
day in court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We are also unable to
agree with petitioners that the Court of Appeals has erred in holding that the
writ of execution varies the terms of the judgment in Civil Case No. 87-41058,

It is well to note that when the consideration given, for what otherwise would
have been an option, partakes the nature in reality of a part payment of the
purchase price (termed as "earnest money" and considered as an
initial payment thereof), an actual contract of sale is deemed entered into and
enforceable as such.</p>

The decision referred to reads:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"In resume, there was no
meeting of the minds between the parties concerning the sale of the
property.  Absent such requirement, the
claim for specific performance will not lie.  Appellants' demand for actual, moral and exemplary damages will likewise
fail as there exists no justifiable ground for its award.  Summary judgment for defendants was properly
granted.  Courts may render summary
judgment when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law (<u>Garcia</u> <i><u>vs</u></i><u>.</u>
<u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>, 176 SCRA 815).  All requisites obtaining, the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is legally justifiable.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"WHEREFORE, finding the appeal
unmeritorious, the judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, but subject to
the following modification:  The court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> in the aforestated decision, gave the plaintiffs-<span style="">considering the mercurial and uncertain </span>forces
in our market economy today.  We find no
reason not to grant the same right of first refusal to herein appellants in the
event that the subject property is sold for a price in excess of Eleven Million
pesos.  No pronouncement as to
costs."</p>
