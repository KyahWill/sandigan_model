				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Four separate petitions of the respective parties concerned for
the review of the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 47298-R,
entitled Federation of Free Farmers, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Milling Co., Inc., et al. of <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="8">August
 12, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court held that notwithstanding the provisions of Section
9, in relation to Section 1 of the Sugar Act of 1952, Republic Act 809,
providing that of any increase in the share of the proceeds of milled sugarcane
and derivatives obtained by the planters from the centrals in any sugar milling
district in the Philippines, 60% of said increase shall correspond to and
should be paid by the planters to their respective laborers, the laborers of
the planters affiliated to the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling
District who are members of or represented by the Federation of Free Farmers,
one of herein petitioners, have not been fully paid their share thus provided
by law, corresponding to crop years 1955 to 1974, in spite of clear evidence in
the record showing that the increase of 4% in the share of the Planters, <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling District, cor­responding to all the years
since the enforcement of the aforementioned Act had already been paid by
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., Inc. to said
planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals further
found that even the shares of the laborers corresponding to crop years
1952-1955, when by operation of the Act, the increase was 10%, had not been
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court rendered
judgment holding the planters of the district and <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Milling Co., Inc. jointly and severally liable to the said laborers for all
said alleged unpaid amounts.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the four parties involved, namely, (1) the FEDERATION, (2)
the PLANTERS, as an association and on behalf of all planters in the <st1:state><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Victorias</span></st1:place></st1:state> district, (3) two
individual planters (<st1:city><st1:place>SANTOS</st1:place></st1:city> and <st1:place>TIROL</st1:place>)
as well as (4) the CENTRAL (VICTORIAS) <span class="GramE">are</span> now before
Us with their respective opposing positions relative to such decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In G.R. No.</span> L-41161, the FEDERATION
maintains that (1) the plantation laborers, its member, have not only not been
fully paid the amounts <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> due them from
crop year 1952­-1953 to November 1, 1955, during which period all the parties
are agreed that Section 1 of Republic Act 809 was fully applicable, but that
(2) in 1956, VICTORIAS and the PLANTERS had entered into an agreement which
they had no legal right to enter into the way they did, (providing for a 64-36
ratio) that is, in a manner that did not con­form with the ratio of sharing
between planters and millers specified in the just mentioned legal provision,
(which correspondingly provides for a 70-30 ratio) the FEDERATION maintaining
that after the enact­ment of Republic Act 809, all planters and millers in all
the sugar milling districts in the Philippines were deprived of the freedom to
stipulate any ratio of sharing of the proceeds of sugarcane milled by the
respective centrals, as well as their derivatives, in any proportion different
from, specially if less for the planters, than that listed in Section 1 of the
Act; and (3) assuming the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS had the legal right to enter into
any such agreement, that the 60% of the increase given to the PLANTERS under
said agree­ment has not been paid up to now to the respective laborers of said
PLANTERS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, the
FEDERATION further urges, in this instance, that the Court of Appeals' decision
is correct in holding that under the law on torts, the PLANTERS and the CENTRAL
are jointly and severally liable for the payment of the amounts thus due them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. L-41222, the contentions of petitioner VICTORIAS
are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the evidence
incontrovertibly shows that it has already paid in full to the PLANTERS their
respective shares in the proceeds of the sugarcane and derivatives milled by
said central from the moment it was legally decided and agreed that it should
do so, (aside, of course, from other issues which albeit related thereto may
need not be resolved here anymore, for reasons <span class="SpellE">hereinunder</span>
to be stated) (2) in its initial petitions in the trial court, the FEDERATION
admitted that the laborers have been given what is due them as far as the
1952-53 to 1954-55 crops are concerned, and (3) that, even if it were true that
the PLANTERS have not paid their laborers the corresponding share provided for
them by law, the facts and circumstances extant in the records do not factually
and legally justify the holding of the Court of Appeals that the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Company, Inc. is jointly and severally
liable to the laborers for what the latter's respective planters-employers
might have failed or refused to pay their laborers or which said planters might
have otherwise appropriated unto themselves or absconded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CENTRAL also posits that the action as
filed below was not founded on torts but on either an obligation created by
contract or by law, under neither of which it could be liable, and moreover,
even if such action might be deemed based on torts, it has already prescribed,
apart from the fact that since the Federation's pleadings alleged and prayed
for pay­ment of the laborers' share in 1955-56-1973-74 crop years, the Court of
Appeals had no jurisdiction to render judgment concerning the 1952-53-1954-55
crop years, the latter not having been the subject of the allegations and
prayers of the FEDERATION in its pleadings in the trial court and all evidence
regarding said matters outside of the pleaded issues were properly and
opportunely objected to.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. L-43153, the PLANTERS, aside from asserting (1) their
freedom to stipulate with the CENTRAL such ratio of sharing as they might agree
upon, regardless of the ratios specified in Section 1 of the Sugar Act, (2)
insist that their respective laborers have already been fully paid what is due
them, under the law insofar as the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years are concerned,
thereby impliedly if not directly admitting that as provided by law, the
CENTRAL or VICTORIAS had already paid them the increase they had agreed upon
and (3) that, in any event, the milling company should reimburse them whatever
amounts they might be adjudged to pay the laborers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, in G.R. No. L-43369, Planters PRIMO SANTOS and ROBERTO H.
TIROL, who are among the planters in the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
District, complain that the decision of the Court of Appeals ignored their plea
of lack of jurisdiction of the trial court over their persons in spite of their
proven claim that they had not been properly served with summons, and that the
portion of said decision holding them jointly and severally liable with
VICTORIAS and the PLANTERS to the latter's laborers for the amounts here in
question has no factual and legal basis, considering they were not parties to
the pertinent questioned agreements.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">In its petition, the FEDERATION assigns the following alleged
errors in the decision under review:</p>

<blockquote>"I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- RESPONDENT THE
HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS erred in not holding that as contended by the
Honorable Secretary of Labor, and, in effect, the Honorable Secretary of
Justice, the phrase 'written milling agreements' in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
Section 1 of Republic Act No. 809 has exclusive reference to written milling
agreements still existing upon the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
law on June 22, 1952, and, not to those executed subsequent to said date</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- RESPONDENT THE
HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS erred in not holding that the purpose and intendment
of Republic Act No. 809 is to exempt from its operation milling districts in
which there were still existing, on June 22, 1952, written milling agreements
between the majority of planters and the millers</blockquote>

<blockquote>"III - RESPONDENT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS erred in not
holding that as contended by the Honorable Secretary of Labor, and, in effect,
the Honorable Secretary of Justice, the purpose and intendment of Republic Act
No. 809, admittedly patterned after the Rice Share Tenancy Act, is to firmly
fix by law, effect­ive and, therefore, the legal effect June 22, 1952, the
sharing participation among the millers, the planters and the latter's laborers
in the unrefined sugar produced in districts not exempt, as well as all
by-products and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>derivatives thereof,
and, consequently, to prohibit in said districts written milling agreements,
executed subsequent to said date, providing for sharing arrangements different
from or contrary to the schedule fixed under said Sections 1 and 9, and, to
prevent any form of circumvention thereof</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IV - RESPONDENT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS erred in
holding that in order 'to safeguard, preserve, and maintain the integrity,
viability, and health of an industry so vital to the entire economy of the
country' as sugar industry the lawmakers intended to place in the hands of the
millers and the planters the operation of Republic Act No. 809 --- i.e. to
enable them to sti­pulate in their written milling agreements executed
subsequent to June 22, 1952 participations those prescribed in Section 1
thereof</blockquote>

<blockquote>"V - RESPONDENT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS erred in
invoking the 'Rules and Regulations to Implement Section 9 of Republic Act 809
dated February 23, 1956, as amended on May 4, 1956 (Exhibit GGG) to support its
conclusion that the lawmakers intended to place in the hands of the millers and
the planters the operation of Republic Act No. 809 --- i.e. to enable them to
stipulate in their written milling agreements executed subsequent to June 22,
1952 participations different from those prescribed in Section 1 thereof"

participa­tion on the part of the planters in the amount of 4%, on the basis of
which milling contracts the claim of the FFF, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>.
to 60% of said 4% share is founded, did not the Court of Appeals erroneously
hold, said Court acting contrary to law and to the facts and admissions of the

provided for the latter under the milling contracts, even in the absence of
allegations or evidence of acts constitut­ing tort and notwithstanding the
admitted fact that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Vicmico</span> has, since
November 1, 1955, regularly delivered to the planters, as required by law and
contract, said 4% increase in participation?</blockquote>

representing the share pertaining to the laborers from June 22, 1952 to October
31, 1955, – (a) in the face of the laborers' admission that they had received
their lawful participation during said period; (b) in the face of any lack of
allegation in the petition concerning any cause of action relative thereto; (c)
in the face of the Court of Appeals' ruling that the amicable settlement is
legal and valid; and (d) in the face of the undeniable fact that, as per the
very evidence pre­sented by the FFF, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., <span class="SpellE">Vicmico</span> delivered all the amounts pertaining to the
laborers to the planters, and the laborers actually received said amounts as

<p class="BODY">Petitioners Primo Santos and Roberto H. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>
formulate their reasons for their petition for review thus:</p>

<blockquote>"1. - The Hon. Court of Appeals failed to resolve a most
important question as to whether or not the lower court had acquired
jurisdiction over the persons of defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
Primo Santos and Roberto H. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span> due to defective
service of summons by publication.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. - The Sugar Act of 1952 (Rep. Act No. 809) may be
interpreted as not to preclude freedom of contract between the majority of the
plantation owners and the central; but the law should not later be applied only
in part as to benefit and favor the Central to the great prejudice of both the
plantation owners and the laborers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3. - Defendant Primo Santos being a mere LESSEE, not the
owner of '<span class="SpellE">Hda</span>. Kana-an', and NOT having signed any
milling contract with the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Co., he
should not be made jointly and severally liable with the central and the
plantation owners for acts and/or contracts in which he had no part nor inter­vention
whatsoever.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. - There is no evidence that the individual planters,
particularly the defendants-<span class="SpellE">movants</span> herein, had any
knowledge of nor intervention in the custody of the sum of P4,000,000 belonging
to the plantation laborers which was supposedly entrusted to a 'Special
Committee' of five (5) members; and, therefore, they (the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>)
should not be adjudged jointly and severally liable for the alleged loss of
such amount and its increments.'" (Page 7, L-43369 Rec.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing numerous assignments of error supposedly committed
by the Court of Appeals would, if all of them were to be separately considered,
call for a very extended discussion, necessarily making this opinion tediously
long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But We have repeatedly received
from all the parties motions for early resolution of these cases, which
although relatively new in this Court, were indeed started in the Court of
Agrarian Relations, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Branch, more than
eighteen (18) years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And,
considering they involve an enormous amount constituting, as it were, another
windfall for the least favored element–the farm laborers–of the once prosperous
sugar industry in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, We will limit
Ourselves to the fundamental and pivotal matters, and thus put finis, as
briefly as possible, to this important controversy together with all hardships
its long <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> has entailed for all the parties
concerned, particularly the laborers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anyway, going carefully with detailed attention over the numerous
issues raised in the so-called grounds for allowance alleged by the parties in
their respective petitions, it would be readily noted, that most of them deal
with but a few fundamental issues, some of them, already settled and
determined, as a matter of fact, by this Supreme Court, in its decision in a
related case, that of <span class="SpellE">Asociacion</span> de <span class="SpellE">Agricultores</span> de <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>,
Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> Milling Co., Inc., 88 SCRA
294, and its resolution of the motion for reconsideration thereof as reported
in 89 SCRA 311.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in its second
motion dated <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1980</st1:date>
for promulgation of decision, the FEDERATION acknowledges expressly that
"the constitutionality of the Sugar Act of 1952 as well as the
construction and interpretation thereof" have been set at rest by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the main, therefore, insofar as such basically similar and resolved issues are
concerned, <span class="GramE">We</span> shall refer to them here already as
settled juridical premises whenever it should be proper to do so in resolving
the issues in these cases.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">To set them forth briefly, among the issues in these instant
cases, which this Court has already resolved with finality in the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> case are the following:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- A -</p>

<p class="BODY">That Republic Act 809, as a social legislation founded not only
on police power but more importantly on the social welfare mandates of the
Constitution, is undoubtedly constitutional in all its aspects material and
relevant to the instant cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We deem
it would be a fruitless exercise for Us to <span class="SpellE">rediscuss</span>
and belabor that point here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, We
find the position of the Court of Appeals thereon to be well studied and
discussed and totally correct, being as they are substantially in line with the
pertinent considerations on the same point expressed in Our <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
decision.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- B -</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from upholding the constitutionality of Republic Act 809,
We further ruled in <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> that the predicate
or prerequisite of absence of milling agreements for the application of Section
1 of the Act does not refer exclusively to the expiration of the then existing
contracts (those that expired before the approval of the Act) but even to
future failure of centrals and planters to enter into written milling
contracts; that, therefore, there is nothing in the law that excludes the right
of said parties to enter into new contracts, and that in said new contracts,
they could provide for a ratio of sharing different from that stipulated in
Section 1 of the Act, provided, of course, that any increase of their share in
the proceeds of milling that the PLANTERS would get, 60% thereof must be paid
by them to their respective plantation laborers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it, therefore, to refer, insofar as said issues are
concerned, to the decision of the Court of Appeals, which We hereby uphold, and
to Our own discourse thereon as well as Our construction of Section 1 thereof
regarding the freedom of the centrals and the planters to agree on how they
would share the proceeds of the milled sugarcane made in Our decision of April
3, 1979 and resolution of February 19, 1979 earlier mentioned above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Covered here by this adoption by reference and,
therefore deemed resolved in line with <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
are the following assignments of error of the parties hereto, all of which We
have quoted at the outset of this opinion:</p>

<p class="NUM">A. I to V in the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span> brief in
G.R. No. L-41161 in Federation, etc., et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et al.;</p>

in G.R. No. L-41222 in <st1:state><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Victorias</span></st1:place></st1:state>

<p class="NUM">C. Ground A of the PLANTERS in G.R. No. L-43153 in Planters, <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling District vs. Court of Appeals, et al.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">as well as the corresponding refutations
thereof and counter-assignments of the respective parties relative to the
just-mentioned assignments of error or grounds for allowance, but none of the
points raised by petitioners in Santos and <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span> vs.
Court of Appeals, et al. G.R. No. L-43369.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">To facilitate understanding of the resolution of these cases, let
it be recalled that, as is more extensively discussed in the portions of the
decision of the Court of Appeals <span class="SpellE">hereinunder</span> to be
quoted, previous to the passage of Republic Act 809 or the Sugar Act of 1952,
almost all over the country, and particularly in the sugar milling districts of
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental, the centrals practically dominated
the economic fate of the planters and the laborers of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The common prevalent ratio of sharing of the
proceeds of the sugarcane milled by said centrals was fixed at 40% for the
centrals and 60% for the planters, both parties dealing with and paying their
respective laborers at rates which were considered subnormal, so much so that
President Manuel <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> had to appoint a committee
headed by Chief Justice Manuel Moran to investigate the economic and social
conditions in the whole sugar industry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As expected, the report recommended more effective measures to ease the
strangle­hold of the centrals over the planters, and more importantly, to
ameliorate the conditions of labor, even to the extent of utilizing police
power steps for the purpose, if needed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the above-mentioned Sugar Act came into being.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 thereof provides thus:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of written milling agreements between the majority of planters and the
millers of sugar-cane in any milling district in the Philippines, the unrefined
sugar produced in that district from the milling by any sugar central of the
sugar-cane of any sugar-cane planter or plantation owner as well as all
by-products and derivatives thereof, shall be divided between them as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Sixty per centum for the planter, and forty per centum for the
central in any milling district the maximum actual production of which is not
more than four hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That the provisions of this section
shall not apply to sugar centrals with an actual production of less than one
hundred fifty thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Sixty-two and one-half per centum for the planter, and
thirty-seven and one-half per centum for the central in any milling district
the maximum actual production of which exceeds four hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> but does not exceed six hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Sixty-five per centum for the planter, and thirty-five per centum
for the central in any milling district the maximum actual production of which
exceeds six hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> but does not
exceed nine hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Sixty-seven and one-half per centum for the planter, and
thirty-two and one-half per centum for the central in any milling district the
maximum actual production of which exceeds nine hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> but does not exceed one million two hundred thousand
<span class="SpellE">piculs</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Seventy per centum for the planter, and thirty per centum for the
central in any milling district the maximum actual production of which exceeds
one million two hundred thousand <span class="SpellE">piculs</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Complementing the above provision, Section 9 thereof provides for
a 60/40 partition between the planters and laborers (60% for the laborers and
40% for the planters) of any increase that the planters might obtain under the
Act. (Sec. 9 is quoted in the portion of the decision of the Court of Appeals
to be quoted on pages 25 and 26 hereof.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the wake of such legislation, litigations were started
questioning the constitutionality thereof, and among such cases was <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> which, as already stated, We have already
decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To reiterate, in that case, We
did not only uphold the statute's validity, We also held that the Act was not
intended to deprive the mills and the planters of the right to divide the
proceeds of the milled sugarcane in each district in the proportion they might
agree on, without regard to the ratios specified in Section 1 of the Act,
provided that any increase that the planters might be given, as expected in
consequence of the implicit compulsion of the law, has to be shared by them
with their respective laborers in their plantations, whether owned or leased by
them, in the proportion of 60% for said laborers and 40% only for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the pleadings and the briefs of
the parties in the instant cases persuades Us to rule otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, at the request of the FEDERATION, We
already had occasion to go over the main points raised by it here, when they
asked Us to consider in deciding that case their arguments in their brief filed
with the Court of Appeals, copy of which was furnished Us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of this case must then be
predicated fundamentally on the <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> rulings
insofar as they may be pertinent here.</p>

<p class="BODY">We can now, therefore, proceed to discuss the aspects of the
cases that require disquisition and disposal.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, the PLANTERS, VICTORIAS and SANTOS­-TIROL impugn
the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, 11th Regional District,
Branch I, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, in taking cognizance of this
case, with SANTOS and TIROL contending that since this is an action <u>in <span class="SpellE">personam</span></u>, service to them by publication is invalid,
hence, the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over their person; even as
VICTORIAS and PLANTERS maintain that not all the planters' members have been
properly summoned, considering that some of them were served summons only also
by publication.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not going to tarry long on these two points of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are sufficiently
convinced that, by and large, Sections 1 and 7 of Republic Act 1267, which
created the Court of Agrarian Relations, providing that:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Creation. -
For the enforcement of all laws and regulations governing the relation of
capital and labor on all agricultural lands under any system of cultivation,
there is hereby created a court of Agrarian Relations, which shall be under the
executive supervision of the Department of Justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction
of the Court. - The Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over
the entire Philippines, to consider and investi­gate, decide and settle all
questions, matters, controversies, or disputes involving all those
relationships established by law which determine the varying rights of those
persons in the cultivation and use of agricultural land where one of the
parties works the land; Provided, however, that cases pending in the Court of
Industrial Relations upon approval of the Act which are within the jurisdiction
of the Court of Agrarian Relations, shall be transferred to, and the
proceedings therein continued in, the latter court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and which was the law at the time of the
filing of the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span> suit on November 10, 1962,
contemplated the transfer from the Court of Industrial Relations, established
under Commonwealth Act No. 3, to the Court of Agrarian Relations of all
controversies of whatever nature involving agricultural laborers, particularly
those referring to the employer-employee relationship with their respective
employers, which naturally include the sugar planters and their plantation
workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. C.I.R., 3 SCRA 759.) Hence, it cannot be said that the trial court, the
Court of Agrarian Relations of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, had no
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the vital petition that spawned the instant
cases before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">V</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, considering the number of laborers involved herein, We hold
that it cannot be seriously argued that the trial court erred in holding that
the laborers and/or the FEDERATION had properly initiated their action as a
class suit, it being a matter of common knowledge that "the subject matter
of the controversy (herein) is one of common or general interest to persons ---
(so) numerous that it is impracticable to bring them all before the
court," and after all, it appears that "the parties actually before
(the trial court were) sufficiently numerous and representative, so that all
interests concerned (were) sufficiently protected." (Sec. 12, Rule 3.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the plaint of the PLANTERS that since not all the 422
individual planters named respondents in the amended petition filed below were
personally or by proper substitute form of service served with summons, the
court did not acquire jurisdiction over the persons of all the planters
concerned, suffice it to say that the record shows that at the hearing of
December 14, 1967 in the court below, there was the following clarification of
the PLANT­ERS' appearance:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. SOTO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Attys. <span class="SpellE">Sanicas</span> and Soto appearing for Planters' Association.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ATTY. SABIO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Do I understand that
Attys. Soto, <span class="SpellE">Banzon</span> and Associates represent the
members of the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Mill District Planters'
Association, Inc.?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ATTY. SOTO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Those planters who are
respondents in this case as well as planters which (sic) are not duly
represented by counsel, who are not present in court." (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. pp. 5-6)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We understand this manifestation to mean that Atty. Soto assumed
representation presumably with due authority of all the planters in the
district.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the filing of
the <span class="SpellE">FEDERA­TION's</span> petition must have been well known
or was of public knowledge in the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> milling
district and We believe that all the rest of the planters not here mentioned by
name were as much concerned as the latter and may be deemed to have felt that
all of them would eventually have the same fate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is Our impression that the
interests of all the planters concerned cannot be better presented and defended
than by how the PLANTERS have done in these cases before Us now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view whereof, We consider it rather
superfluous to cite any authorities for a holding, as We do hold, that the
persons of all the planters in the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Mill
District had been properly placed within the jurisdiction of the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Aguilos</span>
vs. Sepulveda, 53 SCRA 269.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the issues of jurisdiction just discussed may be
considered as resolved by the provisions of the law reorganizing the Courts of
Agrarian Relations, under which technical rules have hardly any force or
applicability, and considering that the acquisition of jurisdiction over the
persons of defendants is an adjective matter, this significant modification of
the procedural rules in the Court of Agrarian Relations from which these cases
originated may be given retroactive effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See Presidential Decree 946, Sec. 16.)</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VI</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the real meat of the problem before Us, which is
the question of how much money the laborers belonging to the FEDERATION should
be paid by the PLANTERS and/or VICTORIAS, corresponding to all the years from
the passage of Republic Act 809 up to November 1974 (which is the year both
parties seemingly are agreed the factual premises of further controversy among
them came to an end due to shortage of production), it should be helpful for a
deeper insight into the issues between the parties to quote pertinent portions
of the decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to said court:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 9 of the Sugar Act provides as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'SECTION 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to
the benefits granted by the Minimum Wage Law, the proceeds of any increase in
the participation granted the planters under this Act and above their present
share shall be divided between the planter and his laborer in the plantation in
the following proportion:</p>

<p class="2Q">'Sixty per centum of the increased participation for the laborers
and forty per centum for the planters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The distribution of the share corresponding to the laborers shall be
made under the supervision of the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The benefits granted to laborers in sugar plantations under this
Act and in the Minimum Wage Law shall not in any way be diminished by such
labor contracts known as 'by the piece', 'by the volume', 'by the area', or by
any other system of '<span class="SpellE">pakyaw</span>', the Secretary of Labor
being hereby authorized to issue the necessary orders for the enforcement of
this provision.'</p>

<blockquote>"The petition in the lower court alleged that, while pursuant
to Section 9 of the Act, as above quoted, 'respondents PLANTERS gave to petitioners
LABORERS the latter's participation in the sugar production as well as in the
by-products and deriva­tives thereof and continued to give the same until
November 1, 1955,' they 'ceased to do so until the present', (par. 10,
petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise charged that
'with evident intent to evade compliance with said Act and to the grave
prejudice of the laborers, some of the respondents PLANTERS and respondent
CENTRAL prepared and executed a General Collective Sugar Milling Contract
sometime in March, 1956', (par. 11, petition) the substance of which is
discussed, <u>supra</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants
forthwith prayed for a judgment:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>declaring the applicability to the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Mill District of the sharing participation prescribed by the Act, starting with
the 1955-1956 crop year; ordering Central and/or Planters to pay Appellants'
lawful share in the sugar production beginning the crop year 1955-1956, plus
legal interests thereon; awarding exemplary damages in an amount that the Court
may deem sufficient; and granting attorney's fees of 20% of whatever amount the
Appellants might be entitled to.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Denying material allegations of the petition, respondent
Central, in its answer, claims in substance that petitioners did not have any
cause of action against it since it had existing written milling agreements
with respondent Planters, and Republic Act 809 is applic­able only in the
absence of written milling agreements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As special defenses, it advanced the propositions that the lower court
had no jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the action at the time of the
filing thereof prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Land
Reform Code; that Republic Act 809 is unconstitutional; that appellant
Federation of Free Farmers has no legal authority and capacity to intervene in
the action; and that the action was not proper for a class suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise filed a counterclaim for
attorney's fees in the amount of P20,000.00, alleging that the action
instituted against it was clearly unfounded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On their part, respondent Planters, in answers filed singly
or in groups, substantially echoed Central's defenses, adding, however, that
should judgment be rendered against them, they should be entitled to
reimbursement from Central.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming jurisdiction over the action, recognizing the
personality of the respondent Federation of Free Farmers, and considering the
case as proper for a class suit, the lower court, after hearing, relying
principally on the interpretation of Section 1 of Republic Act 809 that the law
applies only in the absence of written milling agreements, dismissed the
petition, having found that written milling agreements do exist between
respondent Central and respondent Plant­ers, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision, dated December 14, 1970, reading as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING PREMISES, judgment is hereby rendered
dismissing this case as it is hereby ordered DISMISSED, without pronouncement
as to cost.'</p>

<blockquote>"The matter now before this Court is the appeal taken by the
petitioners from the decision referred to.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents Central and Planters did not interpose any appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In their appeal, appellants ventilate twenty-eight
assignments of error (pp. 67 to 77, Appellant's Brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These, however, may be reduced to the
following issues, namely:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"First:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether, as
held by the lower court, the existence of written milling agreements between
Central and Planters (Exhibits XXX thru XXX-6; YYY thru YYY-7; and SSS thru
SSS-28 and ZZZ thru ZZZ-7) renders inapplicable the operation of Republic Act
809;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Second:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether, as
appellants' claim these milling agreements have been entered into in
circumvention of Republic Act 809 and are, for that reason, void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Third:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether,
Central and Planters misappropriated money belonging to appellants amounting to
millions of pesos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We find substantial merit in the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the historical facts bearing
upon the case, we find the decision of the lower court in error.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For, historically, the facts that triggered the enactment of
Republic Act 809 and the case at bar are as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1918, 1919, and 1920, Central and Planters executed
30-year milling agreements under which the former was to receive 40% and the
latter 60% of the proceeds of sugarcane produced and milled in the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Mill District in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As early as the 1930's,
however, agitations were already made to increase the participation of the
Planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Planters sought to justify
their demands upon the claims that there was too great a disparity in profits
in favor of Central and that the increase was necessary to improve the
condition of their plantation laborers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The situation in the sugar industry at the time was such that
on February 23, 1938, President Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
appointed Chief Justice Moran of the Supreme Court as Special Investigator to
study the 'alleged inequitable distribution of sugar resulting from the milling
of sugarcane between the centrals and the plantations, with a view to
ameliorating the condition of the planters' laborers'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1939" day="30" month="4">April
 30, 1939</st1:date>, Justice Moran, in his report, verified the disparity and
observed that unless the participation of the planters <span class="GramE">were</span>
increased, they could not be made to ameliorate the condition of their
plantation laborers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moran's investigations were followed up by similar ones
conducted by the National Sugar Board created by President <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
under Executive Orders Nos. 157 and 168, and the Board's findings confirmed
those of Justice Moran's according to its report of <st1:date year="1939" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1939</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1940" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1940</st1:date>,
Commonwealth Act No. 567 took effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Noting the great disparity in the proportion of benefits 'being received
from the industry by each of its component elements', it declared it to be a
'national policy to obtain a readjustment of the benefits derived from the
sugar industry by the component elements thereof–the mill, the land­owner, the
planters of the sugarcane, and the laborers in the factory and the field'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The years during World War II may have momentarily stilled
the agitations for the increase, but during the Second Congress of the Republic
the same were resumed with vigor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Four
bills were filed, three in the House and one in the Senate, all entitled 'An
Act To Regulate the Relations between Planters and Millers of Sugarcane'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a series of amendments, the Senate
version (SB No. 138) was finally sent to President <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
who, however, vetoed the same on grounds, among others, that 'the bill contains
no provisions granting to the laborers a share in the increased participation
of the planters nor does it expressly require the latter to improve the lot of
their laborers'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1951" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1951</st1:date>,
House Bill No. 1517 (which ultimately became Republic Act No. 809) entitled 'An
Act <span class="GramE">To</span> Regulate the Relations Among Persons Engaged in
the Sugar Industry', was introduced to remedy the presidential objections to
the vetoed SB No. 138.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedy
introduced by HB No. 1517 was in the form of its Section 10 (which was amended
later to become Section 9 of Republic Act 809) providing, in essence, that 60%
of any increase in participation granted to planters under the Act 'above their
present share' should go to their plantation laborers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, Planters, on the one hand, and Central, on
the other, were locked in a tug-of-war, the former continuing the demand for
increase, the latter insisting in refusing to grant any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mean­while, a new element had entered into
the dimensions of the controversy the Planters now contended that new written
milling agreements should be concluded because their 30-year contracts with
Central had already expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Central
countered with the argument that its contracts were still in force although the
30-year period may already have run out, be­cause 6 years had to be excluded
from the computation of the 30-year period for the reason that during 4 of the
6 years, the mills were not in operation because of the Japanese occupation,
and during the last 2 years of the 6, the mills had to be reconstructed and
rehabilitated so that the mills were not in opera­tion either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the conflict continued unresolved, with
Central adamant in its position not to offer any increase in Planters'
participation the expiration of the pre­ferential treatment of sugar in the
American market was fast approaching:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>beginning <st1:date year="1954" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1954</st1:date>,
graduated customs duties were going to be taxed on Philippine sugar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was therefore, in the language of
Section 1 of the sugar bills deliberated on in Congress on <st1:date year="1950" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1950</st1:date>, a need 'to insure the maximum
utilization of the benefits of preferential treatment for the Philippine sugar
in the American market for the few remaining years'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The need for increasing the planters' partici­pation, the
approaching expiry date of the preferential treatment of Philippine sugar in
the American market, the impasse between Central and Planters despite the
termination or near termination of their 30-year written milling contracts, and
the need for Congress to step in and pass a sugar law, found expression in the
'Explanatory Note' of House Bill No. 1517 introduced on January 15, 1951, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The necessity for increasing the share of the planters and the
laborers in the income derived from the sugar industry for its stabilization is
not a new question but an admitted fact even before the outbreak of World War
II.</p>

<p class="2Q">'On February 23, 1938, President <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
on appointed Justice Manuel V. Moran to make a study of the 'distribution of
sugar resulting from the milling of sugarcane between the centrals and the
planters with a view to ameliorating the condition of the planters' laborers';
and after an exhaustive investiga­tion covering several months, Justice Moran
filed his report on April 30, 1939, recommending the increase in the
participation of sugar planters, even in violation of existing milling
contracts, contending that such a law is constitutional as a valid exercise of
the police power of the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
National Sugar Board created by Executive Orders Nos. 157 and 168, which made
another investigation of the sugar industry, in its report to the President of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1939" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1939</st1:date>, confirmed
practically the findings of Justice Moran.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Five crop years after liberation find the Philippine sugar
industry still behind its production allotment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, only three more years of preferential treatment in the
American market remain.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Serious as the situation is, it is further aggravated by the fact
that a determined struggle continues between millers and planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of the milling contracts are due to
expire next year, if they have not already done so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recently, a serious crisis faced the industry
when planters of the <span class="SpellE">Victorias-Manapla</span> district with
a quota of 1,711,235.11 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> declared a sit-down
strike, refusing to mill their canes due to the obstinate refusal of the
central to discuss terms for a new milling contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is feared that with this antecedent, the
disagreement between the millers and planters will lead to more serious
disruption of the industry and ultimately to a complete <span class="SpellE">paralization</span>
of production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispute as to the
ownership of the sugar quota has already reached our Courts.</p>

<p class="2Q">'It is therefore believed that national interest requires that
Congress should take immediate steps to save or promote an industry, which is
not only a source of livelihood for many millions of Filipinos but is also one
of our most important dollar producing industries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our country can ill afford to waste time in
long-drawn out disagreements and litigations between millers and planters with
only three more years of free American trade under the terms of the Philippine
Trade Act of 1946.</p>

<p class="2Q">'The present bill seeks to avoid fatal controversies in the sugar
industry by determining the respective share of millers and sugar-cane planters
in the absence of milling agreements, on the pattern set by the Rice Share
Tenancy Act, the constitu­tionality of which has been already upheld and on the
basis of the declarations of emergency and national interest made in Act No.
4166.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commonwealth Act No. 567, and
Republic Act No. 279.</p>

<p class="2Q">'This bill is also in harmony with the recommendation of the Bell Report
for the improvement of the living condition of the laboring class by providing
higher wages <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This bill does not violate existing milling
agreements between planters and millers of sugar-cane as its provisions are
only applicable in the absence of such milling contracts.'</p>

<blockquote>"Notwithstanding the facts faithfully reflected in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> 'Explanatory Note' to HB 1517, Central and
Planters still had not entered into new written milling contracts, and there
were no pros­pects that such contracts would soon be entered into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, on <st1:date year="1952" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1952</st1:date>, Planters went to court in Civil Case No.

rendered declaring their 30-year written milling agreements with Central terminated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under this air of extreme uncertainty and necessity, Congress
approved HB 1517 to become law as Republic Act 809 on <st1:date year="1952" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1952</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under this law, Planters claimed, the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Mill District fell in the category of districts producing 1,200,000 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> or more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
prescription of its Section 1, Central would have a share of 30% and Planters,
70%.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, before <st1:date year="1952" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1952</st1:date>, Planters had a participation of
only 60% while Central had 40%, and since, under their contention, their
30-year milling contracts had already expired, Planters demanded that Central,
pursuant to the new law, give them an increase equivalent to 10% over their
previous 60% participation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1952" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1952</st1:date>,
however, Central replied to Planters (Exhibit N-14):</blockquote>

 25, 1952</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="2Q">'We reiterate our opinion that our milling contracts have not yet
expired, and that we are under no obligation to deliver to the planters the
increased participation of 70% provided in the Sugar Act of 1952.</p>

<p class="2Q">'On the other hand, there is pending in the Court of First Instance
of Manila (Case No. 16815), the action instituted by you against our Company
for a declaratory judgment as to whether or not our milling contracts have
already expired.</p>

<p class="2Q">'In view of the foregoing, we suggest matters be held in abeyance
until final judgment is rendered in the said case No. 16815.'</p>

1952, set aside a 'reserve' of 10% as a precautionary measure to take care of
Planters' demand just in case it had to give that 10% increase</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Central, however, did not actually give it to
Planters; it merely set it aside for future disposition, 'because', explained
Central's treasurer-comptroller, 'apparently there was no milling contract at
that time and the company was afraid to incur liability under Republic Act 809
and therefore the company set aside every year 10%' (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,

nothing going to the plantation laborers, as being contrary to Section 1 of

<p class="BODY">Before proceeding any further, and in order to place in proper
perspective the matters covered by the numerous assignment of errors presented
by the parties for Our resolution, We believe We must underscore at this point
that as may be readily noted in the portion of the decision under review We
have just quoted, the Court of Appeals summed up the allegations of the
petition (and presumably the amended one) filed with the trial court and stated
unqualifiedly the premise that, per its own petition the Federation admitted
that the laborers' share in the 1952-53 to 1954-55, "<u>the PLANTERS gave
to petitioners LABORERS the <span class="SpellE">latters</span>' participation in
the sugar production as well as in the by-products and derivatives thereof and
continued to give the same until November 1, 1955, etc</u>." (Underlining
Ours) Then the Court proceeded to state the defenses of the defendants PLAN­TERS
and CENTRAL or VICTORIAS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And after
quoting the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the trial court's
judgment, the Court went on to say that appellants (meaning the laborers
represented by the FEDERATION) ventilate twenty-eight assignment of errors
giving rise, in that Court's view to the three issues it enumerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(supra) The point We want to clarify as early
as at this juncture is that it is at once evident that technically, the second
and third issues referred to cannot be deemed to contemplate any question
beyond those raised in the petition, namely, the non-payment of the laborers'
share in the proceeds of production after November 1, 1955.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever, therefore, might have been covered
by the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span> twenty eight assignment of errors
in respect to matters before November 1, 1955 were obviously new matter, and
could be resolved by the Appellate Court only if evidence thereon were received
by the trial court without objection of the adverse parties seasonably as if
the same were tried with by agreement of all the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have to make this early elucidation and setting of the proper
perspective of the issues, because, as will be seen later, one of the decisive
considerations We will dwell on will be whether or not the Appellate Court
legally acquired authority to act on said new matter and/or whether or not it
resolved the issues of fact and law relative thereto in accordance with the
evidence and the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hereunder is how
the Court of Appeals, resolved the three issues that it held came out from the
assignment of errors of appellant Federation.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VII</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court resolved the three issues it enumerated as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the first issue, the Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"We agree that millers and planters may indeed enter into
written milling agreements stipulating participations different from those
prescribed in Section 1 of the Sugar Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This conclusion is justified by the language of Section 1 itself which
declares that –</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In the absence of written milling agreements between the majority
of the planters and the millers of sugarcane in any milling district in the
Philippines, the unrefined sugar produced in that district.... shall be divided
between them.'</p>

<blockquote>in the proportions established
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The phrase 'in the absence of
clearly indicates that the division of the sugar between the millers and the
planters in accordance with the schedule of participations mentioned, has to be
complied with only during periods when millers and planters are bound by no
written milling agreements, and need not govern the sharing system of the
contracting parties who have entered into such agreements.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That this is the real intendment of the law can hardly be
shrouded in doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the law is not
merely social in that it means to uplift the wretched condition of the laborers
in the country's sugarcane plantations; it is also economic in that the law is
calculated to safeguard, preserve, and maintain the integrity, viability, and
health of an industry so vital to the entire economy of the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the sugar bill (which ultimately became
Republic Act 809) was being debated in Congress in 1950, 1951, and 1952, one of
the urgent reasons advanced by its sponsors in plead­ing for the expeditious
passage of the measure was the fact that in a year or so the preferential
treatment of Philippine sugar in the American market was expiring, and it was
imperative that the situation in the sugar industry be stabilized as quickly as
possible by the passage of the bill in order to take advantage of the remaining
few years of such preferential treatment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The provisions of the law authorizing the take-over by the government of
centrals which refuse to mill or of plantations which neglect to plant,
indicate the concern of the industry to the over-all posture of the national
economy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respective partici­pations
of the millers and the planters cannot, therefore, be regulated, at all times,
by the same proportions established in Section 1 of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, such participations should
be understood as subordinated, at all times, to the superior interests of the
industry as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one, least of all
the very people involved in the industry – millers, planters, and laborers –
has a right, so to speak, 'to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.'
Particularly when production costs are so high and sales are so low, sacrifice
on the part of everyone is in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
such cases, millers and planters should be able to adjust their respective
participations in response to the economic realities obtaining in the industry,
that is, stipulate in their written milling agree­ments participations lower or
higher than those prescribed in Section 1 of the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fears may be expressed, as a result of the conclusion we have
reached, that millers and planters may be thrown back into the same situation
that the Sugar Act was passed to remedy–that is, a situation where the weak
planters would be continually demanding an increase in their partici­pation and
the strong millers would persist in refusing to grant the increase, the same
stalemate, in the same impasse that characterized the relations between Central
and Planters before the Act became law and which, in fact, precipitated the
enactment of the law in 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
fears, however, may not be seriously enter­tained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A continuing period of no-contract would
result in a definite disadvantage to the centrals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 provides summary increases dictated
by Section 1 would continue to accrue in favor of the planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons of sheer self-interest,
therefore, the centrals would thus be compelled to negotiate written contracts
with the planters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In such a situation, the planters, understandably would not
be in too great hurry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, however, they
must write new contracts with the millers, there is hardly any doubt that,
after enjoying the increases as decreed in Section 1 of the law in the absence
of written milling agreements they would not yield to less in negotiating new
milling agreements with the millers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proof of this is the fact, in the instant <span class="GramE">case, that</span>
Planters, enjoying a 4% increase in their participation by virtue of Section 1
when they had no milling agreements with Central, did not settle for less when
they finally executed the ASCA with Central on <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1956</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But we disagree with <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> when
they assert that plantation laborers have no right to any share in any increase
in planters' participation where such increase is granted not 'under this Act'
(a phrase used in Section 9 of the law) but by contract, as in the case of the
ASCA of March 5, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument
loses sight of the fact that the Sugar Act of 1952 is, by and large, a piece of
social legislation intended to grant increases in the planters' participation
for the primary purpose of enabling the planters to improve the lot of their
plantation laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in 1938, when
President Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> appointed Chief Justice
Moran to study the 'alleged inequitable distribution of sugar resulting from
the milling of sugarcane between the centrals and the plantation', the study
was undertaken with a view to 'ameliorating the condition of the plan­ters'
laborers'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Justice Moran finally
submitted his report on <st1:date year="1939" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1939</st1:date>,
he came up with the conclusion that unless the participation of the planters
was increased, they could not be made to 'ameliorate the condition of their
plantation laborers.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court then went into an extended discussion of practically
the same considerations discussed by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>, hence We will not quote them anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We did in <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>,
the Court concluded:</p>

<blockquote>"In keeping with this spirit, the Department of Labor has made
a correct interpretation of the scope and extent of the applicability of
Republic Act 809 in respect to the benefits of plantation laborers, in issuing
the 'Rules and Regulations to Implement Section 9 of Republic Act 809 (Exhibit
GGG), dated February 23, 1956, as amended on May 4, 1956, providing:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'SECTION 1, The benefits granted to laborers under the Act shall
apply to all laborers of sugar plantations in any milling district wherein the
planters' share has increased in accordance with the schedule of participations
established in Section 1 of said Act, due either to the absence or expiration
of written milling agreements between the majority of the planters and their
respective millers or under subsequent milling agreements executed after the
date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Act.'</p>

<blockquote>"It is clear from the foregoing provisions of the 'Rules and
Regulations', that the benefits to which the plantation laborers are entitled
refer to the increases in planters' participation granted either under Section
1 of the law (in the absence of written milling agreements on the date said law
became effective, June 22, 1952) or under any subsequent contracts executed
after the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the said Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is likewise clear that such increase is the difference
determined, as basis, either on the lower participation of the planter under
the last milling contract expired immediately prior to June 22, 1952, or on the
lower participation of the planter under a milling contract which, although
subsisting on that date, expired immediately thereafter, in relation either to
the higher participation of the planter under Section 1 of the law (in the
absence of a milling contract) or to the higher participation of the planter
under a milling agreement executed subsequent to June 22, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, provides the 'Rules and Regulations' –</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Increase in participation shall mean the difference between the
participation of the planters under Section 1 of the Act or the participation
of the planters in any mil­ling agreement subsequent to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the Act, and the participation of said planters under the milling contract
subsisting at the date of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Act,
or in the absence thereof, under the last milling contract immediately prior to
the enactment of said Act.'</p>

<blockquote>"Consequently, we hold that, since, as the facts of this case
show, under their milling contracts which expired before June 22, 1952,
Planters had a participation of 60%, while Central had 40%, and since, under
the ASCA executed between them on March 5, 1956, but made retroactive to
November 1, 1955, Planters have a participation of 64% while Central has 36%, with
such participations to run and remain in force until October 31, 1974, Planters
enjoy a 4% increase in participation under the said ASCA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to Section 9 of Republic Act 809,
the plantation laborers, or appellants herein, are entitled to a share of 60%
of such 4% increase during the entire period of the 19-year term of the ASCA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of all the foregoing, we hold, in disposing of
the first issue herein discussed, that the existence of milling agreements does
not necessarily render Republic Act 809 inapplicable or inoperative as to the
contracting parties but the Act remains applicable and operative in all cases
where the milling agreements, executed subsequent to June 22, 1952, provide any
increase in planters' participation, as the term 'increase in participation' is
defined herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, the ASCA and the other derivative sugar milling
contracts are hereby declared modified so as to be caused to be read <span class="SpellE">thereinto</span> a provision granting the plantation laborers, or

<p class="BODY">Anent the second issue, the Court discoursed thus:</p>

<blockquote>"We shall now take up the second issue under which appellants
claim that the ASCA of March 5, 1956 (Exhibits XXX thru XXX-6), and derivative
contracts, the 'General Collective Sugar Milling Contract' (Exhibits YYY thru
YYY-7) and the 'Individual Sugar Milling Contract' (Exhibits SSS thru SSS-28
and ZZZ thru ZZZ-7) executed by Central, on the one hand, and Planters, on the
other, have been entered into in circumvention of Republic Act 809 and are, for
that reason, void <span class="SpellE">ab</span> <span class="SpellE">initio</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In their twelfth assignment of error (appellants' brief, pp.
265-278), appellants argue that while <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are
free to enter into written milling agreements subsequent to June 22, 1952, the
intent of Republic Act 809 is that the provisions of such agreements 'must be
without prejudice to the sharing arrangement laid down in Sections 1 and 9' of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this position,
they cite the proceedings on the deliberations of the Senate on House Bill No.
1517 (which ultimately became Republic Act 809) particularly on what became
Section 5 of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their sixteenth
assignment of error (appellants' brief, pp. 292-306), appellants charge that
the motive of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in executing the milling
agreements is 'to have a pretext for evading and circumventing Sections 1 and 9
of Republic 809 and thereby to be able to appropriate with impunity the six
(6%) per cent share' of appellants in the unrefined sugar and its derivatives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We have gone over the arguments of appellants in both
assignments of error but found no evidence of circumvention as appellants have
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under their twelfth assignment
of error, it is true that Senator <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span> introduced
an amendment so as to subject the schedule of participations under Section 1 of
the law to decisions by a proposed Board of Arbitration to be appointed by the
President of the Philippines 'in the event that any central, shall be unable to
arrive at a milling agreement with a majority of the planters affiliated with
it, and shall refuse to mill the sugar cane of such plant­ers in the absence of
such agreement', and that this amendment was voted down on the ground, strongly
advocated by Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span>, that since the bill already
fixed the ratio of participation between the millers and the planters, it would
be wrong to 'open it to further inquiry or arbitration.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> was correct in
taking such position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no point
to creating a Board of Arbitration to determine the participations of the
millers and the planters which the bill under discus­sion had already fixed as
a congressional determination of the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But no inference may be drawn from Senator <span class="SpellE">Tañada's</span>
position that the sharing proportions established under Section 1 of the law
may not be deviated from in contracts executed subsequent to the passage of the
law on June 22, 1952.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> are correct in their view that indeed if it were
the intention of Congress for the millers and planters to observe no other
sharing arrangements than those established under Section 1, there would be
little point, if at all, entering into any written milling agreements which
cannot stipulate other proportions in the sharing arrangements than those
prescribed under Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our resolution
of the first issue, we adverted to the fact that Re­public Act 809, although
not a revenue-raising measure, is, in addition to being social, also an
economic piece of legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears
repeating in connection with the issue at hand that Congress could not have intended,
by Section 1, to prevent the millers and planters from agreeing to other
sharing proportions, even at the cost of the preservation of the sugar
industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe we need say
more.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under their sixteenth assignment of error, appellants cite
the various acts of Central in resorting to maneuvers to get Planters to
execute the ASCA of <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1956</st1:date>,
and the other derivative sugar milling agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants are of the view that they are
entitled to 6% of the sugar proceeds effective June 22, 1952 without contract,
as under Section 1 of the law, or with contract, as under the ASCA, and that
the maneuvers of Central in offering the Planters 64%, provided Central got
36%, which the latter finally succeeded getting the former to agree to under
the ASCA, constitute a circumvention of the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Central's tactics may not be exactly moral, but they are
standard operating procedure of businesses–using every possible leverage and
device to bring about the best bargain under given circumstances–for
profit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contracts, therefore, which
it wrung from Planters are not in circumvention of the law but in legitimate
pursuit of profit–which is the end-all and be-all of business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Central, as a result of the ASCA which
appellants claim it (Central) to have 'engineered', got 36% and Planters 64%,
while the plantation laborers got nothing, is no reason for considering the
contract a circumvention of the law which does not in the first place impose
upon it any duty or require of it the performance of any obligation to yield any
part of its participation in favor of planters laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, we do not find in Central's
conduct in the premises anything so odious or so obnoxious as to render the
contracts it has entered into with Planters illegal or repugnant to public policy</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of negotiations, Central acted
under the belief that if it succeeded in writing new written milling
agreements, the agreements could stipulate other proportions in the sharing
system than those established under Section 1 of the law, since in its view,
the law would no longer be applicable the moment such agreements were entered
into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is evidence that Planters,
on their part, at first recoiled from Central's suggestion that the latter was willing
to increase the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> participation from 60% to
64% provided Planters agreed to give 36% to Central for the duration of the
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sense of repulsion was
understandable, since, under Central's suggestion, the 6% which the Planters'
laborers were to enjoy from <st1:date year="1952" day="22" month="6">June 22,
 1952</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1955" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1955</st1:date>,
would all go to Central during the next 19 years, from <st1:date year="1955" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1955</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1974" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But Planters seemed to have little choice as Central appeared to have
all the aces:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from June 22, 1952, it had
started setting aside a 'reserve' equivalent to 10% of the annual production,
this being the amount of increase which the Planters had demanded as due to
them under Section 1 of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although Central still insisted, even after the passage of the law on
June 22, 1952, that its 30-year milling contracts with Planters had not yet
expired because of its belief that 4 years of Japanese occupation and 2 years
of rehabilitation of the mills during which the mills were not in operation
should be deducted from the 30-year periods of the contracts, it set aside this
'reserve' just in case it was finally decided by the courts before which the
issue had been brought by the planters, that its 30-year contracts had indeed
expired as of the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>As of October
31.</u></span><u> 1955, <span class="GramE">this<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'reserve'</span> had accumulated to P8,643,472.24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Central's suggestion was that this amount of
'reserve' built up during the period from June 22, 1952, to October 31, 1955,
be divided between Planters and the plantation laborers on the proportion of
40% for the former and 60% for the latter, the same proportions prescribed by
Section 9 of Republic Act 809.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With 40%
of the 'reserve', Planters would stand to get P3<span class="GramE">,457,388.90</span>,
while the plantation laborers, with 60% would have P5,186,083.34.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These participations in the 'reserve' of 40%
for Planters and 60% for the plantation laborers in the 'reserve', would be
equivalent to participations of 4% and 6%, respectively, in the total annual</u>
production within the period from June 22, 1952 to October 31, 1955, Planters'
total participation for the period, therefore, would be 64%.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Confronted by an acute need for money and these enticements
dangled before them P3,457,388.90 in cash (equivalent to 40% of their
participation in the reserve or to 4% in the total annual production) for the
period June 22, 1952 to October 31, 1955, and a similar total participation of
64% for the next 19 years, that is, from November 1, 1955 to October 31, 1974,
coupled by the speculation perhaps that their 4% increase for the 19 years could
not be touched by the plantation laborers because of the argument that Republic
Act 809 would no longer be applicable once written milling agreements were
entered into, Planters found no better alternative than sign, as they did sign,
on March 5, 1956, the controversial ASCA and subsequently, the other agreements
reproducing the provisions of the ASCA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>That Planters might not have gotten the better end of the
bargain since, under the ASCA, the 6% that would go to their plantation
laborers for the period from June 22, 1952 to October 31,1955, would go instead
to Central for the next 19 years, from Novem­ber 1, 1955 to October 31, 1974,
is no evidence of circumvention of Republic Act 809.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have said in our resolution of the
first issue, the millers and planters may stipulate in their written milling
agreements other sharing proportions than those prescribed in Section 1 of the
law which were so prescribed only in the absence or because of the absence of
written milling agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Centrals'
drive, therefore, to get all the 6% for itself is a perfectly legitimate one,
not a circumvention</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, fundamentally, the above position of the Court of Appeals
is in accord with <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>, except for some
apparent incon­sistencies therein, to which <span class="GramE">We</span> will <span class="SpellE">hereinunder</span> address Ourselves re­garding the conduct of <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
in entering into the so-called ASCA. It is quite obvious that the Appellate
Court tried very hard to look for some way of making VICTORIAS somehow liable
for whatever might be due the laborers of the PLANTERS, notwithstanding its
categorical finding and holding that VICTORIAS did nothing more than to obtain
as legitimate a bargain as any sensible businessman or industrialist having an
eye for profit would do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see no
legal, equitable nor moral reason for such effort, even as We reaffirm for the
purposes of the instant cases, Our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
that under no circumstances should the plantation laborers be deprived of 60%
of whatever increase in share their respective planters-employers had obtained
from the Central, that is, whether by the application of Section 1 of the Act
when there were not enough written contracts, or, under the said contracts upon
there being a majority of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">After holding that the ASCA is legal and, what is more, not
conceived to circumvent the law, surprisingly, the Court went into a matter not
alleged in the petitions in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It proceeded to go into a disquisition of the effects of the provi­sions
of the ASCA regarding the manner of paying the share of the laborers in the 10%
increase of the PLANTERS' share from <st1:date year="1952" day="22" month="6">June
 22, 1952</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1955" day="31" month="10">October 31,
 1955</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As will be noted in
the earlier quoted provisions of the ASCA, it was stipulated that the PLANTERS
would be paid their 10% increase, 60% of which would pertain to the laborers,
with the condition, however, that instead of the PLANTERS receiving the total
share of the laborers in cash, only a portion would be in cash and the balance
of Four Million (P4M) Pesos would be in the form of certificates of shares of
stock to be issued to the PLANTERS, who formed a Special Committee or Board of
Trustees for the purpose, expressly in trust for the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court condemned such provisions as
entirely beyond the authority of the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS to stipulate just
between them without the express consent or prior assent of the laborers or the
Federation or even the Secretary (now Minister) of Labor, who, under Section 9
of the Act, was supposed to super­vise "the distribution of the share
corresponding to the laborers." On such premises, the Court concluded:</p>

<blockquote>"In the light of all the foregoing, we hold, in resolution of
the second issue, that, while we do not find <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
to have circumvented Republic Act 809 in entering into the ASCA and in
stipulating a participation of 64% for Planters and 36% for Central, and for
this reason, declare the ASCA and the other derivative sugar milling contracts
valid, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are jointly and severally liable
for tort in disposing, upon their own accord, and without any authority of the
plantation laborers, of the money of the said laborers in the total amount of
P5,186,083.34, and in thus causing the loss of shares of stock and their
earnings purchased out of the P4,000,000.00 of such amount."</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">X</p>

<p class="BODY">While, as We have said, We are in agreement with the Court of
Appeals in its construction and application of Sections 1 and 9 of Republic Act
809 as discussed above, We cannot, as We will show anon, fully accept its
conclusions as to the pretended liability of the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS for the
amount that the FEDERATION claims the laborers of the PLANTERS have not been
paid as their share of the proceeds of the crop years 1952-1953 to 1954-1955 as
well as those of the crop years 1956-1957 to 1973-1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In passing upon, as We have just quoted, the
second issue form­ulated by it to resolve the appeal to it of the Federation,
it held the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the PLANTERS (including Primo
Santos and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>) and VICTORIAS
"jointly and severally liable for tort in disposing, upon their own
accord, and without any authority of the plantation laborers, of the money of
the said laborers in the total amount of P5,186,083.34 and thus causing the
loss of shares of stock and their earnings purchased out of P4,000,000.00 of
such amount." Not only that, the Court of Appeals adjudged the PLANTERS
and VICTORIAS also jointly and severally liable for the 2.4% share of the
laborers in the proceeds, which they maintain they have not received, of the
crop years 1956-57 to 1973-74.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In­deed,
in the course of resolving the second issue and in disposing of the third
issue, the Appellate Court found the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS guilty of
misappropriation and conversion of P7<span class="GramE">,385,950.00</span>
corresponding to the P4M worth of <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
shares of stock which under the ASCA was stipulated to be received by the
PLANTERS in trust for the laborers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, this particular aspect of these instant cases before <span class="GramE">Us</span> involve questions both of fact and of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To put things in their proper order and to
pin liability for the claim of the laborers on the proper party or parties, it
would be best to discuss and dispose of separately the two stages of sharing
and payment in question, namely, (1) that which refers to the proceeds of the
1952­-53 to 1954-55 crop years and (2) that referring to the proceeds from crop
year 1955-56 to crop year 1973-74.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- A -</p>

<p class="BODY">We will start with what We feel is the stage that involves
factual and legal issues which may be easily and readily determined, which is
that referring to the proceeds of 1955-56 to 1973-74 crop years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the ASCA, the ratio of
sharing between the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS during that period was to be 64% of
said proceeds for the former and 36% thereof for the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Supreme Court held in <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> and as held in the decision of the Court of
Appeals under review, We reiterate, it is indubitable that said proportion of
sharing is legal, the ratios fixed in Section 1 of Republic Act 809
notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although nothing is
provided in the ASCA as to the share of the laborers in the 4% increase the
PLANTERS were thus given by VICTORIAS, which under <span class="SpellE">Talisay?Silay</span>
and the decision of the Court of Appeals ought to be 2.4%, or 60% of said 4%,
it is admitted on all sides that VICTORIAS religiously gave the PLANTERS their
full increase of 4% annually from crop year 1955-56 to crop year 1973-74
thereby leaving it to the PLANTERS to pay their respective laborers the said
2.4%.</p>

<p class="BODY">The FEDERATION claims and the Court of Appeals so found that the
laborers were not paid by their respective planters?employers what is
legally due them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case,
We cannot but affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that the PLANTERS are
liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- B -</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot, however, share the Appellate Court's holding that <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
is jointly and severally liable with the PLANTERS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot perceive any factual or legal basis
for such <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the very beginning of the sugar
industry, the centrals have never had any <span class="SpellE">privity</span> of
any kind with the plantation laborers, since they had their own laborers to
take care of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, both the
centrals and the planters have always been the one dealing with their
respective laborers regarding the terms and condition of their employment,
particularly, as to wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in
Republic Act 809 can <span class="GramE">We</span> find anything that creates any
relationship between the laborers of the planters and the centrals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of said Act, the old practice
of the centrals issuing the <span class="SpellE">quedans</span> to the respective
PLANTERS for their share of proceeds of milled sugar per their milling
contracts has not been altered or modified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the language of the Act does not in any manner make the
central the insurer on behalf of the plantation laborers that the latter's
respect­ive employers-planters would pay them their share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had the legislature intended to make the
central as such insurer, <span class="GramE">We</span> have no doubt that clear
words to such effect would have been used.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Much less is there in the ASCA any provision making <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
responsible in any way for the share due the plantation laborers in the 4%
obtained by the PLANTERS under said agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 9 of the Act unequivocally provides that 60% of "the
proceeds of any increase in the participation granted the planters under this
Act and above their present share <u>shall be divided between the planter and
his laborer</u>." Further, the same provision explicitly mandates that the
''distribution of the share corresponding to the laborers shall be made under
the supervision of the Department of Labor." Accordingly, the only
obligation of the centrals, like <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>,
is to give to the respective planters, like the PLANTERS herein, the planters'
share of the proceeds of the milled sugar in the proportion stipulated in the
milling contract which would necessarily include the portion of 60% pertaining
to the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Once
this has been done, the central is already out of the picture, and thereafter,
the matter of paying the plantation laborers of the respective planters becomes
the exclusively the concern of the planters, the laborers and the Department of
Labor.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under no principle of law
or equity can <span class="GramE">We</span> impose on the central – here <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
– any liability to the planta­tion laborers, should any of their respective
planters-employers fail to pay their legal share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, since, under the law, it is the
Department of Labor which is the office directly called upon to supervise such
payment, it is but reasonable to maintain that if any blame is to be fixed for
the unfortunate situation of the unpaid laborers, the same should principally
be laid on the planters and secondarily on the Department of Labor, but surely,
never on the central.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- C -</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, when We consider that according to their own petitions,
both original and amended in the court below, the laborers had not been paid
their share since after the 1954-55 crop year, and their original petition was
filed only in November 1962, We feel inclined to believe that if the laborers
were convinced that they had any kind of cause of action against VICTORIAS, it
is quite unexplainable why it took them practically more than six years to file
their suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is just as remarkable
that they did not move even against their very employers, the PLANTERS, during
all that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, as <span class="GramE">We</span> have already stated, We find no legal nor equitable basis
for the pretended joint and several or <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
liability of <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state> with the
PLANTERS to the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its act of
paying the PLANTERS the full 4% increase was not illegal or contrary to law,
for it was in fact in fulfillment of its obligation both under Our <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> ruling and the provisions of the ASCA.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- D -</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, it may be added, the Rules and Regulations to
implement Section 9 of Republic Act 809, "issued by the Secretary of Labor
on February 23, 1956, as amended on May 4, 1956, do provide pertinently that
the laborers' share in the increase in participation accruing to the planters
shall be included in the <span class="SpellE">quedans</span> covering said
increase <u>issued in the planters' name</u> with the following notation on the
face of the <span class="SpellE">quedan</span> sixty per centum (60%) share of
laborers in the increase in the participation of planters under Sugar Act of
1952 included." But absent any iota of evidence indicating that such was
not done, We are under the law supposed to presume that the regulations have
been complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the
Federation's unusually lengthy and prolific brief is there any indication
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And whatever the respective
PLANTERS did after those <span class="SpellE">quedans</span> were issued to them
cannot under any concept of law or equity <span class="GramE">be</span> imputed
to <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state> or to any imaginable
conni­vance between it and the PLANTERS to prejudice the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing that <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
could conceivably gain in any such nefarious arrangement to induce it to take
the risk of ultimate being made liable in the manner done by the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indeed noteworthy that whereas, as We shall discuss
presently, with regard to the payment of the laborers' share in the proceeds of
the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years (60% of 6% out of the 10% provided in Section
1 of Republic Act 809), the Court of Appeals rather extensively argued and
discoursed, with, to be sure, seeming or apparent plausibility what
considerations, in its view, ought to make VICTORIAS, jointly and severally or <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with the PLANTERS,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
hardly did said Court lay down any premise for the following portion of its
judgment now under review:</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring that the
participation of 64% for Planters and 36% for Central commencing from November
1, 1955 to October 31, 1974, as stipulated in these written milling agreements,
is valid, but that there should be deemed written into said agreements a

following:</p>

<blockquote>"In the light of all the foregoing, we hold, in disposing of
the first issue herein discussed, that the existence of milling agreements does
not neces­sarily render Republic Act 809 inapplicable or inoperative as to the
contracting parties but the Act remains applicable and operative in all cases
where the milling agreements, executed subsequent to June 22, 1952, provide any
increase in planters' participation, as the term 'increase in participation' is
defined herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, the ASCA and the other deriva­tive sugar milling
contracts are hereby declared modi­fied so as to be caused to be read <span class="SpellE">thereinto</span> a provision granting the plantation laborers, or
the appellants here­in, 60% of the 4% increase in planters' participation
stipulated therein, commencing from <st1:date year="1955" day="1" month="11">November

be entitled to legal interest for the same period." <span class="GramE">(Page
49, id.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Well and good, but the Appellate Court did not say that with such
construction it had made of the Act, (to be sure, in accord with <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>) it became the obligation of VICTORIAS to see
to it that the respective laborers of the PLANTERS were duly paid their share
of 2.4% or 10% of the 4% increase the PLANTERS were given.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing judgment becomes more incomprehensible when it is
recalled that in its minute analysis of the ASCA insofar as the provisions
thereof stipulating a 64%-36% sharing between the PLANTERS and the CENTRAL of
the proceeds of milled sugar during crop years 1955-56 to 1973-74, it found
that in so stipulating such ratio of sharing in said ASCA, there was no
evidence at all that on the part of VICTORIAS–and the PLANTERS, for that matter
of any circumvention, and We can add, even of any intent to circumvent, the
provisions of the Section 1 of the Act, To Our mind, for the Appellate Court to
impose upon VICTORIAS joint and several liability with the PLANTERS, in the
light of its just quoted predicates, for the latter's failure to pay their
respective laborers the 2.4% corresponding to said workers, is not only a
veritable <u>non-sequitur</u> but an utterly baseless legal conclusion that
cannot be allowed to stand uncorrected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, it is Our considered opinion, and We so hold, that the
portion of the judgment of the Court of Appeals just quoted should be as it is
hereby REVERSED, and whatever liability there exists in favor of the plantation
laborers should be pinned exclusively on the PLANTERS, their respective
employers. We must add though, that it was the Department of Labor's
unexplainable inattention, not to say negligence, in performing its own
corresponding obligations under Section 9 of the Act that contributed to a
considerable extent to the sad plight that befell the said laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was perceptible lack of sufficient
concern and initiative, to say the least, in the Department's attitude and
actuations in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be
said that its vigilance concerning the rights of labor was unhappily not up to
the expectations of the lawmakers when they approved the Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the matter of the liabilities relative to the share of the
laborers in the proceeds of the 1955-56 to 1973-74 crop years thus Clarified
and determined, We can now pass to what happened to the participation due the
laborers during the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, this is an inquiry that involves both
issues of fact and of law.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- A -</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, let us hearken first to how the Court of
Appeals made its conclusions of fact in respect to P5,185,083.34 that it found
to be the unpaid share of the laborers before the execution of the ASCA:</p>

<blockquote>"In resolving the third and last issue set forth above, we
have taken note of appellants' position that Central and Planters are guilty of
'misappropria­tion' of the amount of P5,185,083.34 belonging to them which
accrued during the period from June 22, 1952, to October 31, 1955 as their 60%
share of Planters 10% increase in participation totaling, during the same
period, P8, 643,472.24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What will now be
resolved, therefore, is whether or not appellants have, in fact, received this
amount of P5,185,083.34.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By way of a short flashback, it is to be recalled that the
laborers' P5,185,083.34 was, under the ASCA, to be disposed of as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P1,186,083.34 was to be distributed to the
laborers, under the supervision of the Secretary of Labor, and P4,000,000.00
was to be invested in Central's shares of stock.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may be pertinent, at this point, to make a brief reference
to the mechanics of this investment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
provided in the ASCA, the P4,000,000.00 of the P5,185,083.34 belonging to the
appellants-laborers was to be invested in 40,000 shares of Central's capital
stock (with par value of P100.00 per share) redeemable after a period of time
by Central.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This investment was to be
administered by the 'Special Committee'; designated in the ASCA as representa­tive
of Planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>On August 13, 1956,
pursuant to the ASCA of March 5, 1956, Central issued the 40,000 shares in four
certificates of 10,000 shares each, in the names of five members of the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Special Committee' or 'Board of Trustees</u>',
to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente F. <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>,
Jesus Suarez, Simon de Paula, Fernando J. and Jose Gaston, in their capacity as
'trustees' for appellants-laborers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Three of these five having died, <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span> and
Gaston, with the assistance of legal counsel of Central, filed a petition for
their replacement, with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental (Exhibits JJJJJ-1 thru JJJJJ-3), resulting in the appointment of
three new members:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ysmael</span>

themselves having died, only the three new members could testify during the
hearing of the case in the court below.</blockquote>

first of the team of supervisors, you supervised the actual delivery of the

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, you went to the haciendas and gathered all the laborers and gave
the corresponding amount to the laborers; is that correct?</blockquote>

sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
before that distribution, your supervisor inquired if all those payrolls are
prepared by the respective planters concerned; is it not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
your obligation is to check the payrolls regarding the names of the laborers
and the amount indicated in the payrolls; is that correct?</blockquote>

necessarily check the individual names appearing on the payrolls but also
verify whether the amount released to be distributed tally with the amount
appearing on the payrolls.</blockquote>

that, in all those distributions reflected in this Exhibit '23' – <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> Milling Company, Inc. either you or the member of
your team or any representative of the laborer see to it that the money is
delivered to the laborers concerned; is that correct?</blockquote>

sir, that is the duty of the supervisor to see to it that the corresponding
amount is actually received by the laborers.</blockquote>

you keep that record in the course of the distributions; is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
I correctly get, there would be about 20,000 payrolls of the planters in the
haciendas; is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
can say that there are some planters who have 15 to 50 sheets of payrolls of
the haciendas; so you can just imagine the number of payrolls of the
haciendas.' (<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>., pp. 22-­25, June 18, 1970).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since the Court of Appeals relied upon the foregoing Exhibit
'23' in its finding that the sum of P180,679.38 had not been distributed, that
exhibit should not have been segregated in parts with the Court having chosen
that portion which afforded advantage to the laborers and disregard the other
parts which were to the advantage of the Central and the Planters. (cf. <u>inter

seal of confidentiality as makes for his advantage and insist that it is
privileged as to so much as makes for the advantage of his adversary).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole contents of Exhibit '23' should

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- D -</p>

<p class="BODY">True it is, as already stated earlier, that in petitions for
review of decisions of the Court of Appeals, well and long settled it is that
We are as a rule bound by its findings or conclusions of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant cases, however, after
carefully considering its ratiocination and bases in finding that the share of
the laborers in the proceeds of the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years, and after
mature study of and searching deliberation on the arguments and authorities
very comprehensively advanced and cited in the briefs of the PLANTERS and
VICTORIAS in the portions thereof extensively quoted above, We find Ourselves
sufficiently convinced that the clear and unequivo­cal admission of such
payment in the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span> original and amended
petitions in the trial court, if it cannot be deemed strictly binding upon it,
is a significant persuasive factor We have to count with in deciding the
particular issue of fact now under discussion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Our opinion, there is hardly anything in the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span>
main and reply briefs cogent enough to convince Us contrariwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">We wish to make it clear that in connection with said issue, We
have not overlooked the laudable principles and guidelines that inform both
Republic Act 1257, the charter of the agrarian courts, and Presidential Decree
946, both of which prod the courts to be as liberal as possible in disposing of
labor cases and to be ever mindful of the constitutional precept on the
promotion of social justice, (Sec. 6, Art. II, Philippine Constitution of 1973)
and of the rather emphatic injunction in the constitution that "the State
shall afford protection to labor."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
But We are of the considered opinion that the secondary force to which the ordinary
rules of procedure and evidence have been relegated by the aforementioned
agrarian court laws do not oblige Us to be unjust and unfair to employers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, in the eyes of all fair-minded
men, injustice to the more affluent and fortunate sectors of society cannot be
less condemnable and reprehensible, and should be avoided as much as injustice
to labor and the poor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is divinely
compassionate no doubt to afford more in law to those who have less in life,
but clear injustice to anyone amounts definitely to injustice to everyone, and
all hopes for judicial redress for wrongdoings would vanish, if the even hand
of law, justice and equity were to be made to favor anyone or any group or
level of society, whoever they may be.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is verily not an exagge­ration to assert that in a sense, courts that
uphold and afford real justice can hold back and even repel the forces of
malcontent and subversion more effectively and without loss of lives and blood
and without destruction or devastation than the best equipped regiments of
soldiers of the army.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice, in its
real and deepest essence, more than statute law must always prevail, and the
courts are inexorably expected to do justice to every men at all times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Supreme Court yields to no one in that
respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is its sacred duty and its
sworn pledge that will remain unbroken <span class="SpellE"><u>ruat</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">caelum</span></u>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- E -</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while We are in agreement with the Court of Appeals in its
construction and application of Sections 1 and 9 of Republic Act 809 as
discussed above, We cannot agree with its conclusions regarding the pretended
liability of the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS for the amount that the FEDERATION
claims the laborers of the PLANTERS have not been paid as their share of the
proceeds of the crop years 1952-53 to 1954-55.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In resolving in the manner We have quoted, the second issue formulated
by it relative to the appeal to it of the FEDERATION, it holds the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, the PLANTERS, including petitioners herein Primo
Santos and Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>, and VICTORIAS
"jointly and severally liable for tort in disposing, upon their own
accord, and without any authority of the plantation laborers, of the money of
the said laborers in the total amount of P5,186,083.34 and thus causing the
loss of shares of stock and their earnings purchased out of P4,000,000.00 of
such amount." Indeed, in the course of resolving the second issue and in
disposing of the third issue, the Appellate Court found the PLANTERS and
VICTORIAS guilty of misappropriation and conversion of the P5,186,083.34 plus
the accrual thereof, corresponding to P4M worth of VICTORIAS shares of stock
which under the ASCA was stipulated to be received by the PLANTERS in trust for
the laborers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, this aspect of these instant cases before Us involve
questions both of fact and of law.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- F -</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, and referring first to the issues of fact, let
it be clear that We find from the record and as found by the Court of Appeals,
of the cash portion of P5,185,083.34 corresponding to the laborers pursuant to
the ASCA, namely, P1,185,083.34, what actually the laborers received under the
supervision of the representative of the Secretary (now Ministry) of Labor, was
short only by P180,679.38 per the testimony of Mr. Felipe de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>, the representative of the Department of Labor:</p>

<blockquote>"The evidence shows that, except for a small part
(P180,679.38) of the sum of P5,185,083.34, the entire P1,186,083.34 was
actually paid to the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
testified witness Felipe de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>, representative of
the Department of Labor in charge of the distribution:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>, you said that there were some amounts that
were not distributed because some laborers cannot be located; is this the
amount mentioned in this <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '23', under the words
'amount of undistributed or windfall'?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

<blockquote>"Appellants themselves, in their
brief, have made the following observations:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'So, it can be assumed without fear of contradiction that the last
portion of the said amount of P1<span class="GramE">,186,083.34</span> was
delivered, if ever, to PLANTERS-APPELLANTS­-LABORERS after <st1:date year="1957" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1957</st1:date>.' <span class="GramE">(Appellants'
Brief, p. 326)" (</span><st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">VICTORIAS</span></st1:place></st1:state><span class="GramE">' Brief, pp. 65-66, Appendix 'A', G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-41222.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There is no explanation anywhere in the
records as to what happened subsequently to the shortage of P180<span class="GramE">,679.38</span>, and We, therefore, agree with the Court of Appeals
that judgment should be rendered for the payment thereof, there being no
dispute that the said amount has not been received by the laborers.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- G -</p>

<p class="BODY">We find it difficult, however, to subscribe to the finding of the
Court of Appeals that the greater portion of the P5,185,083.34 in cash and in
shares of stock of VICTORIAS was not received by the laborers and was instead <span class="SpellE">malversed</span> and misappropriated by the PLANTERS and
VICTORIAS.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, We have to state again that the petition that
initiated the instant cases before Us was filed only under date of November 9,
1962 with the Court of Agrarian Relations in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City, that is to say, more than six years after the execution of the ASCA on
March 5, 1956 and the subsequent payment and transfer of shares pursuant
thereto had been factually accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The inaction of the laborers for such a long space of time cannot but
cast shadows of doubt as to the truthfulness of their claim, considering
particularly the hugeness of the amount involved, which anyone aggrieved would
lose no time to move to recover, specially if one takes into account the value
of the Philippine peso during said period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, and indeed rather importantly, the said initial petition
made no reference whatsoever to the now pretended non-­payment, but, on the
contrary, as well shown and argued by the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS in the
portions of their respective briefs We have quoted above, such payment was not
only admitted in said petition as well as in the amended one filed in March,
1964, both of which referred exclusively to the laborers' share in the 1955-56
to 1973-74 crop years but even in the prayer portions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, as will be presently discussed,
the payment in question appears proven by the evidence both oral and
documentary submitted to the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, We must say again, as a general rule, in petitions for
review of decisions of the Court of Appeals, this Supreme Court is bound by the
findings of fact of that Court and that We are limited only to an inquiry as to
whether or not its decision predica­ted on its factual conclusions is in
accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these cases at
bar, however, the factual matter of whether or not the laborers had already
been paid their share corresponding to the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years is
being laid before Us inextricably intertwined with a question of law arising
from the indisputable fact that in the initial pleadings below what is manifest
is not only that there is an express admission in paragraph 10 of the petition
of the laborers "that pursuant to Section 9 of said Act (R.A. 809),
respondent planters gave petitioners-laborers the latter's lawful participation
in the sugar production as well as in the by-products and derivatives thereof
and continued to give the same until November 1, 1955 when they ceased to do so
until the present" but even in the prayer thereof, the FEDERATION confined
the remedy it asked for to the payment of the laborers' share in the proceeds of
the crop years after 1954-55 and up to 1973-74.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot conceive of a more emphatic and unequivocal words to convey
the admission of the payment here in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are now asked to rule on the legal effect of such admis­sion
in the light of the other circumstances extant in the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that connection, there appears no alternative for Us than to
rule that as contended by the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS, under the law, even if
liberally applied, such admission should be considered as having some persuasive
force, unless it was made through palpable mistake or misapprehension of the
relevant circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And what makes
such admission more credible is the fact that not one single laborer was
presented at the trial to deny that he had received his due share.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals has attempted to extricate the laborers from
their lamentable predicament by accepting the explanation of counsel for the
FEDERATION that what the above?quoted paragraph actually was intended to mean
was that VICTORIAS had only reserved the corresponding amount in the
liquidation of the share of the planters in the proceeds during that
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quite misleadingly, to be sure,
the FEDERATION argues in its brief that they could not have made such a factual
admission since at the time their petition was prepared and filed, the money
was still with the central.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How false
such a pretension is can be readily perceived by merely recalling that the
FEDERATION filed its initial petition below in November of 1962, whereas the
record shows indisputably that the payments and transfer of shares had already
been made more than five years before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And as regards the rather naive acceptance by the Court of Appeals of
the explana­tion of the FEDERATION, We hold that it was legally improper to do
so, it appearing that such explanation was made, according to the brief of the
PLANTERS, very much belatedly, only in the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span>
reply brief in that court at page 1446 thereof, without any hint as to why it
was not made earlier in the trial court, where it appears the FEDERATION had
even filed an amended petition in 1964.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, there was no allegation of mistake; all that was done was to
unconvincingly attribute a different subjective meaning to a word that is clear
and unmistakable in itself, by explaining that what the pleader wished to
convey by the word given was that the corresponding amount due the laborers had
already been placed in reserve by the central.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals further tried to sustain the Federation by
citing Section 5 of Rule 10 of the Rules of Court authorizing the courts to
decide cases on the basis of evidence on matters not alleged in the
pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the cited
rule applies only when the evidence on which the court would rely is presented
without objection of the adverse party, since they would then correspond to
issues "tried by express and implied consent of the parties." Here,
however, the record shows that the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS vehemently objected
to any evidence touching on the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years, precisely
because of the explicit admissions contained in the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span> petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not, however, to ignore that nevertheless, the record shows that
somehow both parties did present evidence touching on such payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But judging from what such evidence consisted
of, as reproduced in all the briefs before Us, We are fully satisfied that the
findings and conclusions of fact of the Court of Appeals on the point at issue
do not square with such evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
cite just one example, the tes­timony of the principal witness of the
Federation, Atty. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> is more indicative of the
complete and full payment in question than otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another instance, the ruling of the Court
of Appeals that Exhibit 23-VICMICO is inadmissible because it is merely
secondary evidence is, in Our view, erroneous, considering not only that the
trial court was informed by Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> himself that
the original documents are so voluminous as to make it imprac­ticable to take
them to the court, but also that it was precisely on the basis of said exhibit
that that court made the finding of a shortage of P180,679.38 in the cash
payment, not to mention the obvious fact that the same witness actually made
continuous reference to said exhibit while he was explaining the distribution
of the full amount due the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention of the Federation that said exhibit is a worthless piece of paper is
an exaggeration that cannot hold water.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, no one pretends it is a mere fabrication, being part of the
records of the Department of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, it is possible, as Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> claimed, that
he did not know of the actual issuance, sale and proceeds of sale of the 40,000
shares of stock, but the fact remains that it was he himself who referred to
said documents with notable degree of certainty, at the start, and it was only
later in his testimony that he disclaimed personal knowledge of the truth of
its contents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, insofar as the joining of issues in regard to the point
under discussion, by the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS, on the one hand, with the
FEDERATION, on the other, in their briefs filed with the Court of Appeals, it
is understandable that the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS had no alternative than to do
so as a matter of defense, even as they maintained all the time it was not a
proper issue and was beyond the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to
consider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is quite obvious
that the cited provision is by its very nature and context applicable only in
trial courts and not in the Appellate Courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
What is more, it bears repeating, there was actually no allegation of mistake
here; all that was done by the FEDERATION was to unconvincingly attribute to
the word "give" another meaning convenient and suitable to its
purposes, casting aside the obvious fact that said word is clear and
unmistakable in itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it
appears that said purported explanation was made only in its reply brief, by
way of argument unsupported by any scintilla of relevant evidence presented in
the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Perhaps, We may emphasize again that We are not unaware that We
are dealing with a review of a decision of the Court of Appeals in an appeal
from a case which originated in the Court of Agrarian Relations in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City and that, there­fore, We are not supposed to
adhere strictly to the tenets regard­ing evidence of the Rules of Court, but
must be guided as liberally as possible in favor of the laborers in searching
for the true facts upon which their claim is based, having in view Republic Act
1257 and Presidential Decree 946 and more imperatively, the constitutional
provisions on social justice and protection to labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as can be seen, it is indeed in the
light of these principles that We have scrutinized the reasoning and
argumentation of the Appellate Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
reiterate, at this point, that observing the Rules of Court only secondarily
per mandate of Republic Act 1267 and Presidential Decree No. 946 does not, in
Our considered opinion, preclude the Courts of Agrarian Relations and the
Appellate Courts, from applying long established principles in judicial fact
finding that are founded on reason and the common sense and experience of
mankind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admissions, specially if
express, have always been universally considered by all authorized <span class="SpellE">triers</span> of facts as evidence of the highest order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To obviate their effect as such, there must
be potent and cogent considerations that are as equally convincing to the mind
as the compulsive persuasiveness of a man's statement or declaration against
his own interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the cases at bar,
We are satisfied, We regret to say, that the FEDERATION has failed to provide
Us with any­thing but pleas for emotional sympathy to enable this Court to pay
little heed to or much less ignore the persuasive force of its written formal
admission that their members <u>have already been given and "continue to
be given" their due legal share of the proceeds of 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop
years in question</u>, except for the amount of P180,679.38.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is Our conclusion from such admission and
the evidence supporting the same, and more particularly from the absence of
contrary evidence duly presented by the FEDERATION at the trial, that the truth
is what said admission expressly declares.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- H -</p>

<p class="BODY">With the matter of the cash payment thus resolved, <span class="GramE">We</span> may now turn Our eyes to the Four Million (P4M) Pesos
worth of shares of stock of <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
which, under the terms of the ASCA, were stipulated to be issued to the
PLANTERS or their authorized Special Committee or Board of Trustees in trust
for the benefit of the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
regard to this matter, there are, as We view the situation, two controversial
issues to be settled, namely, first, whether or not, it was proper for the
PLANTERS and VICTORIAS to provide for such manner of payment to the laborers
instead of in cash, and, second, disregarding the matter of such alleged
impropriety, whether or not said shares or the proceeds thereof were received
by the laborers.</p>

<p class="BODY">For obvious reasons, <span class="GramE">We</span> have to deal
with the second issue ahead of the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in this respect, suffice it to say that the question of whether or
not the proceeds of the VICTORIAS shares of stock corresponding to them under
the ASCA had been actually received by them from their respective planters has
already been resolved by Us above not only as necessarily in­cluded in the
binding force of the admission of the FEDERATION in its original petition and
amended petitions below but as proven by overwhelming evidence overlooked
apparently by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
be clearer, contrary to the finding of the Court of Appeals, We hereby hold
that the proceeds of all the P4M worth of VICTORIAS shares corresponding to the
laborers under the ASCA were not only received in the form of shares by the
PLANTERS from VICTORIAS but that the proceeds of the sale thereof by the Board
of Trustees, together with their accruals, were actually received by the
laborers from their respective planters-employers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reiterate that not a single laborer had
testified to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
Chairman Newton <span class="SpellE">Jison</span> testified positively to such
effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing conclusion, it is hardly of any consequence
for Us to discuss what the Court of Appeals, breathing, as it were, with
evident indignation and a stirring sense of reprobation, condemned to be an
unauthorized and improper act of the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS of planning, so to
speak, and agreeing just between the two of them how the share of the laborers
of 6% of the proceeds from 1952 to 1955 should be paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inferentially, if not directly, the Appellate
Court found that the payment partly in cash and partly in shares of stock could
have been done and should have been done only upon consultation with and with
the consent or assent of the laborers either thru the FEDERATION or any of
their authorized representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can
admit that indeed that would have been most ideal to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, however, what happened was not
exactly that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just the same, We
shall proceed to show that the laborers were never at the short end of the bargain.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portions of the ASCA read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"'(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Party of the
Second Part shall set aside Sixty Per Cent (60%) of the said sum of
P8,643,472.24 as received by them to be held in trust for the benefit of their
laborers that may be entitled thereto because some of them have already died

<p class="BODY">Thus, it is unmistakably clear that as far as <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
was concerned, it agreed to give to the PLANTERS the 10% it had precisely
reserved for that purpose in order to comply with the mandate of the law in the
event its challenge against its constitutionality should fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as it happened, it opted soon enough not
to continue pressing that challenge by extra judicially entering into a
settlement with the PLANTERS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as
regards the actual implementation of the portion of the agreement regarding the
share of the laborers, apart from the admission of the FEDERATION, oft repeated
earlier; relative to the actual receipt by its members of their legal share of
1952 to 1955 crop years, We might relevantly point out that Chairman <span class="SpellE">Jison</span> testified without contradiction thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">These, in addition to the testimony to
the same effect of Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> of the Department (now
Ministry) of Labor lengthily quoted above as parts of the portions of the
briefs of the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
say, to the same effect, because it is Our definite impression that read as a
whole, and evaluated together with Exhibit 23-VICMICO, that testimony, albeit
rather vague, confusing and at some places evasive, proved sufficiently that
what were due the laborers in cash and in shares of stock (or the proceeds of
the sale thereof) had been fully settled under the supervision of Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> and his men not later than 1956 or 1957 in five phases
of distribution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that Exhibit
23-VICMICO was declared inadmissible as secondary evidence by the Court of
Appeals, but what is even more legally accurate is that such ruling is
erroneous, if only because said exhibit was precisely used by Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> as basis for his testimony, and he explained that the
pertinent records supporting the same were so voluminous that it would be
impractical to take them to the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, We are persuaded it cannot be said that the
FEDERATION or the laborers did not agree to the modality of payment provided
for in the ASCA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all they muttered
against it, it was only belatedly during the trial, that is, after they had
already received the cash portion therein provided.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, We cannot share the view implicit in the decision of the
Court of Appeals that the principal witness regarding the same, Mr. Felipe de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>, the representative of the Secretary of Labor, under
whose supervision, Section 9 of the Act requires the payments to the laborers
to be made, was not duly aware of the medium provided in said ASCA that P4M of
the share due the laborers would not be paid in cash but would be invested in
the form of 40,000 shares of VICTORIAS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As may be noted from the Appellate Court's decision, the transcript of
the stenographic notes of Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia's</span> testimony
evidences that he had in his possession the record of the distribution of the
P4M, although the said court held such assertion not to be the best
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether such ruling is correct
or not, it refers only to the actual distribution of the cash and the shares of
stock or the proceeds of the sale thereof, but the fact that P4M were to be
paid in shares appears indubitably proven.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are thus of the considered opinion that the findings of fact of the
Court of Appeals inconsistent with Our observations herein do not accord with
conventional knowledge of men and the general experience of the business world,
hence Our authority to modify the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to Us but natural to assume that said witness, Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>,
knew or ought to have known of such medium of settling the laborers' claim
because it is to be presumed that in the regularity of the performances of his
duties to supervise the payment to the laborers, on behalf of the Secretary of
Labor, he had read and did know the pertinent contents of the ASCA before
supervising any payment at all to the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted that of P1,186,083.34 due in cash to the laborers, the
latter were actually paid under his supervision, the said amount minus
P180,679.38.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot suppose that he
undertook that task without inquiring into the whys and wherefores thereof,
that is to say, the reasons and details related to the amount being then
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could it have been possible
for him to have supervised the payment of any amount to the laborers without
determining first whether such payment was in full or not or in faithful
compliance with Section 9 of the Republic Act 809?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no doubt he must have been told about
or even shown the ASCA, which was the basis for the payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were otherwise, it was his inescapable
duty to inquire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We presume, by mandate
of the law, that he had complied with that duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More, it is highly improbable that the
FEDERATION did not know that what was due its members was P5,186,083.34.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In truth, there is nothing before Us showing
that the FEDERATION objected at all to the manner of payment provided in the
ASCA when the time for implementation came.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As far as the records before Us indicate, the laborers received under
Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia's</span> supervision P1,186,083.34 (minus
P180,679.38) without a word of complaint from anyone, either the FEDERATION or
the SECRETARY.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are, therefore, not
disposed to find that the mode of payment agreed upon in the ASCA was without
the conformity or consent, even if subsequent to its execution, of the laborers
and the Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that
there was such consent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it should be recalled that after Civil Case
No. 16815 of the Court of First Instance of Manila, wherein it was held that
all the contracts being insisted upon by VICTORIAS as still existent had
already expired on June 22, 1952, which decision was affirmed by this Supreme
Court in G.R. No. L-6648 on July 25, 1955, in another suit, Civil Case No.
22577, also in the Court of First Instance of Manila, wherein the
constitutionality of Republic Act 809 was impugned by VICTORIAS, the validity
of ASCA itself was put to question when VICTORIAS and the PLANTERS submitted to
the court their manifestation on April 23, 1956 that they had come to an
extrajudicial settlement effective upon the signing of the General Collective
Sugar Contract (Exhibits YYY and YYY-7), which was ultimately signed by
majority of the PLANTERS on or before May 31, 1956.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The challenge was made not only by some
individual planters, like the <span class="SpellE">Coruñas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, Chapa, Valencia, et al., but more importantly also
by the Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
intervention of these challengers was not allowed by the court, and on <st1:date year="1956" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1956</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">We</span>
issued a resolution in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-11218 dismissing a petition
against such denial.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">So, while it is true that the ASCA was questioned as being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 1 of the Sugar Act of 1952, the
challenge was in relation <u>alone</u> to the contention of the FEDERATION, the
SECRETARY OF LABOR and some planters that the ratio of sharing provided for in
Section 1 of the Act is unalterable by contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the manner in which the payment of
what is due to the laborers was concerned, that is, that stipulated in the
ASCA, We are impressed convincingly that the same must have appeared
satisfactory to all the parties concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, if the FEDERATION had felt that the mode or medium of payment
stipulated in the ASCA was prejudicial or in any way inimical to the interests
of its members, why was the cash payment of P1.8 M plus accepted without, as
far as We can see from the records, any qualification or reservation on its
part or on that of the Secretary of Labor?<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On the contrary, what We note is that the transfer to the PLANTERS of 40,000
shares of VICTORIAS in trust for the laborers could have been viewed by the
laborers with alacrity, not only because of the attractively high increment it
was supposed to earn for them, but, what is more, the laborers would become
thereby co-owners of the mill.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to Us of little, nay insignificant, moment who conceived or
"engineered" the plan, whether VICTORIAS or any other party and what
motivated the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What cannot be
denied is that under normal standards, no one can perceive therein any
prejudice or risk to the pecuniary interests of the laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To speak of it, therefore, as approximating something
immoral or improper, even illegal, for VICTORIAS to agree to it, as the
Appellate Court did, is to miscomprehend entirely its concept, which under the
circumstances then prevailing appeared to be the most practical and feasible
way of meeting the situation for the convenience and benefit of the laborers
themselves, the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- I -</p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the conclusion that of the cash portion
stipulated in the ASCA plus the proceeds of the sale of the 40,000 shares of
VICTORIAS stock had already been "given" to use the word of the
FEDERATION itself in its pleadings below, long before the case in the trial
court was initiated, only P180,679.38 of the claim of the laborers pertaining
to the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years remain unpaid, We shall now dwell on the
curious and strange holding of the Court of Appeals that VICMICO and the
PLANTERS are jointly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable to the
laborers for the payment of their claims, but only insofar as said P180,679.38
are concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Referring to the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span> position
in this respect, that is, the joint and <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
liability of the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the
1952 to 1955 phase of these cases, We must say that the same looks more like a
dragnet intended to catch both the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS one way or
another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After having admitted in its
initial pleadings with an express assertion that the laborers concerned had
already been "given" what is due them for the period in question, at
the trial, its claim bulged to over P7 M for the 1952-1955 period, albeit it
came out from the evidence that of such claim only P180,679.38 had not been
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(According to Mr. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>, the corresponding laborers could not be located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law, however, in such an instance
the money due the lost laborers goes to a designated government fund for the
general amelioration of labor and labor conditions in the whole country.)
Actually, We might reiterate, said initial pleadings of the Federation made no
reference at all to the crop years 1952-53 to 1954-55, but was confined itself
to the claim that from 1955-56 crop year to 1973-74, the laborers were not
being paid what is due them under the law, which they insisted then was 6% of
the 10% increase due the PLANTERS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the FEDERATION based its original claim on the theory of
obligation created by law, but, of course, in reference only to the 1956 to
1974 crop years – nothing of 1952-53 to 1954-55.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, as may be gleaned from the decision of the Court of
Appeals, in that Court, the FEDERATION shifted to another pose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It claimed, contrary to its admission in its
original and amended petition in the trial court, that the laborers had not
been actually fully paid what is due them for 1952 to 1955, and notwith­standing
their receipt or acceptance, without any protest or qualification of the cash
portion (which turned out to be short by P180,679.38) provided in the ASCA, it
assailed, rather belatedly, the legality and propriety of that agreement's
provision to the effect that P4 M due them would be paid in 40,000 shares of
stock to be entrusted to a Special Committee or Board of Trustees composed of
five planters, and what is more, it contended vehemently that the laborers had
not received any of said shares or any portion of the proceeds of the sale
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the legal aspect of such
belated claim, its basis became no longer an obligation created by law but a
liability imposed according to it by Articles 20 and 21 of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it must have also relied on torts, for in
its decision, the Court of Appeals found "the Central (VICTORIAS and
PLANTERS jointly and severally liable for tort" while citing in another
portion of its decision also Articles 20 and 21 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must confess We are perplexed by such evident confusion of the
pertinent juridical concepts in civil law in such postures of the Court of
Appeals and the FEDERATION.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
legal provision that could impute joint and several or solidarity to the
PLANTERS and VICTORIAS is Article 2194 of the Civil Code which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 2194.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
responsibility of two or more persons who are liable for a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> is <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since in this jurisdiction torts is generally equated with the <u>quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span></u> or <u>culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span></u>
or <u>extra-contractual</u> defined and elucidated in Chapter 2, Title XVII,
comprising of Articles 2176 to 2194 of the Civil Code, it must have been for
this reason, that without mentioning the <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
provisions just referred to, and trying to play safe, as it were, with its
reference to torts in general, the Court of Appeals made its holding under
discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surprisingly, however, it
later on cited Articles 20 and 21 of the Civil Code, thereby implying that its
reference to torts might be in relation to these two later articles under
Chapter 2 on Human Relations of Chapter I of the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not hesitate to hold as We hereby hold that such a
confusion of simple and well-known civil law concepts is unfortunate, to say
the least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is an obvious mix-up of
the several sources of obligation under existing laws, and one is left
uncertain whether what is being relied on is only one of them or a combination
of them or all of them together, which would naturally be a veritable juridical
and legal abnormality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the benefit
of everyone concerned, We shall make a brief analysis of each of them that have
been directly or indirectly referred to by the Court of Appeals or the
FEDERATION.</p>

<p class="BODY">In regard to the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span> initial
contention about obligation created by law, undoubtedly, it had in mind
Sections 1 and 9 of Republic Act 809.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But since in such initial pleading, the subject matter and cause of
action referred to crop years 1955-56 to 1973-74, the FEDERATION is correct in
sustaining that the laborers are entitled to a 60% share in the increase given
to the PLANTERS by the CENTRAL. Its only misconception in such posture is that
it assumed that the ratios in Section 1 of the Act have to be followed even if
there were a majority of planters with written contracts with <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
and the decision of the Court of Appeals, that position is untenable. However,
the laborers are nevertheless entitled to 2.4% out of the 4% increase that
pertained to the PLANTERS under the ASCA. Accordingly, the PLANTERS are liable
to their respective laborers for the 2.4% that indisputably they have not paid
since 1955 to 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, that is
an obligation created by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">But arising as it does from Republic Act 809, the relevant
question that arises is whether such liability of the PLANTERS is joint and
several or <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After mature deliberation, considering the peculiar facts of these cases
wherein it appears that the PLANTERS always acted in concert with one another
or as a single unit, We hold that the PLANTERS as an association, if it is, or
all the planters in the <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span> sugar milling
district, whether members or not of such possible association, and this
includes petitioners Santos, as a lessee planter, and <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>,
are jointly and severally liable for the whole amount due all the laborers
involved in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the
pretended liability of <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
in this respect, <span class="GramE">We</span> have already disposed of that
matter earlier above.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the matter of torts, the FEDERATION cites from
Judge C. P. <span class="SpellE">Caguioa's</span> Comments and Cases on Civil
Law, Vol. I, 1967 ed. to evidently give the impression that Article 20 of the
Civil Code has adopted or imported into Our jurisdiction the so-called
Anglo-American concept of torts which adds malice to the fault or negligence
contemplated in the <u>quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span></u> or <u>culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span></u> or <u>extra-contractual</u> of our Civil
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such citation, We regret to say,
does not <span class="SpellE">reenforce</span> at all the stand of the
laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truth to tell, with all due
respect to the opinion of Judge <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>, a known
civilian, Article 20 does not contem­plate malice <u>per se</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The article reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every person
who, contrary to law, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> or negligently causes
damage to another, shall indemnify the latter for the same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This article creates a new source of obligation in addition to <u>culpa
<span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While Article 2176 mentions only fault or negligence, as can be seen,
the above-quoted article requires that the person to be held liable must have
acted "contrary to law" in "<span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>
or negligently <span class="SpellE">caus</span>(<span class="SpellE">ing</span>)
damage to another." If <span class="GramE">We</span> are to believe the
following citation in <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
brief:</p>

<blockquote>"In order that liability under Article 2176 of the Civil Code
will arise the following requisites must exist:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) There must be damage or prejudice which must be proven by the party
claiming it; (b) There must be an unlawful act or omission amounting to fault

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear from the foregoing brief discussion of the
juridical concepts of torts, <u>culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span></u>
and Article 20 of the Civil Code that neither the PLANTERS, and much less
VICTORIAS, appears to be guilty of tort in any sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the holding of the Court of
Appeals that "the Central and PLANTERS are liable in tort" to the
laborers of the former has no factual nor legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consequence, it necessarily follows that
the joint and several liability imposed by the Court of Appeals upon VICTORIAS
must be, as it is hereby, held to be erroneous and uncalled for, factually, as
shown earlier in Our discussion of the relationship between the laborers of the
PLANTERS and VICTORIAS, and legally, in the light of what We have just
explained is the only correct legal basis of the laborers' claim, namely, an
obligation arising from law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
reiterate, the law, that is, Republic Act 809, does not impose upon the
centrals, whether expressly or impliedly, any joint and several liability with
the planters for the share which the Act apportions for the laborers of the
planters, since it is the responsibility exclusively of the planters to pay
their laborers after they have been given by the central what is due them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the inherent nature of the
obligation of the planters, that of paying their own laborers, has never been
from the inception of the sugar industry up to the present, <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
with the Centrals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1207 of the
Civil Code provides in this respect thus:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1207.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
concurrence of two or more creditors or two or more debtors in one and the same
obligation does not imply that each one of the former has a right to demand, or
that each one of the latter is bound to render, entire compliance with the <span class="SpellE">prestation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
a <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability only when the obligation
expressly so states, or when the law or the nature of the obligation requires
solidarity."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In these premises, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot see how <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state> may be
held jointly and severally liable with the PLANTERS, contrary to what has been
held by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">XIII</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing sufficiently resolve, the first eight (I to VIII)
of the ten (10) assignment of errors of the FEDERATION.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall now tackle the remaining two of
them.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- A -</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Assignment of Error IX, the FEDERATION ascribes to the
Court of Appeals the alleged error of not holding VICTORIAS and the PLANTERS
jointly and severally liable for exemplary damages for the losses that the
laborers have suffered because they were not paid their share of the 1952-53 to
1954-55 crop years production.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless
to say, as a consequence of Our holding that by their own admission and the
evidence misapprehended, in Our view, by the Court of Appeals, all the amounts
due them for said period have already been paid, except P180,679.38, We can per­ceive
no legal reason why such claim for exemplary damages should be awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With particular reference to the P180,679.38
left unpaid in 1955, <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span> own witness de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> explained that the laborers to which the same
correspond could not be located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
light of such explanation, it would be unfair to even think of exemplary
damages for the non-payment thereof.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- B -</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the matter of the non-payment by the PLANTERS of the 2.4%
due their laborers, a little clarification may be called for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We feel that the legal provision mandating
such payment may indeed not be readily understood by or comprehensible to
everyone in the same sense it was construed by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> and by the Court of Appeals in its subject
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, it is undeniable that
Section 9 of Republic Act 809 uses the words "any increase in
participation granted the planters <u>under this Act</u>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underlining Ours) Read literally, there
could be a little shade of plausibility in the posture of VICTORIAS and
PLANTERS that only any increase as a result of the application of Section 1 of
the Act is contemplated in its Section 9, and not an increase by virtue of a
written milling contract executed after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the Act, even if those who do so might constitute the majority of the
planters in the district.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as We
postulated in <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>, any increase given to
the planters by any central after the passage of the Act cannot be viewed in
any way than that which has been induced or forced to be done on account of the
compulsive effect of the various related provisions of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Virtually, therefore, any such increase
should be deemed as an "increase - - - under this Act", since it is a
result of its operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Understandably,
since it is only because of this Court's construction of the Act rather liberally,
to be sure, in favor of labor, We cannot say that, in the words of Article 2233
of the Civil Code, the laborers here are entitled to recover exemplary damages
"as a matter of right." We must consider that per Article 2234,
"the plaintiff must show that he is entitled to moral, temperate or
compensatory damages before the court may consider the question of whether or
not exemplary damages should be awarded." In the instant cases, all
relevant circumstances considered, We fail to see Our way clear to granting any
kind of moral, temperate or compensatory damages to the laborers, and We are
not doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact and in law, We
have no basis to go that far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it
is pointless to speak of exemplary damages here.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- C -</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the FEDERATION complains that the Court of Appeals erred
in reducing to 10% the 20% attorney's contingent fees stipulated in the
laborers' contract with their counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Page 307, Laborers' Brief) Every material point discussed in the brief
taken into account, We share the conclusion of the Appellate Court that the
said ten (10%) per centum award of attorney's fees is just and adequate.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">XIV</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>'
petition is concerned, there are only three assignments of error (VII, VIII and
XII) that may not be said to be squarely resolved in the above opinion.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- A -</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state> vehemently
maintains in its Assignment of Errors No. VII that nowhere in the course of the
proceedings below, starting from the allegations of both the original and
amended petition of the FEDERATION through the evidence it presented without
opportune and appropriate objection, may there be traced any theory having the
semblance of reliance on the law on torts, whether in the concept of <u>culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span></u> or under Articles 20 and 21 of the Civil
Code, the alleged Anglo-Saxon version, per Judge <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>,
<u>supra</u>, or, any other variant thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>,
the alternative bases percept­ible in the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span>
petitions which ultimately led to the instant cases before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
now were either an obligation arising from law (Republic Act 809) or one that
is contractual, the latter being somewhat vague to Us, since it is in fact
premised on the alleged invalidity of the provisions of the ASCA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And here, it is the position of VICTORIAS
that assuming the cause of action of the FEDERATION could still be legally convertible
in the appellate stage of the proceedings, either in the Court of Appeals or
here, to one of "torts", We should dismiss the <span class="SpellE">FEDERATION's</span>
petition, the same having been filed in November 1962 or more than four (4)
years after the alleged cause of action arose in 1955 or 1956, citing Article
1146 (2) of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the view We have taken of the whole controversy as discussed
in the above opinion, We deem it unnecessary to pass on such seventh assignment
of error of VICTORIAS regarding prescription of an action on torts, whether We
look at it in relation to the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years controversy or in
connection with the 2.4% claim of the laborers for crop years 1956 to 1974.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- B -</p>

<p class="BODY">It is <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>'
posture in its assignment of error <span class="GramE">No</span>. XII that the
real nature of the action of the laborers in these cases is one for accounting,
hence, as a preliminary matter, <span class="GramE">We</span> should first
determine whether or not they are entitled to such accounting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, it looks to <span class="GramE">Us</span> that <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>'
claim is that it is premature yet at this stage of the controversy to deal with
any sums of money or amounts due the laborers, there being no showing extant in
the record that such entitlement exists.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold We do not have to spend more ink
and paper to deal with such contention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Either it is quite clear that the FEDERATION has sufficiently
established the predicate for accounting insofar as the PLANTERS are concerned
or <span class="GramE">We</span> consider it superfluous to make any ruling as to
the point in question for the purposes of these cases, since the ultimate
result of Our above opinion would virtually not be different anyway.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- C -</p>

<p class="BODY">There is one point raised by <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
which although generally covered somehow in the above opinion, deserves special
mention and discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The central
maintains that in the interrelation among the planters, the plantation laborers
and the miller, it has always been the practice and actually a legal axiom that
the central, on the one hand, and the planter, on the other, whether the latter
be a landowner or lessee or one who just factually plants and delivers his
harvest for milling to the central of the corresponding district under any
other arrangement with the landowner concerned, are the only ones who enter
into contractual relations with each other, and in all the contracts between
them, since the sugar industry began, nothing whatsoever has been provided with
respect to the laborers, either of the miller or the planters, except, in any
event, precisely to make it clear that neither of them would have anything to
do with the terms and conditions of each other's workers or laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have stated earlier and <span class="GramE">We</span>
reiterate Our view that there is nothing in Republic Act No. 809 that alters
such a long standing factual and juridical situation.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, it cannot be denied that under Republic Act 809, for the
first time, outside of enacting the Minimum Wage, Law and expressly extending
fringe benefits, like cost-of-living allowances, bonuses, etc. to the workers
in the sugar industry not only in the farms but also in the mills, the
government has never fixed the manner in which the planters should share the
proceeds of milled sugarcane with their respective plantation laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And notably, in Section 9 of the Act, the
Congress made it abundantly specific that what the provision contemplates in
the partition between the planters, on the one hand, and their respective
plantation laborers, on the other, is of "any increase in the
participation granted the planters under this Act and above their present
share," which the provision explicitly mandates "shall be divided
between the planter and his laborer in the plantation (and that) (T)he (said)
distribution of the share corresponding to the laborers shall be made under the
supervision of the Department of Labor."</p>

<p class="BODY">Such being the case, VICTORIAS suggests the proposition that,
therefore, if somehow the Act creates any link at all between the plantation
laborers and the central, Section 9 itself makes the planter the agent of his
laborers in such relationship and speaks for them and is responsible to them as
their principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, therefore, the
PLANTERS entered into and <span class="SpellE">signe</span> the ASCA, they did so
not only for themselves but for and on behalf of their principal, the laborers,
in respect to all matters concerning the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>
argues that the plantation laborers are bound by the terms and conditions of
the ASCA as parties thereto, represented by their agent, the PLANTERS.</p>

<p class="BODY">There may be something in such pose, but rather than go into the
intricacies and complications that evidently would need to be elucidated and
resolved in relation thereto, but which anyway would be inconsequential as far
as the basic views of these cases expressed in Our above opinion are concerned,
We prefer to deal with VICTORIAS' argument under discussion on some other
appropriate occasion when its resolution should become indispensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, in the cases at bar, it is already
altogether clear, as We have discussed in Our above opinion, that whatever the
plantation laborers are claiming is due them must be the exclusive
responsibility and liability of the PLANTERS jointly and severally among
themselves, to the complete exclusion of VICTORIAS.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">XV</p>

<p class="BODY">All of the assignments of errors of the PLANTERS (I to VI) in
their brief with Us have been resolved in Our opinion above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, something they mentioned
in their prayer that We might just as well clear up and dispose of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PLANTERS pray that they should not be
made liable to their respective laborers for any of the claims herein involved
because they have not "engineered nor pocketed that which allegedly belong
to the laborers as a result of the ASCA, for they (the PLANTERS) got only what
they are entitled to under Republic Act 809", and elsewhere, they suggest
that should they be found somehow liable, VICTORIAS should be adjudged to
reimburse them <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall not concern Ourselves about the "engineering"
that brought forth the ASCA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
of Appeals discussed that matter in detail in its decision now under review,
and its factual conclusions relative thereto, whether right or wrong, cannot,
to Our mind be of pivotal influence in the ultimate resolution of these
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a sense, what circumstances go
in the process of formulating contracts between the sugar centrals and the
planters are matters of public knowledge among all those duly informed about
and concerned with the sugar industry, and We must assume that whatever comes
out of their bargaining cannot be but their voluntary and mutual agreements,
even if, in this connection, it is but fair to admit that by force of the
inherent nature of the indispensability of the centrals as the last factor of
production of the saleable milled sugar, its superior position is an economic
reality everyone must accept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
of Appeals realisti­cally considered the matter as something that is not
illegal (and not exactly immoral), much less in contravention or circumvention
of the Sugar Act, but dictated by the legitimate exercise of all individuals to
make a profitable bargain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emphatically,
it must be said though, that the PLANTERS were not entirely helpless, for as We
see the scenario that may be flashed out of Republic Act 809, all that the
PLANTERS had to do was to refuse to sign any contract with VICTORIAS, in which
event, the government, thru a receiver, would have run the mill and the
PLANTERS could have gotten the 10% increase provided in Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they signed, as they did, a contract, the
ASCA, providing for a 36-64% partition, We can only deduce ineluctably that
such was a better option for them under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since, everyone is presumed to know the
law, for ignorance thereof "excuses no one from compliance therewith",
and the courts, after all, are not guardians of parties, <span class="SpellE"><u>sui</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">juris</span></u>, who might get the shorter end at
bargaining tables, We have no alternative but to conclude that when they signed
the ASCA, the PLANTERS were well aware that of the 4% increase granted therein
to them, 60% had to be paid by them to their respective laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when they plead that what they got
under the ASCA was only what they are entitled to under the Act, they must not
be understood as referring to the whole 4% but only to 1.6%.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let it be plainly understood, in this connection, that under Our <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> ruling, the laborers are entitled to no more
than 60% of any increase in any increase in participation their respective
planters-employers might be granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Beyond that, whatever goes to the PLANTERS and to <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>,
for that matter, are theirs as a matter of law and right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To speak of "pocketing" by anyone
of somebody else's rightful and lawful share is somehow malicious and entirely
unwarranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the facts extant in the record, and applying the law
thereto, it is the conclusion of this Court that the PLANTERS are inescapably
liable to their respective laborers in the amounts and manner hereinabove set
forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should know better than to
place the blame on anyone else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
respective laborers have been deprived long enough of what is legally and
rightfully theirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unimaginable
how said laborers could have had better lives and living conditions, worthy of
their work, had the PLANTERS been more socially-minded and humanely concerned
about the welfare of those that have made them the "sugar lords"
during better times in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To make things clearer, the claim for
reimbursement by the PLANTERS is hereby overruled.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">XVI</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition of planters Primo Santos and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span> requires no separate discussion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their claims that the trial court had no
jurisdiction over their persons and that they should not be held liable for
obligations under a contract they have not signed deserve scant consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, those points are already properly
dealt with in the above opinion, hence all their assignment of errors are
hereby held to be untenable.</p>

An initial attempt to pass a law referring only to the relationship between the

In respect to the 1952-53 to 1954-55 crop years, the Court of Appeals directly
imputed connivance to the PLANTERS and VICTORIAS seemingly because, in its
opinion, "the payment of P4 M in shares of stock instead of in cash was
prejudicial (or at least resulted in prejudice or loss) to the laborers. But as
regards the 1955-56 to 1973-74 crop years, the ASCA contained no provision
other than what <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span> and the Court of
Appeals held to be legal, namely, for <st1:state><st1:place>VICTORIAS</st1:place></st1:state>

Somewhere in the brief of the laborers, there is an indication that earlier,
the Secretary of Labor voiced his objection to the part payment in shares of
stock, but such objection paled into insignificance when no protest was made by
him, when pursuant to the ASCA, the actual payment of the cash portion and the
issuance of 40,000 shares were actually made. In fact, there is convincing
evidence in the record that the payment was made under the direct supervision

Computed on the basis of the share of the LABORERS' share of 6% in the 1952-53
to 1954-55 crop years, it may be estimated that with the 2.4% corresponding to
them for the crop years 1955-56 to 1973-74, under this judgment, the LABORERS
should receive a total amount in the neighborhood of Thirty Million (P30 M)
Pesos. This estimate is subject to the amount to be determined by the trial
court.</p>
