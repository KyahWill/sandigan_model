<p class="BODY">On December 11, 1970, private respondents Adelina Bagadiong and
Rosario Sto. Tomas, filed an action for damages against petitioner in the Court
of First Instance of Camarines Sur, docketed therein as Civil Case No.
7047.  On May 18, 1972, a similar
action, Civil Case No. 7307, was filed in the same court by the other private
respondent, Ladislao Santos.  On
February 9, 1973, considering that these two cases arose from the same incident
and involved the same defendant and counsel for plaintiffs in both cases, a
joint hearing of these cases was ordered and conducted by the lower court upon
motion of both parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the significant role of evidentially-supported
factual findings of the lower courts in the decisional processes of appellate
courts, we find it necessary to reproduce the same, as reported in these cases
by respondent court, together with the proceedings in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"The amended complaint in Civil Case No. 7047 alleges, <u>inter</u>
<u>alia</u>, that on November 16, 1970, plaintiffs Adelina Bagadiong and
Rosario Sto. Tomas, now appellees, made reservations with, and bought two plane
tickets from, defendant (Naga City branch station), now appellant, a common
carrier engaged in the business of transporting passengers by air for
compensation, for Naga-Manila flight on November 26, 1970; that on November 24,
1970, plaintiffs went back to defendant Naga City branch station and paid the
fare for two round trip tickets; that plaintiffs were not only issued their
round trips tickets, but also their reservation in defendant's 3:40 o'clock
afternoon Naga-Manila flight on November 26, 1970 were expressly confirmed by
the Naga City branch station; that at three o'clock in the afternoon of
November 26, 1970, or forty-five minutes before the scheduled departure time of
the Naga-Manila flight, plaintiffs checked in at the Pili airport counter of
defendant and there the latter's agent or employees got the tickets of the
plaintiffs allegedly for the purpose of issuing to them a boarding pass; that
few minutes before departure time, plaintiffs' luggage was loaded to (sic) the
plane, but plaintiffs were not given back their tickets and were not allowed by
defendant's agent or employees to board the plane; and that after the plane had
taken off from the Pili airport with the luggage of plaintiffs, in spite of
their complaint, all that defendant's agent or employees did at the Naga City
branch station was to refund plaintiffs' fares.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contending that defendant common carrier acted in bad faith
in the breach of its contract with them, plaintiffs claimed for moral damages
'in the amount of no less than P10,000.00 each', exemplary damages and actual
damages.  It is prayed that defendant be
ordered to pay plaintiffs, among others, 'the sum of P20,000.00 for moral
damages' and P6,000.00 by way of expenses of litigation including attorney's
fees'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Civil Case No. 7307, the complaint alleges, among others,
that on November 24, 1970, when plaintiff Ladislao Santos, now appellee, bought
a plane ticket at the branch station of defendant in Naga City for Flight 296
from Naga to Manila scheduled on the afternoon of November 26, 1970, he was
assured by the employees of defendant that his reservation for the flight was
confirmed; that at two o'clock in the afternoon of November 26, 1970, one hour
and forty minutes before the scheduled departure time of Flight 296, plaintiff
checked in at the Pili airport counter and then and there the employees of
defendant asked for his ticket, allegedly for the purpose of issuing to him a
boarding pass; that about three minutes before departure of Flight 296, the
ticket was returned to plaintiff by defendant's employee, informing him that
there was no more seat available and he could not ride on that flight to
Manila; that the employees of the defendant acted rudely and discourteously to
his embarrassment in the presence of so many people who were at the airport at
that time; that it was very important and urgent for plaintiff to be in Manila
on the afternoon of November 26, 1970, because he had an appointment with an
eye specialist for medical treatment of his eye and he and his brother were 'to
close a contract they entered into to supply shrimps to some restaurants and
market vendors in Manila'; and that he and his brother failed to close the
contract to supply shrimps, as it was on December 1, 1970, that he was finally
able to reach Manila by train.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Likewise, claiming that defendant acted in bad faith in the
breach of its contract with him, plaintiff Ladislao Santos has claimed for
moral damages ‘in the amount of no less than P70,000.00’, exemplary damages and
actual damages in 'the sum of P20,000.00 x x x which include(s) attorney's fees
and expenses of litigation'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In its answer to the amended complaint, as well as to the
complaint of other plaintiff-appellee, defendant-appellant common carrier
interposed, among others the following common special and affirmative defenses;
that the aircraft used for Flight 296R/26 November 1970 (Virac-Naga-Manila) is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a 44-seater; that due to the cancellation of
its morning flight from Virac, some of its passengers for said flight took
Flight </span>296R; that on the representations of Governor Alberto of
Catanduanes, one of those manifested in the cancelled morning flight, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">its (defendant's) employees at its Virac </span>station
were constrained 'to allow the Governor to take Flight 296R together with
several companions' with the assurance of the Governor that two (2) of his
companions would deplane in Naga; that on arrival in Naga, the two companions
of the Governor refused to deplane despite repeated pleas and entreaties of its
employees; that unable to persuade the two Virac passengers to deplane in Naga
and 'compelled by a reasonable and well-grounded fear that an untoward incident
may ensue should the two (2) be forced to leave the aircraft', its employees
'had to act in a manner dictated by the circumstances and by reasons of safety
both of the passengers and the aircraft and crew'; that its failure to carry
plaintiffs on board the plane 'was necessitated by reason of safety and/or
compliance with applicable laws, regulations or orders, and the same are valid
grounds for refusal to carry plaintiffs in accordance with its Domestic
Passenger Tariff No. 2 (Section A, Rule 8[a]) which is incorporated by
reference into the conditions of carriage as expressly provided for in
plaintiffs' plane tickets'; and that the error of its employees was an honest
mistake or constitutes excusable negligence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After trial on the merits, specifically on June 25, 1975, the
lower court rendered a decision which, in part, is herein reproduced as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘In the case of Ortigas vs. Lufthansa (Case Digest of the Bulletin

from P100,000.00 to P150,000.00 and the exemplary damages from P30,000.00 to
P100,000.00.  The ground of the Supreme
Court in ordering the increase of the exemplary damages from P30,000.00 to
P100,000.00, was that, 'the airline should be made to pay an amount that can
really serve as a deterrent against a seeming pattern of indifference and

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, on appeal respondent court affirmed with
modifications said decision of the lower court.  Hence, this petition raising the following questions:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is a passenger in a contract of air
transportation entitled to moral damages when the failure of the carrier to
accommodate the passenger resulted from unlawful acts of third parties against
the carrier's personnel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are respondents entitled to exemplary
damages when there is no sufficient evidence to show, and neither the appellate
court nor the trial court found facts showing reckless, oppressive or
malevolent conduct by the carrier?</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can a passenger in a contract of air
transportation validly claim damages when she could have taken the flight had she
not instead opted, of her own volition, to give her confirmed seat to another
passenger who was accommodated by the carrier in her place?</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>May a trial court, in a motion for
reconsideration, increase damages it awarded in the original decision to an amount
drastically over that it initially found to be warranted and significantly more
than claimed by plaintiffs themselves?<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have constantly ruled in a number of cases that moral damages
are recoverable in a breach of contract of carriage where the air carrier
through its agents acted fraudulently or in bad faith.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the trial court and the Court of Appeals are in agreement
that petitioner through its agents acted in bad faith in "bumping
off" private respondents.  As aptly
found by the Court of Appeals, the failure of petitioner to accommodate private
respondents was not the result of an honest mistake, because its employees knew
and were aware that what they were doing was wrong.  Hence, respondent court held that there was a "dishonest
purpose" and "conscious doing of wrong" on the part of
petitioner's employees in "bumping off" private respondents from the
flight; and that the lower court did not err in holding that the failure of
petitioner to accommodate private respondents on Flight 296R was attended by
bad faith.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The said pronouncement was based on the following findings in the
decision of the trial court, which we are not inclined to disturb, the same
having evidentiary foundation:</p>

<blockquote>"The employees of the defendant knew that there was a heavy
booking of passengers on November 26, 1970 because of the coming of the
Pope.  Why did the Virac station
overbooked (sic) two passengers, Gov. Alberto and Mayor Antonio, on Flight
296R, knowing all the time that these two passengers could not possibly obtain
confirmed reservations in Naga?  Knowing
further the political stature of Gov. Alberto, Mr. Borjal, the branch
supervisor of Virac, should had (sic) foreseen that should Gov. Alberto and
Mayor Antonio refuse to deplane in Naga, should they fail to obtain confirmed
reservations, he (Borjal) would create a situation wherein the defendant would
be placed in a position to violate its contract of carriage with passengers
with confirmed reservations who would not be accommodated because of Gov. Alberto
and Mayor Antonio.  This whole incident
could have been avoided had Borjal not recklessly took (sic) a chance on the
two overbooked passengers in getting confirmed reservation in Naga.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The situation was, however, aggravated by the employees of
the defendant at Pili airport, particularly Mr. Azuela who seemed to be the one
who was making decisions at the airport.  Knowing already that Flight 296R was overbooked by two passengers and
the allocations in Legaspi and Naga were also fully booked of passengers with
confirmed reservations and plaintiffs were begging and pleading to be allowed
to take Flight 296R as they had confirmed reservations and the luggage of Mrs.
Bagadiong and Miss Sto. Tomas were already loaded in the plane, Mr. Azuela and
his co-employees still allowed and gave preference to the two passengers (Fr.
Laban and Miss Franca) to board and take Flight 296R notwithstanding the fact
that Mr. Azuela and his co-employees at the airport knew and was (sic) aware at
that time that the Sorsogon branch had no allocation in Flight 296R and that
the flight of the Sorsogon passengers was already cancelled earlier.  The employees of the defendant knowingly and
deliberately disregarded the rights of the plaintiffs to board the plane and
took (sic) Flight 296R by virtue of their being holders of tickets duly issued
and paid for with confirmed reservations on Flight 296R.  The employees of the defendant knew that by
not allowing the plaintiffs to take Flight 296R they were violating the
contract of carriage the defendant had with the plaintiffs.  Even granting all the mistakes advanced by
the defendant, still there would at least be negligence so gross and reckless
that it amounts to malice or bad faith in its breach of contract with the
plaintiffs (Lopez, et al. versus Pan American World Airways, No. L?22415,
March 30, 1966, citing Fores vs. Miranda, L-12163, March 4, 1959; Necesito vs.
Paras, L-10605, June 30, 1958, 16 SCRA 431).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The argument that the Sorsogon pas­sengers arrived first and
checked in earlier than the plaintiffs at the airport ticket counter of the
defendant is not a valid reason to give them preference over the plaintiffs
considering that the latter had confirmed reservations and they arrived on time
at the airport and checked in at the defendant's ticket counter.  If issuance of tickets duly paid for and
with confirmed reservations is no guarantee that the passengers to whom it is
(sic) issued would be accommodated, then air passengers would be placed in the
hollow of the hands of the airlines and its employees.  What security then can a passenger
have?  x x x"<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u>Korean Airlines, Co., Ltd. vs. Hon. Court of
Appeals, et al.</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
with a similar factual setting, we held:</p>

<blockquote>"We are satisfied from the findings of the respondent court
(and of the trial court) that the private respondent was, in the language of
the airline industry, 'bumped off'.  She
had a confirmed ticket.  She arrived at
the airport on time.  However, she was
not allowed to board because her seat had already been given to another
passenger.  As a result, she suffered
damages for which the petitioner should be held liable."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A contract to transport passengers is quite different in kind and
degree from any other contractual relation.  And this, because of the relation which an air-carrier sustains with the
public.  Its business is mainly with the
travelling public.  It invites people to
avail of the comforts and advantages it offers.  The contract of air carriage, therefore, generates a relation
attended with a public duty.  Neglect or
malfeasance of the carrier's employees naturally could give ground for an
action for damages.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The operation of a common carrier is a business affected with
public interest and must be directed to serve the comfort and convenience of
the passengers.  In case of breach in
bad faith of a contract of carriage, award of damages is in order.  We have ruled that bad faith which would
justify an award of moral and exemplary damages for breach of contract of
carriage means a breach of a known duty through some motive of interest or
ill-will.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
That pronouncement is applicable to these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of petitioner that its failure to accommodate
private respondents was due to the unlawful acts of third persons and,
therefore, constitutes <u>caso</u> <u>fortuito</u>, is untenable.  To constitute a <u>caso</u> <u>fortuito</u>
that would exempt a person from responsibility, it is essential that (a) the
event must be independent of the will of the obligor; (b) it must be either
unforseeable or inevitable; (c) its occurrence renders it impossible for the
obligor to fulfill his obligation in a normal manner; and (d) the obligor must
be free from any participation in the aggravation of the injury resulting to
the obligee or creditor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One essential characteristic of a fortuitous event is that it was
independent of the will of the obligor or of his employees, which fact is
lacking in this case.  The alleged
fortuitous event, supposedly consisting of the unlawful acts of Governor
Alberto and Mayor Antonio, is not independent of the will of herein petitioner
as the obligor but was caused by the very act of its agents in allowing the
governor and the mayor to board Flight 296R in excess of the number of
passengers allotted to them and with full knowledge that the said flight for
Manila was fully booked.  The
impossibility of their being accommodated was necessarily forseeable.  The claim of petitioner that there was a
prior arrangement between its agent in Virac and the governor and the mayor
that the latter would be accommodated only up to Naga is belied by the
passengers' manifest wherein it is stated that the place of destination of both
the governor and the mayor was Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>Again, we quote respondent Court of Appeals:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The fear spoken of by witness Azuela is speculative, fanciful
and remote.  The statement attributed to
Governor Alberto and/or the mayors, that ‘if we cannot board the plane there
will be something that will happen’, is vague.  The threat, if ever it was, was not of such a serious character and
imminence as to create in the mind of defendant-appellant's employees fear of
greater injury if they would not allow Governor Alberto and the mayors to
remain in the plane which was then scheduled to fly to Manila.  It is difficult to believe that Governor
Alberto and the mayors would make any threat or intimidation to keep their
seats in the plane.  They were
provincial and municipal executives with a common duty to maintain peace and
order and to prevent the commission of crimes.  The cited cases involving Hukbalahaps and robbers are misplaced, because
they are known to ruthless killers whose intimidation or the violence they
employed is sufficient to produce in the mind of their victims real, imminent
or reasonable fear.  As correctly
observed by the lower court from the evidence of record, defendant?appellant's
employees 'bumped off' plaintiffs from the flight in their desire ‘to cater to
the good graces of a politico’ (Governor Alberto)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's agents, by giving permission to board Flight 296R to
persons who were not among those with valid confirmations and who consequently
had no right to be given preference in taking said flight, deliberately created
a situation that would place, as it did place, petitioner in arrant violation
of its contract with private respondents who were "bumped off" by
reason thereof.  Petitioner, having
unlawfully deprived private respondents of their seats, without any regard at
all to their feelings and convenience just so it could accommodate other persons
who had no better right thereto, cannot now relieve itself from liability by
invoking a fortuitous event, a defense as erroneous as it is contrived.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we stressed in <u>Ortigas, Jr. vs. Lufthansa German Airlines</u>:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"x x x Nobody, much less a common carrier who is under
constant special obligation to give utmost consideration to the convenience of
its customers, may be permitted to relieve itself from any difficult situation
created by its own lack of diligence in the conduct of its affairs in a manner
prejudicial to such customers.  It is
Our considered view that when it comes to contracts of common carriage,
inattention and lack of care on the part of the carrier resulting in the
failure of the passenger to be accommodated in the class contracted for amounts
to bad faith or fraud which entitles the passengers to the award of moral
damages in accordance with Article 2220 of the Civil Code.  x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find no error on the part of respondent Court of
Appeals in awarding moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney's
fees.  The findings that petitioner had
breached its contract of carriage in bad faith and in wanton disregard of
private respondents' rights as passengers lay the basis and justification for
such awards.  The imposition of
exemplary damages is necessary to deter petitioner or other airlines from
committing similar breaches of contract in the future, although there are still
reported instances thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the third issue, we also find the same to be
without merit for being based on specious and strained reasoning.  The fact that respondent Bagadiong
relinquished her seat in favor of her son is of no moment, considering that her
son was also a confirmed passenger who had a right to demand accommodation from
petitioner.  As noted by respondent
court, the act of respondent Bagadiong was motivated solely by her concern for
her son who also risked being denied accommodation but who was then returning
to school in Manila.  Such sacrifice was
not voluntary on her part, and her inability to take the flight was the
consequence of the wrongful act of petitioner's employees for which it has to
answer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the last issue regarding the propriety of the lower court's
increasing the award of damages it awarded in the original decision,
petitioner's allegation that respondent court passed upon the matter <u>sub</u>
<u>silentio</u> is not correct.  Respondent court precisely resolved said issue by modifying the decision
of the lower court, awarding each respondent instead an aggregate amount of
P30,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages, plus P6,000.00 as attorney's
fees.  The award of moral and exemplary
damages in an aggregate amount may not be the usual way of awarding said
damages.  However, there can be no
question that the entitlement to moral damages having been established,
exemplary damages may be awarded; and exemplary damages may be awarded even
though not so expressly pleaded in the complaint nor proved.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can petitioner accurately claim that the award made by
respondent court exceeded the amounts prayed for by responents Bagadiong and
Sto. Tomas in their complaint.  A
reading of said complaint shows that only their claims for moral damages and
attorney's fees were limited to P20,000.00 and P6,000.00, respectively; the
award of exemplary damages was left to the discretion of the lower court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The amount of exemplary damages need not be pleaded in the
complaint because the same cannot be pre­-determined.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
One can merely ask that it be determined by the court as the evidence may
warrant and be awarded at its discretion.  This is exactly what private respondents did.  Awards for moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's
fees are left to the sound discretion of the court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

1988, with said counsel informing the Court that decedent's surviving heirs are
Salvacion Sto. Tomas Gerona and Cecilia Sto. Tomas Pardo, both with addresses
