				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeks to set aside
and annul the decision dated <st1:date month="7" day="29" year="1982">July 29,
 1982</st1:date> of respondent Employees' Compensation Commission (ECC) in ECC
Case No. 1524, which affirmed the decision of respondent Government Service
Insurance System, denying petitioner's claim for compensation benefits under
the New Labor Code, for disability and subsequent death of Leticia Mora.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed factual background is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The late Leticia Mora was from 1963 until <st1:date month="12" day="25" year="1979">December 25, 1979</st1:date> a telegraph operator of the
Bureau of Telecommunications in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the course of her employment, and more
particularly in January 1978, she complained of frequent <span class="SpellE">epigastric</span>
pain radiating to the <span class="SpellE">periumbilical</span> region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Biopsy conducted at the <st1:city><st1:place>St.
  Paul</st1:place></st1:city>'s Hospital in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
revealed a diagnosis of <span class="SpellE">adnocarcinoma</span> of the <span class="SpellE">ileocaecal</span> junction (a certain portion of the small
intestine).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She underwent
"exploratory <span class="SpellE">laparotomy</span> with resection of <span class="SpellE">ileocaecal</span> junction" but her ailment continued to
recur.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She filed a claim for disability
benefits under PD 626, as amended, with respondent Government Service Insurance
System (GSIS).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claim was, however,
denied by the GSIS on the ground that her ailment is not an occupational
disease considering her particular employment as telegraph operator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied, she sent a letter to the
Chairman of respondent Employees' Compensation Commission (ECC) Minister <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>, requesting for a
review of her case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She averred that her
cancer should be considered by the system as work-connected since she acquired
the same during her sixteen (16) years of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="11" day="22" year="1980">Nov.
 22, 1980</st1:date>, Leticia Mora died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her appeal to the ECC which was prosecuted by her husband after her
death, was denied, the ECC ruling that the illness which caused Leticia Mora's
death is not work-connected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition which <span class="GramE">We</span> find to be
meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law applicable to the case at bar is the New Labor Code, PD
442, as amended, which covers injury, sickness, disability or death occurring
on or after January 1, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The new law
on employee's compensation makes compensable disability or death arising from
an ailment under any of the following grounds namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) when the illness is definitely accepted as
an occupational disease by the Employees' Compensation Commission, or (b) when
said illness is caused by employment subject to proof that the risk of
contracting the same is increased by the work conditions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the New Labor Code particularly Art. 167 (1) as amended by
PD 1368, defining compensable illness, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"(1) "Sickness' means any illness definitely accepted as
occupational disease listed by the Commission, or any illness caused by
employment subject to proof that the risk of contracting the same is increased
by working conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose,
the Commission is empowered to determine and approve occupational diseases and
work-related illnesses that may be considered compensable based on peculiar
hazards of employment." <span class="GramE">(As amended by Sec. 1, PD 1368).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Implementing the foregoing provision, the Employees' Compensation
Commission promulgated its amended Rules, Section 1(b), Rule III, of which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 1(b) <span class="GramE">For</span> the sickness and the
resulting disability or death to be compensable, the sickness must be the
result of an occupational disease listed under "ANNEX "A" of
these Rules with the conditions set therein satisfied, otherwise, proof must be
shown that the risk of contracting the disease is increased by the working conditions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The cause of the decedent's <span class="GramE">death,</span> is
not listed in said Annex "A" as occupational disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To be compensable thereby the law requires
that the risk of contracting the disease is increased by the employment of the
de-deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this requisite proof
can be given only if the cause of the disease- cancer- can itself be
known.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, despite scientific
advances on the matter, even professional experts have not as yet <span class="GramE">determine</span> its cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All that they can say regarding the ailment of the deceased is the following:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Adenocarcinoma</span>, <span class="SpellE">ileocaecal</span>
junction is malignancy affecting a certain portion of the small intestines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Carcinoma of the small intestine occurs more frequently in the male
sex with the highest incidence in the fourth, fifth and sixth decades.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Histologically</span>,
these carcinomas are classified into four types:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">adenocarcinoma</span>, <span class="SpellE">medullary</span>, <span class="SpellE">scirrhous</span> and colloid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The clinical manifestations are variable and depend upon the
location, size and character of the tumor and the degree of malignancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are predominantly those of intestinal
obstruction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A history of abdominal
distress and pain is frequent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
tumor becomes sufficiently large, a movable, palpable mass may be present."

854).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Cited in
Comment of respondent ECC, p. 34).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As stated in Our decisions in Mercado, Jr. v. Employees
Compensation Commission, 139 SCRA 270 citing <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
v. ECC, 103 SCRA 329, and <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Nemaria</span>, v. Employees' Compensation Commission and
Government Service Insurance System (Ministry of Education and Culture
promulgated on October 28, 1987, the necessity of proof is present only when
the cause of the disease is known.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
not known, there is no duty to present proof, for the law does not demand <span class="GramE">an impossibility</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus in the Mercado, Jr. v. Employees Compensation Commission <span class="SpellE">Commission</span> case, <span class="GramE">We</span> held:</p>

<blockquote>"While the presumption of compensability and the theory of
aggravation espoused under the Workmen's Compensation Act may have abandoned
under the New Labor Code (the constitutionality of such abrogation may still be
challenged), it is significant that the liberality of the law in general still
subsists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As
agents charged by the law to implement social justice guaranteed and secured by
both 1935 and 1973 Constitutions, respondents should adopt a more liberal
attitude in deciding claims for compensability especially where there is some
basis in the facts for inferring a work connection, 103 SCRA 329, 336).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Where however, the causes of an ailment are unknown to and or undetermined even
by medical science, the requirement of proof of any casual link between the
ailment and the working conditions should be liberalized so that those who have
less in life will have more in law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
point is that it is grossly inequitable to require as a condition for an award
of compensation that the claimant demonstrate that his ailment - the cause or
origin of which is unknown to and undetermined even by medical science - was,
in fact caused or the risk of contracting the same enhanced by his working
conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plainly, the condition would
be an impossible one, specially considering that said claimant is most probably
not even conversant with the intricacies of medical science and the claimant
invariably bereft of the material resources to employ medical experts to
demonstrate the connection between the cause and the disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the liberal character of
employment compensation schemes, the impossible condition should be deemed as
not having been intended and/or imposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(139 SCRA, pp. 275-276).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">As</span> an employee, he had contributed to the funds of
respondent for 34 years until his forced retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In turn respondent should comply with its
duty to give him the fullest protection, relief and compensation benefits as
guaranteed by law." <span class="GramE">(Ibid., pp. 277).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the more recent case of <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Nemaria</span>, v. Employees' Compensation Commission and
Government Service Insurance System (Ministry of Education and Culture), <u>supra</u>)
we stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"Thus the requirement that the disease was caused or
aggravated by the employment or work applies only to an illness where the cause
can be determined or proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where cause
is unknown or cannot be ascertained, no duty to prove the link exists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For certainly, the law cannot demand <span class="GramE">an impossibility</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED,</b> the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the respondent Employees
Compensation Commission is SET ASIDE and another is rendered ordering the
respondents to pay the herein petitioner the full amount of compensation under
Presidential Decree No. 626 as amended.</p>
