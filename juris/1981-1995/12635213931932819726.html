This is a petition for review filed by the spouses Jose Salgado and 
Julieta Salgado to set aside the resolution of the then Court of Appeals
 in CA-G.R. No. SP-09407-R, dated September 18, 1980, which authorized 
the issuance of a writ of attachment against the property of said 
petitioners.
<p>
The pertinent facts that gave rise to this petition are as follows:  On 
May 8, 1978, the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank, hereinafter 
referred to as the Bank, filed an action against petitioners, docketed 
as Civil Case No. 29392 of the then Court of First Instance of Rizal, to
 recover on a promissory note in the amount of P1,510,905.96, inclusive 
of interest and other bank charges.  In its verified complaint, the Bank
 further prayed for the issuance of a writ of attachment.  As grounds 
therefor it alleged that petitioners had fraudently misappropriated 
and/or converted to their own personal use and benefit the sugar 
proceeds given as security for the payment of the indebtedness; that 
petitioners are guilty of fraud in contracting their obligation and have
 concealed, removed or disposed of the properties mortgaged or assigned 
to the plaintiff, or are concealing, removing or disposing or about to 
do so, with intent to defraud their creditor; that the obligation sought
 to be enforced is genuine and, therefore, a sufficient cause of action 
exists; and that there is no sufficient security for the claim sought to
 be enforced by the action.  Attached to the complaint was the affidavit
 of Mrs. Helen Osias, Senior Branch Credit Division Manager of the Bank,
 wherein she stated, among others, "that there is no sufficient security
 for the claim sought to be enforced by this action."
</p><p>
On May 9, 1978, the trial court issued an order granting the Bank's 
prayer for preliminary attachment upon a bond in the sum of 
P1,510,905.96.  Upon the filing of said bond, the Deputy Provincial 
Sheriff levied upon several parcels of land of pe­titioners situated in 
the province of Negros Occidental.
</p><p>
On September 15, 1978, petitioners Salgado moved to quash the writ of 
attachment on the ground that respondent Bank made fraudulent 
misrepresentation in securing the writ by deleting the words "R E M" or 
"Real Estate Mortgage" from the xerox copy of the promissory note 
attached to the complaint, thereby "making it appear that the note was 
unsecured when in truth and in fact it was fully secured by a series of 
valid and existing real estate mortgages duly registered and annotated 
in the titles of the affected real properties in favor of the plaintiff 
Bank." In the same motion, petitioners stressed the lack of factual 
basis of the Bank's claim as to their alleged fraudulent 
misappropriation or conversion of the sugar proceeds given as security 
for their obli­gation.
</p><p>
After due hearing, the trial court issued an order dated January 31, 
1979 granting petitioners' motion and lifting the writ of attachment 
previously issued.
</p><p>
Upon denial of its motion for reconsideration the Bank went to the Court
 of Appeals on a petition for certiorari to annul the order of the trial
 court lifting the writ of attachment.
</p><p>
On November 29, 1979, the respondent Court of Appeals, finding that the 
order of the trial court was not arbitrarily issued, dismissed the 
petition for lack of merit.
</p><p>
However, on motion of the Bank, the respondent Court reconsidered its 
decision of November 29, 1979 and issued the questioned resolution dated
 September 18, 1980, which authorized the issuance of a writ of 
attachment.
</p><p>
Hence, the present recourse.
</p><p>
We find the petition impressed with merit.  The chief purpose of the 
remedy of attachment is to secure a contingent lien on defendant's 
property until plaintiff can, by appropriate proceedings, obtain a 
judgment and have such property applied to its satisfaction, or to make 
some provision for unsecured debts in cases where the means of 
satis­faction thereof are liable to be removed beyond the jurisdiction, 
or improperly disposed of or concealed, or otherwise placed beyond the 
reach of creditors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
The grounds upon which attachment may issue are set forth in Section 1, 
Rule 57 of the Rules of Court.  But quite apart from the grounds stated 
therein, it is further provided in Section 3 of Rule 57 that "an order 
of attachment shall be granted only when it is made to appear by the 
affidavit of the applicant or some other person who personally knows the
 facts, that x x x there is no other sufficient security for the claim 
sought to be en­forced by the action."
</p><p>
The reason for the rule prohibiting attachment where indebtedness was 
already secured is to prevent the secured creditors from attaching 
additional property and thus tying up more of the debtor's property than
 was necessary to secure the indebtedness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  Thus, to sustain an order of attachment, "it is incumbent upon 
plaintiff to establish either of these two facts, to wit:  (a) that the 
obligation had not been secured originally, or (b) that, if secured at 
its beginning, the security later became valueless."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
In the instant case, the allegation in the affidavit of the Bank's 
Credit Division Manager, Mrs. Helen Osias, to the effect that "there is 
no sufficient security for the claim sought to be enforced by this 
action" has been shown to be false.  It is undisputed that the note sued
 upon "is fully secured by a series of valid and existing real estate 
mortgages duly registered and annotated in the titles of the affected 
real property in favor of the plaintiff Bank."
</p><p>
Section 13, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court authorizes the discharge of an
 attachment where the same had been improperly or irregularly issued.  
In National Coconut Corporation vs. Hon. Potenciano Pecson,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  this Court ruled that when the facts or some of them, stated in the 
plaintiff's affidavit, are shown by the defendant to be untrue, the writ
 of attachment may be considered as improperly or irregularly issued.
</p><p>
Since attachment is a harsh and rigorous remedy which exposes the debtor
 to humiliation and annoyance, the rule authorizing its issuance must be
 strictly construed in favor of the defendant.  It should not be abused 
as to cause unnecessary prejudice.  It is the duty of the court before 
issuing the writ to en­sure that all the requisites of the law has been 
com­plied with.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
Accordingly, the resolution of the respondent Court of Appeals, now the 
Intermediate Appellate Court, dated September 18, 1980, is hereby set 
aside.  No costs.
SO ORDERED.

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
AQUINO, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I dissent with deference to Justice Escolin's opinion. On May 8, 1978, 
the Philippine Commercial &amp; Industrial Bank filed an ordinary action
 against the Salgado spouses (residents of Kabankalan, Negros 
Occidental) in the Court of First Instance of Pasig, Rizal for the 
collection of the sum of P1,510,905.96 as the debt due from the Salgado 
spouses on their loan for the crop-year 1975-76, with a prayer for a 
writ of attachment, considering that there was allegedly no sufficient 
security for the debt.
</p><p>
The attachment was granted by Judge Nelly L. Romero Valdellon on the 
following day, May 9, subject to the filing of a bond in the amount of 
the obligation, P1,510,905.96. The Salgados moved to quash it on the 
ground that there was misrepresentation on the part of the bank that 
there was no security for the loan. They charged that the bank tampered 
with the promissory note by erasing the acronym "REM" (meaning real 
estate mortgages), thus giving the false impression that there was no 
security.
</p><p>
The bank countered that it did not resort to foreclosure because the 
mortgages (Exh. 6 to 10) covered not only the debt of the Salgados for 
the crop-year 1975-76 but also their obligations for the crop-years 
1976-77 and 1977-78 and an additional commercial loan. The Salgados 
admitted that they did not assign to the bank their sugar for the 
1975-­76 crop-year. That was why the loan was not paid.
</p><p>
On January 31, 1979, Judge Valdellon dissolved the attachment. About a month later, Julieta Chua Salgado <em>transferred four pieces of real property covered by the attachment to her sisters </em>Jimema Chua Ang and Soledad Chua Montilla, her brother Romeo G. Chua and her daughter, Mary Jane Salgado.
</p><p>
The bank assailed the dissolution order by certiorari in the Court of 
Appeals. In a decision dated November 29, 1979, Justices Nocon, Samuel 
F. Reyes and Victoriano upheld the dissolution order because the bank 
allegedly acted fraudulently in tampering with the note, making it 
appear that the loan was unsecured when in fact it was secured by 
mortgages.
</p><p>
The bank filed a motion for reconsideration. In the resolution of 
September 18, 1980, the same three Justices set aside their decision and
 sustained the attachment. They held that the dissolution was made on 
grounds not mentioned in section 13 of Rule 57.
</p><p>
The Salgados appealed to this Court on Decem­ber 3, 1980. <em>The instant appeal was dismissed for lack of merit in this Court's resolution of June 26, 1981</em>. The Salgados filed a motion for reconsideration wherein they stated that Judge Valdellon in a decision dated <em>July 15, 1981</em>
 dismissed the bank's complaint and ordered it to pay the Salgados one 
million two hundred fifty thousand pesos as moral and exemplary damages 
and attorney's fees.
</p><p>
The bank opposed the motion. In a manifestation dated June 10, 1982, it 
apprised this Court that Judge Pineda issued an order dated January 4, 
1982 wherein he set aside Judge Valdellon's decision and ordered the 
Salgados to pay the bank P1,300,000 plus interest and penalties, bank 
charges and attorney's fees as stipulated in the promissory note, 
Exhibit A. Judge Pineda denied the Salgados' motion for reconsideration.
 (The Salgados appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court, AC-G. R. 
No. 00119.)
</p><p>
I am of the opinion that the writ of attachment was properly issued. It 
is supported by a sufficient bond. The bank posted a bond of 
P1,510,905.96. The 1981 resolution dismissing the instant appeal should 
be reaffirmed.
