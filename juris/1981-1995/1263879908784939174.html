was charged on two counts with violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) Criminal Case No. C-2790,
for having been found on July 7, 1988 in possession, custody and control of 198
foils of marijuana leaves placed in a 1,300 gram milk can and 1 bundle of
marijuana leaves attached to their branches weighing 50 grams, and (2) Criminal
Case No. C-2791, for having sold 2 foils of dried marijuana leaves on <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was acquitted in Criminal Case No. 2790
but convicted in Criminal Case No. 2791 in the Decision of the trial court, the
pertinent portions of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For the charge of selling marijuana, the prosecution
presented a case of a successful 'test-buy' operation on <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1988</st1:date> where the accused was entrapped into
selling and delivering to NARCOM operatives two (2) packets of dried marijuana
leaves in consideration of twenty pesos (P20.00) paid to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His defense to this is plain denial,
asserting by his uncorroborated testimony that at the time he was just at their
house, that nothing untoward happened, and that he did not sell marijuana to
S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span> or <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the accused implies that he could
not have been entrapped as he already knew S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span>
<span style="">to be a NARCOM </span>agent having been
so informed by the latter himself when they last met in June 1988." (p.
20, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence upon which the finding of guilt beyond
reasonable doubt was based is narrated by the trial court thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Narcotics Command operatives for Region 6 after conducting
surveillance in Pres. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>
came to suspect the accused as a violator of the dangerous drugs law;
accordingly in the morning of July 6, 1988 team members S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span> and S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Dande</span> <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span> approached the
accused at his house in Campo <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of said place
on a 'test-buy' operation where, over a bamboo slats fence, S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span> posing as a buyer transacted with the accused for
the purchase from him of marijuana, with S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span>
as observer; after agreeing on the sale S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span>
gave to the accused a P20.00 bill and the latter went inside their house, and
when he returned shortly the accused handed to S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span>
two (2) packets of the supposed marijuana sold, and which later were confirmed
to be marijuana leaves by the NARCOM operatives on field examination and by a
forensic chemist in laboratory tests (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'E' &amp;
'E-4'); when asked, the accused answered that he had plenty more of the stuff
available for disposal; the NARCOM agents then applied for and were issued a
search warrant (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A') by Judge Orlando <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> in the morning of July 7, 1988 covering the said
house and premises of the accused; in serving this they first passed by and
requested the assistance of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain and
four (4) PC men served the warrant and, in the company of the accused and his
mother, conducted the search particularly in the second floor of their house,
the yard and a <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut within the premises and two
(2) meters away from the house; the search yielded one (1) milk can (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'E-2') with one hundred ninety-nine (199) packets
containing dried marijuana leaves and a plastic bundle (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'E-3') containing dried marijuana leaves; the items seized were inventoried and
receipted (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B') and signed (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span class="GramE">'B-1 &amp; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">‘B-3'); the conduct of the search certified to (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
‘C'), and these were signed among others by the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain, the accused and his mother, the NARCOM agents brought the accused and
the seized items before Judge Orlando <span class="SpellE">Relanoto</span> whom
they submitted a return of the search (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'D'), and
requested for the custody of the items (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'D-2)
for laboratory tests, which was granted (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'D-4') and receipted for (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
'D-6'); the items seized during the search and that sold by the accused during
the ‘test-buy' the day before were forthwith brought to the PC/INP Crime
Laboratory Service in Iloilo City and examined by its forensic chemist P/Lt. <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Sinfuego</span>; the laboratory
tests conducted on the specimens now marked as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'E-2', ‘E-3’, and 'E-4' showed that these were marijuana (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As can be gathered from
the foregoing assigned errors, the issue in this appeal is again the
credibility of witnesses, that is, whether or not the trial court was correct
in giving more weight to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses than to the
testimony of the accused-appellant and his witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the matter of credibility of witnesses, the rule is
well-settled that "unless there is a showing that the trial court had
overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and
substance that would have affected the result of the case, the appellate court
will not disturb the factual findings of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, having had the opportunity of observing
the demeanor and behavior of the witnesses while testifying, the trial court,
more than the reviewing tribunal, is in a better position to <span style="">gauge </span>their credibility and properly
appreciate the relative weight of the often conflicting evidence for both
parties." (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ablaza</span>, 30 SCRA 173; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Lamosa</span>, 173 SCRA 518) We apply this legal tenet to
the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if such
principle were not invoked the fact is that the appellant failed to controvert
the more credible evidence of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution, through its four (4) witnesses, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NARCOM agents <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Lavitan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dande</span> <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span> and <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bawafe</span>, had positively
established, by clear and convincing evidence, that appellant had committed the
offense of selling marijuana to the NARCOM agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged inconsistencies and
contradictions in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses, pointed out by
the appellant in his brief, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span> testified that he and S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span>
applied for the issuance of a search warrant on July 6, 1988 immediately after
the test buy operation while S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span>
testified that they applied for said warrant, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'A', on July 7, 1988 (supra, page 7, Brief);</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span> testified that in each wrapper of the two (2)
foils of marijuana, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'E-4', he bought from the
accused-appellant, he affixed his handwriting to identify said <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'E-4' (supra, page 7, Brief) whereas, on the other
hand, on cross examination, T/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lavitan</span> testified
that when S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span> gave to him <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'E-4', he examined himself <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span style="">'E-4' </span>and had not noticed any
marking or seen any writing on the wrappers of said exhibits (supra, page 10,
Brief);</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That during the test-buy
on July 6, 1988, S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span> when asked by the
trial court testified that their team leader, T/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lavitan</span>,
was staying in their <span class="SpellE">safehouse</span> almost 300 meters away
from the house of the accused-appellant (supra, page 4, Brief) which testimony
was contradicted by S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span> in his testimony
on cross-examination that T/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lavitan</span> was in <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City (39 kilometers from the Municipality of
President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>) who
instructed them to conduct a test-buy operation at President <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> on July 6, 1988
(supra, page 8, Brief);</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span> testified that accused-appellant surrendered a
bundle of dried marijuana leaves, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'E-3', to
S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span> (supra, page 3, Brief) whereas,
according to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain it was S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span> who found or discovered <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'E-3' on top of the bamboo post of the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut
(supra, page 5, Brief) refer to minor and insignificant details which cannot
destroy the credibility of the said prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>,
135 SCRA 84; People v. <span class="SpellE">Dava</span>, 149 SCRA 582; People v. <span class="SpellE">Ranola</span>, 172 SCRA 43) In fact such minor inconsistencies
guarantee sincere and candid evidence (not manufactured perjury) of what must
have actually happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> evidence consists of mere
denials which constitute self-serving negative evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, these denials cannot be given greater
evidentiary weight than the declaration of credible witnesses who testify on
affirmative matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v.
Rodriguez, 172 SCRA 742)</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find no justification to overturn the following
findings of the trial court -</p>

<blockquote>"The Court considers, however, that these four (4)
eye-witnesses could not possibly have a fully uniform perception nor <span style="">recall </span>of things and that - their
differences oh these and other details notwithstanding - they are all in
positive agreement that packaged and loose marijuana contained in the milk can
and bundle were recovered during the search.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted that the discrepancies mentioned refer to testimonies
on events occurring after the 'test-buy' operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But independently of and isolated from this,
the testimonies of S/<span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Deocampo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Magwale</span> anent and centered on the sale and
purchase of marijuana on July 6, 1988 are homogeneous, unsullied, and
credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Warnings have been made
against law enforcers who, in frustration or to enhance their service image,
would connive and fabricate cases against notorious drug violators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That cannot be said in these charges where
the NARCOM agents sought first judicial processes and involved in their
operations the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain and local PC men whom
they met for the first time just minutes before they set off after the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus taking the foregoing into account and after scrupulously
separating the evidentiary grain from the chaff, the Court still finds that
there is strong and convincing evidence that the accused sold and delivered to
NARCOM operatives on July 6, 1988 two (2) packets of marijuana for the purchase
price of twenty pesos (P20.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
search for and recovery of a hefty amount of marijuana from the accused a day
later and from the same place, confirms this sale and the nefarious activities
of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His possession of such
bulk cannot but indicate his intention to sell, distribute and deliver
marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">vide</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pp. v. Toledo, 140 SCRA 25).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defenses set up by the accused are weak and hollow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His bare denial that he did not sell
marijuana to the NARCOM operatives on July 6, 1988 cannot be hoped on to
overcome their positive assertions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘The
well-entrenched principle is that greater weight is given to the positive
testimony of the prosecution witness than the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
denial.’ (Pp. v. Khan, 161 SCRA 406)." (pp. 21-22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a last ditch effort to avoid <span style="">criminal </span>liability, appellant claims that the prosecution <span style="">filed </span>the cases against him to
cover-up for the money taken by the team in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,380.00</span>
(p. 2 Appellant's Brief).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's allegation is completely unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on record shows that the
searching team did not conceal the money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was reported and <span style="">handed </span>to
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain, duly accounted for <span style="">and </span>repeatedly counted in the
open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 21-23, TSN, Feb. 16,
1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, as pointed out by <span style="">the </span>Solicitor General, credit must be
accorded to <span style="">the </span>testimonies of
the buy-bust operation and searching team.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To legalize the operation and avoid suspicion, they sought judicial
process in applying for a search warrant, involving in the search no less than
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The seized items in the <span style="">possession
</span>of appellant confirmed that the latter <span style="">was </span>engaged in the sale and distribution of <span style="">marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
