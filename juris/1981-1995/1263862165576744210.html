<p class="BODY">Delfin Bustos, his uncle Engracio Bustos <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">alias “Gracing," and Pablito Bungay alias "Roger Pogi,"
were charged with murder in Criminal Case No. 6498 of the Court of First
Instance of Pampanga in an amended </span>Information dated June 17, 1969 which
alleged:</p>

<blockquote><i>"That on or about the 18th day of September, 1968, at
barrio San Matias, </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">municipality
of </span>Sto. Tomas, province </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
</span>Pampanga, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Hon. Court,
the above named accused Delfin </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Bustos,
</span>Pablito Bungay </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">alias </span>'Roger
Pogi,' and </i><i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Engracio</span></u></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <u>Bustos</u> </span>alias 'Gracing,' with
deliberate intent to kill, nighttime purposely sought to facilitate the
commission of the offense, conspiring together and mutually helping one
another, with treachery, evident premeditation, and with grave abuse</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>of superior strength, did then and
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously fire at and shoot Cristorey Lopez
with a firearm, caliber .22, inflicting mortal and fatal injuries upon the said
Cristorey Lopez, the bullet entering the right chest, lacerating the upper and
lower lobes of the left lungs, and which injuries caused the death of the said
Cristorey Lopez shortly thereafter," </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(p. 7. </span>Rollo.)</i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon being arraigned on August 11, 1969, Delfin Bustos and
Engracio Bustos pleaded “not guilty.” The third accused Pablito Bungay, alias
"Roger Pogi," has not yet been apprehended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the evidence presented at the trial, the court
found the following facts to have been established:</p>

<p class="BODY">Between six and seven o'clock in the evening of September 18,
1968, Cristorey Lopez was shot inside the compound of the Lopez Apartments owned
by his family in Sitio Moras, San Matias, Sto. Tomas, Pampanga.</p>

<p class="BODY">The incident was witnessed by Rodolfo Ortoleza, a thirteen-year
old boy who lives with his sister Cora in one of the Lopez apartments, for the
compound was well illumined with electric bulbs.  From a distance of about one arm's length (isang dipa), he
watched as "Roger Pogi" bodily dragged Cristorey Lopez out of the
fourth apartment which was occupied by two taxi-dancers named Tessie and Lita
who were the common law wives of Engracio Bustos and Delfin Bustos,
respectively.  Lopez vainly called out
for help.  "Roger Pogi" had
Lopez’ arms pinioned around his waist while Engracio and Delfin walked on both
sides of him.  Lopez struggled to
extricate himself but, in an instant, as soon as they stepped outside the door,
Delfin Bustos shot him on the chest at close range with a .22 caliber
revolver.  "Roger Pogi"
released his hold on the victim and allowed him to break away.  Running and stumbling toward the gate of the
compound, Lopez met his older brother Jesus who had just arrived with a
companion.  Jesus immediately hailed a
jeep to take his wounded brother to the Virgen <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">delos </span>Remedios Hospital.  On the way to the hospital, Cristorey was gasping for breath.  Blood was splattered all over his chest.  He was in a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">semi?</span>consious state.  Nevertheless, he indicated to Jesus the exact spot where he had been
shot and told Jesus that it was Delfin Bustos, his "rival," who shot
him and that it was "Gracing" who gave the gun to Delfin.  He expired at 9:00 o'clock that same night.</p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy report indicated that Lopez died of shock and
internal hemorrhage secondary to a gunshot wound at the sternum of the second
rib, fracture comminuted at the posterior left <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">side, </span>7th rib and laceration of the upper and lower lobes of the
left lung (p. 26, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">The incident was reported by Gonzalo Pineda to a traffic
policeman, Patrolman Diosdado Canlas, at the San Matias crossing.  Together with Patrolman Quiambao and
Sergeant Daniel Canlas, Patrolman Diosdado Canlas immediately repaired to the
scene of the crime to conduct an investigation.  They interviewed Estelita (Lita) Ramos Javenir, Teresita (Tessie)
Gumba Punsones, both taxi-dancers at the Pavilion Night Club in San Fernando,
Pampanga, Jesus Bacud Palma, and Rodolfo Ortoleza, occupants of various
apartments inside the Lopez compound.  They were brought to the municipal building where their written
statements were taken.  They told Patrolman
Canlas that they saw Delfin Bustos, Engracio Bustos, and "Roger Pogi"
come out of the taxi-dancers’ apartment and that Cristorey Lopez was shot by
Delfin Bustos.  They also showed the
policeman the exact spot where the killing occurred.  The girls also gave sworn statements before the Acting Chief of
Police.  However, they and Jesus Palma
could not be presented at the trial because they moved out of Sto. Tomas to
unknown addresses soon after the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Felicidad Miranda, rental collector of the Lopez compound,
testified that at around 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon of September 19, 1968,
she was in the Lopez compound to inspect the apartments and collect the rentals
from the tenants.   She saw Cristorey
inside the apartment of the taxi-dancer.  She knew that both taxi-dancers were girlfriends of Delfin and Engracio Bustos.  She had earlier advised Cristorey Lopez
"not to be so close to the girls."</p>

<p class="BODY">Delfin Bustos and his uncle Engracio Bustos admitted during the
trial that they were in Tessie's and Lita's apartment on September 18, 1968 at
six or seven in the evening.   They had
gone to the Lopez compound to look for Agustin Bustos, because they needed a
car to bring Delfin's sister, Pamela, to the Manila International Airport.  They went to Tessie's apartment to look for
Agustin.  They had a ten?minute
conversation with Tessie.  When they
stepped out of the apartment, they allegedly heard a shot.  They saw an injured man about seven (7)
meters away kneeling with head bowed, and being held by somebody whom they
failed to recognize.  The two men were
grappling with each other.  They wer
allegedly so terrified that they scaled the concrete wall of the compound and
fled toward the MacArthur Highway.</p>

<p class="BODY">Agustin Bustos testified that he had been invited to the birthday
party of a certain Lita in one of the apartments.  From where he sat at Lita's party, he saw Cristorey Lopez
drinking beer with some persons in Tessie's apartment.  A small boy informed him later that Delfin
and Engracio were looking for him, so he got out of Lita's apartment to talk to
them.  He heard a shot.  Most of the people scampered out of the
front gate, He, Delfin, and Engracio jumped over the fence and ran toward the
MacArthur Highway.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Delfin Bustos admitted on cross-examination, that on September
20, 1968, or two days <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">after</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>the shooting, his father Agustin advised
him "to hide in the meanwhile as he (Agustin) would try to fix the
case." So, he stopped working at the La Mallorca and hid in his aunt's
house in Pangasinan.  On October 2,
1968, his father and some PC soldiers arrived and took him to Camp Olivas.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 15, 1977, the lower court rendered judgment finding
Delfin Bustos guilty of murder but acquitting Engracio Bustos.  The case against Pablito Bungay, alias
"Roger Pogi" was archived pending his arrest.  The dispositive portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote><i>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused DELFIN BUSTOS guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER and imposes upon him the penalty</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>of RECLUSION PERPETUA, with the
accessory penalties incident thereto; to indemnify the </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">heirs </span>of the victim Cristorey Lopez,
the following:   P12,000.00, as indemnity
for the death of said Cristorey Lopez; P50,000.00, as indemnity for loss of
earning capacity of the deceased; P7,560.00, as actual damages representing
hospital, funeral and miscellaneous expenses; P10,000.00, as moral damages;
P1,000.00, </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>attorney's
fees, with costs of this suit (Heirs of Raymundo Castro vs. Bustos, No. L?25913,
February 28, 1969).  No subsidiary
imprisonment is imposed In case of insolvency due to the nature of the penalty
imposed (Article 39, R.P.C.).<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Accused ENGRACIO BUSTOS, alias "Gracing," is
hereby acquitted on ground of reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"The record of this case is hereby archived insofar as
Pablito Bungay alias Roger Pogi is concerned." (pp. 34-35, Rollo.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Delfin Bustos appealed to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues that:   (1)
it was improbable for him to have shot Lopez because his companion "Roger
Pogi" was directly behind the deceased; (2) that he could not have fired
the gun, as the trajectory of the bullet was downward on the 2nd rib through
the lower part of the 7th rib, and the deceased was admittedly taller than the
appellant; (3) that the declaration of the deceased to his brother inside the
jeep on the way to the hospital was not a dying declaration because:   (a) the alleged statement came from a biased
source; and (b) there was no evidence that Cristorey Lopez had abandoned hope
of living.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the records of the case and a careful consideration
of the arguments raised by the accused-appellant in his brief disclose no
reason why we should not accord the usual respect given to the factual finding
of the trial court that Delfin Bustos was the gunman who killed Cristorey
Lopez.  The shooting was witnessed by a
13-year old boy, Rodolfo Ortoleza.  That
the shot was fired at close range was substantiated by the presence of gun
powder burns at the point of entry some 5 cm. at the level of the victim's
second rib.  As the appellant fired the
gun at the side of the victim his co-accused "Roger Pogi" was in no
danger of being hit also.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ortoleza testified in a direct and candid manner, despite
rigorous cross-examination.  The minor
inconsistencies in some details of his testimony do not destroy his
credibility, but, on the contrary, are indicative of his truthfulness and of
the fact that he had not been coached or rehearsed.  His identification of the accused was clear and unequivocal.  Mere denials by the accused, who admitted
his presence at the scene of the crime, may not prevail against the categorical
declarations of the prosecution witnesses that it was he who shot Rey Lopez.</p>

<p class="BODY">The victim's dying declaration to his brother Jesus, that
"his rival Delfin Bustos" shot him deserves full credit for:   (1) it was made under the consciousness of
impending death; (2) the declaration referred to the cause of the declarant's
injury and impending death; and (3) the declarant was a competent witness
(People vs. Balbas, 122 SCRA 859; People vs. Sabio, 102 SCRA 219).  That the <u>ante mortem</u> declaration was
made by the victim under consciousness of impending death can hardly be doubted
for, as a matter of fact, he died some two hours later.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's flight and concealment of himself from the
authorities, as well as the attempts of his family to "settle" the
case with the Lopezes (p. 30, t.s.n., November 22, 1971) constitute an implied
admission of his guilt (People vs. Ornoza, 151 SCRA 495; Sec. 24, Rule 130,
Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery in the commission of the crime was sufficiently proven
by the unrebutted testimony of Ortoleza that "Roger Pogi," Engracio
Bustos and Delfin Bustos forcibly dragged the struggling victim out of Tessie's
apartment, that the victim was unarmed, and that, as soon as they were out of
the door, Delfin shot Lopez at close range, giving the victim no opportunity to
flee or defend himself (pp. 8-19, t.s.n., Aug. 12, 1969)</p>

<p class="BODY">Alevosia is present when the victim is defenseless and killed in
such a manner as to insure the execution of the crime, or make it impossible or
difficult for the victim to retaliate or at least defend himself (People vs.
Gil Jumadaiao, 143 SCRA 371; People vs. Leoncio Yusep, 151 SCRA 248).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of all the foregoing, We find no reversible error in the
trial court's finding that the appellant, Delfin Bustos, is guilty of murder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the modification that the death indemnity
payable by the appellant Delfin Bustos to the heirs of Cristorey Lopez is
increased to P30,000, the decision appealed from is affirmed, with costs
against the said appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
