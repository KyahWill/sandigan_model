- setting decision in <span class="SpellE"><u>Vir</u></span><u>-Jen</u> <u>Shipping</u>
<u>and</u> <u>Marine</u> <u>Services</u> <u>Inc.</u> <u>v.</u> <u>National</u> <u>Labor</u>
<u>Relations</u> <u>Commission,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al</u>. (125 SCRA 577
[1983]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On constitutional, statutory,
and factual grounds, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">we </span>find no
reason to disturb the doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><u>Vir</u></span><u>-Jen</u>
<u>Shipping</u> and to turn back the clock of progress for sea-based overseas
workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The experience gained in the
past few years shows that, following said doctrine, we should neither deny nor
diminish the enjoyment by Filipino seamen of the same rights and freedoms taken
for granted by other workingmen here and abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases at bar involve a group of Filipino seamen who were
declared by the defunct National Seamen Board (NSB) guilty of breaching their
employment contracts with the private respondent because they demanded, upon
the intervention and assistance of a third party, the International Transport
Worker's Federation (ITF), the payment of wages over and above their contracted
rates without the approval of the NSB.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners were ordered to reimburse the total amount of US
$91,348.44 or its equivalent in Philippine Currency representing the said
over-payments and to be suspended from the NSB registry for a period of three
years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC) affirmed the decision of the NSB.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a corollary development, the private respondent, for failure
of the petitioners to return the overpayments made to them upon demand by the
former, filed <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charges against some of the
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The criminal cases were
eventually consolidated in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of then
respondent Judge Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Benipayo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, these consolidated petitions, G.R. No.
64781-99 and G.R. Nos. 57999 and 58143-53, which respectively pray for the
nullification of the decisions of the NLRC and the NSB, and the dismissal of
the criminal cases against the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are found in the questioned decision of the NSB in G.R.
No. 64781-99.</p>

<blockquote>"From the records of this case it appears that the facts
established and/or admitted by the parties are the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that on different dates in 1977 and 1978
respondents entered into separate contracts of employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
"B" to "B-17", inclusive) with complainant (private
respondent) to work aboard vessels owned/operated/manned by the latter for a
period of 12 calendar months and with different rating/position, salary,
overtime pay and allowance, <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span>
specified:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>; that aforesaid employment contracts were verified
and approved by this Board; that on different dates in April 1978 respondents (petitioners)
joined the M/V ‘GRACE RIVER’; that on or about October 30, 1978 aforesaid
vessel, with the respondents on board, arrived at the port of Vancouver,
Canada; that at this port respondent received additional wages under rates
prescribed by the International Transport Worker's Federation (ITF) in the
total amount of US$98,261.70; that the respondents received the amounts
appearing opposite their names, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>xxx; that aforesaid amounts were over and above the rates of pay of
respondents </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">appearing in their employment contracts
approved by this Board; that on November 10, 1978, aforesaid vessel, with
respondent on board, left Vancouver, Canada for Yokohama, Japan; that on
December 14, 1978, while aforesaid vessel, was at <span class="SpellE">Yura</span>,
Japan, they were made to disembark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp.
64-66, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, according to the petitioners, while the vessel was
docked at Nagoya, Japan, a certain Atty. Oscar Torres of the NSB Legal
Department boarded the vessel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and </span>called
a meeting of the seamen including the petitioners, telling them that for their
own good and safety they should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">sign </span>an
agreement prepared by him on board the vessel and that if they do, the cases
filed against them with NSB on November 17, 1978 would be dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the petitioners signed the "Agreement"
dated <st1:date year="1978" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Annex C of Petition) However, when they were
later furnished <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies of what they had signed,
they noticed that the line "which amount(s) was/were received <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and </span>held by CREWMEMBERS in trust for
SHIPOWNERS" was inserted therein, thereby making it appear that the
amounts given to the petitioners representing the increase in their wages based
on ITF rates were only received by them in trust for the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the vessel reached <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the private respondent demanded from the petitioners the “overpayments” made to
them in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the petitioners refused to give back the
said amounts, charges were filed against some of them with the NSB and the
Professional Regulations Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> charges were also filed before different branches of
the then Court of First Instance of Manila which, as earlier stated, were
subsequently consolidated in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of the
respondent Judge Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Benipayo</span> and which
eventually led to G.R. Nos. 57999 and 58143-53.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. Nos. 64781-99, the petitioners claimed before the NSB
that contrary to the private respondent's allegations, they did not commit any
illegal act nor stage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">a </span>strike
while they were on board the vessel; that the "Special Agreement"
entered into in <st1:city><st1:place>Vancouver</st1:place></st1:city> to pay
their salary differentials is valid, having been executed after peaceful
negotiations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners further argued
that the amounts they received were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in</span> accordance with the provision of law,
citing among others, Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">18, Rule </span>VI,
Book I of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code which provides
that "the basic minimum salary of seamen shall not be less than the
prevailing minimum rates established by the International Labor Organization
(ILO) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or </span>those
prevailing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the country whose
flag the employing vessel carries, whichever is higher xxx"; and that the
"Agreement" executed in Nagoya, Japan had been forced upon them and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that intercalations were made </span>to make
it appear that they were merely trustees of the amounts they received <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">in </span>Vancouver.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the private respondent alleged that the
petitioners breached their employment contracts when they, acting in concert
and with the active participations of the ITF while the vessel was in
Vancouver, staged an illegal strike and by means of threats, coercion and
intimidation compelled the owners of the vessel to pay to them various sums <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> US$104,244.35; that the respondent entered into
the "Special Agreement" to pay the petitioners’ wage differentials
because it was under duress as the vessel would not be allowed to leave
Vancouver unless the said agreement was signed, and to prevent the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> from incurring further delay in the shipment of
goods; and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>view of
petitioners’ breach of contract, the latter's names must be removed from the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">NSB's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>Registry and that they should be
ordered to return the amounts they received over and above their contracted
rates.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent NSB ruled that the petitioners were guilty of
breach of contract because despite subsisting and valid NSB-approved employment
contracts, the petitioners sought the assistance of a third party (ITF) to
demand from the private respondent wages in accordance with the ITF rates,
which rates are over and above their rates of pay as appearing in their NSB-approved
contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As bases for this conclusion,
the NSB stated:</p>

<blockquote>"1) The fact that respondents sought the aid of a third party
(ITF) and demanded for wages and overtime pay based on ITF rates is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">shown in the entries </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">their respective Pay-Off Clearance Slips which were marked as their <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "1" to "18", and we quote
‘DEMANDED ITF WAGES, OVERTIME, DIFFERENTIALS APRIL TO OCTOBER 1978'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Suzara</span>
admitted that the entries in his Pay-Off Clearance Slip (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"1" <span class="GramE">are</span> correct (TSN., p. 16, Dec. 6, 1979).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is the policy (reiterated very
often) by the ITF that it does not interfere in the affairs of the crewmembers
and masters and/or owners of a vessel unless it</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">s </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">assistance is sought by
the crewmembers themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under this
pronounced policy of the ITF, it is reasonable to assume that the
representatives of the ITF in </span><st1:place><st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Vancouver</span></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, </span><st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Canada</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> assisted and intervened by reason of the
assistance sought by the latter.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">“2) The fact that the ITF
assisted and </span>intervened for and in behalf of the respondents in the
latter's demand for higher wages could be gleaned from the answer of the
respondents when they admitted that the ITF acted in their behalf in the
negotiations for increase of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Morover</span></span>,
respondent Cesar <span class="SpellE">Dimaandal</span> admitted that the ITF differential
pay was computed by the ITF representative (TSN. p. 7, <span class="SpellE">dec</span>.
12, 1979)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3) The fact that complainant and the owner/operator of the vessel
were compelled to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">sign </span>the
Special Agreement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. "</span>20")
and to pay ITF differentials to respondents in order not to delay the departure
of the vessel and to prevent further losses is shown in the ‘Agreement’ (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "R-21") xxx&gt;") pp. 69-70, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Rollo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">)</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NSB further said:</p>

<blockquote>"While the Board recognizes the rights of the respondents to
demand for higher wages, provided the means are peaceful and legal, it could
not, however, sanction the same if the means employed are violent and
illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the means
employed are violent and illegal for in <span class="GramE">demanding</span>
higher wages the respondents sought the aid of a third party and in turn the
latter intervened in their behalf and prohibited the vessel from sailing unless
the owner and/or operator of the vessel acceded to respondents' demand for
higher wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To avoid suffering further
incalculable losses, the owner and/or operator of the vessel had no alternative
but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to pay respondents’ wages in
accordance with the ITF scale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Board
condemns the act of a party who enters into a contract and with the use of
force/or intimidation causes the other party to modify said contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">If
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the respondents believe that
they have a valid ground to demand from the complainant a revision of the terms
of their contracts, the same should have been done in accordance with law and not
thru illegal means.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">at</span>
p. 72, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although the respondent NSB found that the petitioners were
entitled to the payment of earned wages and overtime pay/allowance from <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1978</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1978</st1:date>, it<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt"> </span>nevertheless ruled that the
computation should be based on the rates of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">pay </span>as appearing in the petitioners’ NSB-approved contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It ordered that the amounts to which the
petitioners are entitled under the said computation should be deducted from the
amounts that the petitioners must return to the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the NLRC affirmed the <span class="SpellE">NSB's</span>
findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the
petition in G.R. Nos. 64781-99.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 57999 and 58143-53 moved
to quash the criminal cases of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> filed against
them on the ground that the alleged crimes were committed, if at all, in
Vancouver, Canada and, therefore, Philippine courts have no jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge denied the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the second petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue in these consolidated petitions is whether or
not the petitioners are entitled to the amounts they received from the private
respondent representing additional wages as determined in the special
agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If they are, then the
decision of the NLRC and NSB must be reversed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, the criminal cases of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> must
be dismissed because it<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>follows
as a consequence that the amounts received by the petitioners belong to them
and not to the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at the questioned decision, the NSB ruled that the
petitioners are not entitled to the wage differentials as determined by the ITF
because the means employed by them in obtaining the same were violent and
illegal and because in demanding higher wages the petitioners sought the aid of
a third party, which, in turn, intervened in their behalf and prohibited the
vessel from sailing unless the owner and/or operator of the vessel acceded to
respondents' demand for higher wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And as proof of this conclusion, the NSB cited the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the entries in the petitioners Pay–Off
Clearance Slip which contained the phrase "DEMANDED ITF WAGES xxx";
(b) the alleged policy of the ITF in not interfering with crewmembers of a
vessel unless its intervention is sought by the crewmembers themselves; (c) the
petitioners' admission that ITF acted in their behalf; and (d) the fact that
the private respondent was compelled to sign the special agreement at
Vancouver, Canada.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the public and private respondents'
pleadings, to support the allegations that the petitioners used force and
violence to secure the special agreement signed in <st1:place><st1:city>Vancouver</st1:city>,
 <st1:state>British Columbia</st1:state></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">no </span>need for any form of intimidation coming from the Filipino
seamen because the Canadian Brotherhood of Railways and Transport Workers
(CBRT), a strong Canadian labor union, backed by an international labor
federation was actually doing all the influencing not only on the ship-owners
and employers but also against third world seamen themselves who, by receiving
lower wages and cheaper accommodations, were threatening the employment and
livelihood of seamen from developed nations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bases used by the respondent NSB to support its decision do
not prove that the petitioners initiated a conspiracy with the ITF <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>deliberately sought its assistance
in order to receive higher wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
only prove that when ITF acted in petitioners’ behalf for an increase in wages,
the latter manifested their support.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This would be a logical and natural reaction for any worker in whose
benefit the ITF or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">any </span>other
labor group had intervened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners admit that while they expressed their conformity to and their
sentiments for higher wages by means of placards, they, nevertheless, continued
working and going about their usual chores.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, all they did was to exercise their freedom of speech in
a most peaceful way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ITF people, in
turn, did not employ any violent means to force the private respondent to
accede to their demands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they
simply applied effective pressure when they intimated the possibility of
interdiction should the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> fail to heed the
call for an upward adjustment of the rates of the Filipino seamen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Interdiction is nothing more than a refusal
of ITF members to render service for the ship, such as to load or unload its
cargo, to provision it or to perform such other chores ordinarily incident to
the docking of the ship at a certain port.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">It </span>was the fear of ITF
interdiction, not any action taken <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span>the
seamen on board the vessel which led the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">shipowners</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>to yield.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">NSB's</span> conclusion that it is <span class="SpellE">ITF's</span> policy not to intervene with the plight of
crewmembers of a vessel unless its intervention was sought is without
basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court is cognizant of the
fact that during the period covered by the labor controversies <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Wallen</u></span>
<u>Philippines</u> <u>Shipping,</u> <u>Inc.</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Minister</u> <u>of</u>

(supra) and these consolidated petitions, the ITF was militant worldwide
especially in Canada, Australia, Scandinavia, and various European countries,
interdicting foreign vessels and demanding wage increases for third world
seamen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no need for Filipino
or other seamen to seek ITF intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The ITF was waiting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>its
own volition in all Canadian <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ports, </span>not
particularly for the petitioners’ vessel but for all ships similarly
situated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, the ITF was
not really acting for the petitioners out of pure altruism.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ITF was merely protecting the interests
of its own members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners
happened to be pawns in a higher and broader struggle between the ITF on one
hand and <span class="SpellE">shipowners</span> and third world seamen, on the
other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To subject our seamen to criminal
prosecution and punishment for having been caught in such a struggle is out of
the question.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Vir</u></span><u>-Jen</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

compared to accepted and valid modes of labor activity." (<span class="GramE">at</span> page 591)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Given these factual situations, therefore, we cannot affirm the

for their own benefit and the resulting <span class="SpellE">ITF's</span>

acts of the petitioners in demanding and receiving wages over and above the

<p class="BODY">It is impractical for the NSB to require the petitioners, caught
in the middle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>a labor
struggle between the ITF and owners of ocean going vessels halfway around the

to first secure the approval of the NSB in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
before signing an agreement which the employer was willing to sign.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also totally unrealistic to expect the

<p class="BODY">An examination of Annex C of the petition, the agreement signed
in Japan by the crewmembers of the M/V Grace River and a certain M. <span class="SpellE">Tabei</span>, representative of the Japanese <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>,
lends credence to the petitioners’ claim that the clause "which amount(s)
was received and held by CREWMEMBERS in trust for SHIPOWNER" was an
intercalation added after the execution of the agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The clause appears too closely typed below
the names of the 19 crewmen and their wages with no similar intervening space
as that which appears between <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">all </span>the
paragraphs and the triple space which appears between the list of crewmembers
and their wages on one hand and the paragraph above which introduces the list,
on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The verb "were"
was also inserted above the verb "was" to make the clause
grammatically correct but the insertion of "were" is already on the
same line as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"Antonio </span>Miranda
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and </span>5,221.06" where it

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the proposition that the petitioners should have
pretended to accept the increased wages while in Vancouver but returned them to
the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> when they reached its country, Japan,
has already been answered earlier by the Court:</p>

<blockquote>"Filipino seamen are admittedly as competent and reliable as
seamen from any other country in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, there would not be so many of them in the vessels sailing in
every ocean and sea on this globe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
competence and reliability, not cheap labor that makes our seamen so greatly in
demand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Filipino seamen have never
demanded the same high salaries as seamen from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

certainly they are entitled to government protection when they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">ask </span>for fair and decent treatment by
their employer and when they exercise the right to petition for improved terms
of employment, especially when they feel that these are sub-standard or are
capable of improvement according to internationally accepted rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the domestic scene, there are marginal
employers who prepare two sets of payrolls for their employees - one in keeping
with minimum wages and the other recording the sub-standard wages that the

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy to emphasize that while the International Labor
Organization (ILO) set the minimum basic wage of able seamen at US$187.00 as
early as October 1976, it was only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>1979
that the respondent NSB issued Memo Circular No. 45, enjoining all shipping
companies to adopt the said minimum basic wage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was correct for the respondent NSB to state in its decision that when
the petitioners entered into separate contracts between 1977-1978, the monthly
minimum basic wage for able seamen ordered by NSB was still fixed at
US$130,00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it is not the fault
of the petitioners that the NSB not only violated the Labor Code which created
it and the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code but also seeks to
punish the seamen for a shortcoming of NSB itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 21(c) of the Labor Code, when it created the NSB,
mandated the Board to "(O<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">btain</span></span>

<p class="BODY">It took three years for the NSB to implement requirements which,
under the law, they were obliged to follow and execute immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During those three years, the incident in <st1:city><st1:place>Vancouver</st1:place></st1:city>

<p class="BODY">Implicit in these petitions and the only reason for the NSB to

golden egg.’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, Filipino

relatively lower if not the lowest, international rates of compensation, should
not agitate for higher wages while their contracts of employment are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">subsisting, should accept as sacred, iron
clad, and immutable the side contracts which require them to falsely pretend to

the ship leaves that port, should stifle not only their right to ask for
improved terms of employment but their freedom of speech and expression, and
should suffer instant termination of employment at the slightest sign of
dissatisfaction with no protection from their Government and their courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the petitioners contend that
Filipinos would no longer be accepted as seamen, those employed would lose
their jobs, and the still unemployed would be left hopeless.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is not the first time and it will not be the last where
the threat of unemployment and loss of jobs would be used to argue against the
interests of labor; where efforts by workingmen to better their terms of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">employment would be characterized as
prejudicing the interests of labor as a whole."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
