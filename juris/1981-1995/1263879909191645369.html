Ap-16404, located in barrio <span class="SpellE">Minuyan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, with an area

occupation of said parcel of land under a <u style="">bona</u>

and uninterrupted possession and occupation thereof in the concept of owner for
a period of over sixty (60) years and having acquired ownership thereof by

<p class="BODY">Regarding petitioner's title over the said parcels of land, the

the decision of respondent Court of Appeals, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that parcel of land (Psu-225872) under LRC No. 146
consisting of 31,887 square meters was originally in open, peaceful, adverse,
exclusive and uninterrupted possession of <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> in the concept of owner since 1934 who cleared
the land, and planted thereon trees and upland rice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in October, 1943 he sold the same to his
nephew Pedro <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">I) who took immediate possession thereof and introduced additional
improvements thereon by building his house and planting <span class="SpellE">palay</span>

</span>That said Pedro <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> declared the land for
taxation purposes in 1967 and had paid the real estate taxes from 1962 to 1967
(Exhibit J-l); and caused the property to be surveyed preparatory to the filing
of an application for registration (Exhibit D).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That from October 1943 to January 1970, said original applicant Pedro <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> continued with the same kind of possession as his
predecessor-in-interest until January 1970 when <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
Republic Cement Corporation through its workers and employees forcibly entered
his property and dispossessed him thereof; and the same later became the
subject of a forcible entry case before the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>, but was dismissed on the ground of jurisdiction
since the question of ownership was put in issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1972</st1:date> said Pedro <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>

registration case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The oral testimony of
original applicant <span style="">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, insofar </span>as <span style="">concerns location, </span>character and continuity of possession, was

of them claiming to have known this parcel of land for more than 30 years, as

Psu-227659) under LRC No. 147 consisting of 38,290 and 30,099 square meters,
respectively, it appears that the same were originally in open, peaceful,
adverse, exclusive, continuous and uninterrupted possession by Fidel Enriquez
in the concept of owner since 1932, who introduced improvements thereon by
planting fruit-bearing trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That in
1943 said Fidel Enriquez donated the two parcels of land to his grandson Jose <span class="SpellE">Rayo</span> and his spouse Susana <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>

<p class="BODY">We defer to the above factual findings, there being no showing
that it was arrived at with grave abuse of discretion or without sufficient
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have carefully scrutinized and
reviewed the records and we find ample evidentiary support for the above
findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of petitioner that it has the right it claims over
Lot No. 2880 in its entirety, on the bases of the deeds of sale executed in its
favor and the surveyor's certificate, is untenable and cannot be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by respondent Court of Appeals, the land under
consideration, now known as Lot No. 2880, was previously owned by spouses Felix
and Maria <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the death of Felix <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>, one-half
(1/2) of said land was adjudicated and partitioned among his five (5)
daughters, namely, Francisca, <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, Susana, <span class="SpellE">Agatona</span> and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>, in a deed
of extrajudicial partition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the
shares of each of said heirs was transferred to herein petitioner by virtue of
deeds of absolute sale executed either by the heirs themselves or their
successors in interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on said transfers, petitioner is now seeking the
registration of the whole <span style="">of </span>Lot
No. 2880 in its name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This we cannot
allow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deeds of sale relied upon by
petitioner do not constitute sufficient legal justification for petitioner's
claim over all of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 2880.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's title over said lot, as the
successor in interest of said heirs, is limited only to whatever rights the
latter may have had therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
elementary that a grantor can convey no greater estate than what he has or in
which he has an alienable title or interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly and correctly observed by respondent court:</p>

<blockquote>"It might be that what Republic Cement had actually acquired
out of the one-half portion pertaining to Felix <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>
was more than 34,804 square meters (the totality of what had been adjudicated
to Francisca, <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, Susana, <span class="SpellE">Agatona</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>), because the said parcel of land was
still unregistered, their exact boundaries still undetermined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what it must have acquired out of Felix <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>â€™ one-half portion cannot be the whole of the
property that he owned in common with his wife Maria de la Cruz with a total
area of 207,996 square meters (20.7996 hectares), now known as Lot No. 2880,
Plan Ap-16404, title to which it seeks to register.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To uphold Republic Cement's claim to the
entire portion of Lot No. 2880 would be to include the portions pertaining to
Felix '<span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>' two sons Marcelo and Jose, as well
as the Portion pertaining to his wife Maria de la Cruz, which do not appear to
have been the subject of an extrajudicial settlement and/or sale."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's claim over the excess area is premised <span style="">on </span>the survey allegedly made by
private surveyor <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span>,
but the resultant areas depicted in said survey do not tally with, but
supposedly consist of expanded areas very much larger than, those indicated for
the lots involved in their respective tax declarations, viz:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tax Declaration No. 6831 of the spouses
Esmeraldo Reyes and Esperanza Bala<span class="SpellE">gtas</span>, successors in
interest of <span class="SpellE">Agatona</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>;
Tax Declaration No. 6829 of the spouses Francisco Reyes and Magdalena Joaquin,
successors in interest of Susana <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>; and Tax
Declaration No. 6830 of <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, Francisca and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangahas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts are expressly stated by the
foregoing parties in the deeds of sale they executed in favor of petitioner
over the lots covered by the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> tax
declarations.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
We do not find satisfactory the stilted explanation advanced to justify the
glaringly excessive disparity of areas resulting after the supposed survey.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it does not appear from our scrutiny of the records,
despite petitioner's representations in its written offer of evidence filed in
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, that the purported survey plans of the lots
involved were actually submitted in evidence therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was it alleged and proved that they
were approved by the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has long been held that unless a survey plan is duly approved by the
Director of Lands, the same is of dubious value and is not acceptable as
evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Indubitably, therefore, the reputed survey and its alleged results are not
entitled to credit and should be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">An applicant for registration of land, if he relies on a document
evidencing his title thereto, must prove not only the genuineness of said title
but also the identity of the land therein referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he only claims a portion of what is
included in his title, he must clearly prove that the property sought to be
registered is included in that title.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the appeal of private respondent Correa in
CA-G.R. CV No. 07088, respondent Court affirmed the order of the lower court
dismissing said private respondent's complaint for recovery of possession of
the parcels of land in question as being premature in view of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> before respondent court of the appeals subject of
CA-G.R. CV Nos. 07825 and 07826.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
this decision in the latter two cases, there is no need for us to pass upon the
case first mentioned.</p>
