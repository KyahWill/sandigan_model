the accused was charged with the crime of robbery with rape.  The complaint recounts that:</p>

her consent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The case was docketed as Criminal Case
No. 8759-MN and was raffled off to Branch 72 of the said court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial ensued after the accused entered a plea of not guilty.  The witnesses presented by the prosecution
were Dr. Louella T. Nario, Dolores Zinampan -- the offended party's mother and
the offended party herself.  Those
presented by the defense were Luis Andaya, Wilson Zamora, Rodel Cantos, Cecilia

the trial court found the accused guilty as charged.  The decretal portion thereof reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
finding the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with

and subject to the same rules and regulations governing prisoners serving
sentence by virtue of final judgment.  Otherwise, he shall only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">be </span>credited
with 4/5 thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence, upon which the judgment of conviction
is anchored, is condensed in the Appellee's Brief as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Complainant, Marlene Zinampan, is a twenty (20) year old
graduate of Medical Technology who works as Production (sic) Coordinator in
Interphase Electronics Corporation (TSN, January 10, 1990, p. 2; TSN, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">July 30, 1990, p. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">16).  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">On the other hand, appellant Reynaldo
Balajadia is a five foot seven (5'7") high school drop-out who works
allegedly as a jeepney driver (Record, p. 72).  Victim and appellant are strangers to each other although both lived
within Sto. Rosario Village, Bgy. Baritan, Malabon (TSN, July 23, 1990, p. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At about ten thirty (10:30) in the evening of December 16, 1989,
complainant, by means of public transportation, headed for home after attending
her office's Christmas party celebration.  By the time she reached the corner of Gov. Pascual and General Luna
Streets, Malabon, the place where she used to wait for tricycles to bring her
home, it was already 11:30 P.M.  As it
was already late, there were few tricycles that plied the streets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At any rate, desirous of reaching her home soonest, complainant
boarded a passing pedicab which was driven by a young man and in which a male
passenger (later identified as appellant) was already seated.  As appellant manifested that he would be the
first one to alight, complainant acquiesced to take the inner seat, between
appellant and where the pedicab driver was astride.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While passing through the dimly-lit street fronting Jose Rizal High
School, appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">swiftly </span>placed
his left arm around complainant's neck and, with an icepick thrust on her right
side, demanded from complainant to immediately hand over to him her
valuables.  Complainant, fearful for her
safety, acceded without any resistance by delivering to appellant her watch,
earrings and wallet containing two hundred (P200.00) pesos (TSN, February 28,
1990, pp. 23-24).  Entertaining lustful
desires upon complainant, appellant directed the pedicab driver to go straight
to the direction of Ginza Lodge.  The
pedicab driver objected to appellant’s plan as complainant was pleading for her
freedom but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the pedicab driver and
complainant's protestations were silenced when appellant wielded his icepick
against them.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon arrival at Ginza Lodge, appellant alighted and forcibly pulled
complainant out of the pedicab.  Wrapping his arm around her shoulder and holding her upper arm
presumably to show a normal behavior of any consenting couple checking in, but
squeezing hard said upper arm at the slightest resistance on the part of
complainant, appellant and complainant thus proceeded to the cashier for room
(sic) assignment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant brought complainant to the room assigned, locked the door
and placed a chair thereto.  Brandishing
the icepick, appellant then ordered complainant to remove her clothing.  Overcome by fear, complainant docilely obeyed
appellant's peremptory order and stripped herself of her intimate
garments.  After removing his own
clothing, appellant shoved complainant to the bed in the room.  Against her vigorous but futile
protestations and struggle, appellant succeeded in having carnal intercourse
with complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The despicable act swiftly consummated, appellant ordered his
weakened victim to put on her dress.  Either stricken with a pang of conscience, or assured that an
'insurance' or 'leverage' had served its purpose, or most probably being of no
material use to him, appellant returned to complainant the wristwatch, piece of
earring, and the wallet but minus the cash money of P200.00 in it which he had
earlier forcibly taken from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">latter
(TSN, January 10, 1990, p. 18).  Thereafter, in the same manner that he entered the motel, appellant
together with complainant checked out and boarded the waiting pedicab.  Before appellant alighted at Tonsuya St., he
sternly warned complainant never to report the incident to the police.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It was two o'clock in the morning of the following day (December
17, 1989), when complainant finally reached her home.  Immediately, she woke up her mother, Dolores Zinampan and related
the harrowing experience she had just undergone.  Seeing her daughter's skirt messed up with her own blood, she
instructed her daughter to clean and dress up.  Thereafter complainant, accompanied by her uncle and grandfather, went
to the Malabon Police Station to report the incident (Exhibit F, Record, p.
84).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon official request made by police investigator Daniel Cruz
(Exhibit C, Record, p. 14), NBI Medico Legal Officer Dr. Louella Nario on
December 18, 1989 or less than 48 hours after the commission of the crime,
conducted an examination of the body of complainant.  The physician found complete lacerations on her vagina, and the
hymen was ruptured at 1:00 o'clock and 7:00 o'clock, a circumstance highly
indicative of the probable fact that complainant was a virgin at the time of
the commission of the rape (TSN, February <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">14,
1990, p. 17).  The lacerations on the
hymen were likewise edematous and bled on slight manipulation.  After the examination, the physician issued
a medical certificate (Exhibit A, Record, p. 11).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On December 20, 1989, appellant was apprehended within the vicinity
of his residence (Exhibit D, Record, p. 15; TSN, January 10, 1990, p.
27)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Finding this summary to be fully supported by the transcri<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:23.0pt">p</span>ts of the stenographic notes of the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and the other records, we hereby adopt
the same as our own.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense presented a different version
which<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:23.0pt"> </span>the trial court summarized
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Accused Reynaldo Balajadia on the other hand, maintained that
he was already on board the pedicab on his way home when a woman, who turned
out to be the herein complainant, requested for a ride.  The woman took the inner seat and was
noticed by the accused to be well-dressed with make-up but somewhat
intoxicated.  As the complainant was
leaning on him, the accused asked her if she will go with him to a motel.  The complainant replied by asking what they
will be doing thereat, to which the accused replied that they will do <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">what a husband and a wife usually do.  The complainant did not say anything to
this, but her silence the accused interpreted as conformity to his
proposal.  The accused then told the
pedicab driver to go to the Ginza Motel which took them twenty (20) to thirty
(30) minutes to reach.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At the Ginza Motel, the pedicab stopped near the guardhouse and the
accused and the complainant went to the counter to pay and were guided to room
No. 45 at the second floor of the hotel.  Thereat, the complainant undressed first afterwhich the accused kissed
her, touched her breast and eventually put himself on top of her to have sexual
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">intercourse with the complainant.  After consumating (sic) the act, the accused
and the complainant dressed up and the accused told the complainant that he
will be bringing her home which the accused did, on the same pedicab that
brought them to the hotel.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused added that it was the complainant who told the driver
of the pedicab to wait for them and she even left her bag at the pedicab when
she returned thereto to tell the driver thereof to wait for them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Employees of the hotel corroborated the testimony of the accused
and they added that in the process of alighting from the pedicab and the
returning thereto by the complainant, in the making of the payment at the
counter and in the leading by roomboy (sic) of the complainant and the accused
to their assigned hotel room, they (hotel personnel) did not notice anything
unusual in the accused as well as in the complainant particularly the
latter.  The (sic) claimed that had they
noticed anything unusual, or involuntariness on the part of the complainant,
they would have refused admission of the couple to the hotel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused, however, admitted that he and the complainant were
total strangers not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">having met nor seen
each other before this incident."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected the defense's version thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The complainant is single, with a stable and promising
employment.  She has a boyfriend and was
in probable state of virginity.  She was
noticed by the Court to be a normal person not suffering from any visible mental
or vice related defect.  Under ordinary
and normal circumstances, the complainant would not have agreed to the proposal
of a total stranger that they go into a motel and thereat do the thing a
husband and a wife usually do, which was to have sexual intercourse with one
another.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the first opportunity, which was at 2:00 o'clock in the morning
of December 17, 1989, the complainant and her relatives were already at the
police headquarters to report that the complainant was raped at the Ginza
Hotel.  This is very much consistent
with what a true victim of rape will do under ordinary circumstances."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">At the bottom of these assigned errors lies the issue of the
credibility of witnesses.  The defense
suggests that because of its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">four </span>witnesses
-- all employees of the Ginza Hotel -- who testified on the actuations of the
complainant and the accused shortly<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>before
the alleged rape, it was clearly proven that the complainant willingly and
wilfully went with the accused and had sexual intercourse with him.  Settled of course is the rule that in the
determination of values and credibility of evidence, witnesses are to be
weighed, not numbered.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, the testimony of a single witness may be sufficient to produce a
conviction if the same appears to be trustworthy and reliable.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
If credible and convincing, that alone would be sufficient to convict the
accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Also firmly established is the doctrine that when the issue of the credibility
of witnesses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span>raised,
appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court
considering that the latter is in a better position to decide the question,
having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner
of testifying during the trial, unless certain facts of value have been plainly
overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Our own review of the evidence yields no compelling reason to
depart from the aforementioned rules.  On the contrary, we have found more reasons to accord full faith and
credence to the com<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p</span>lainant's
story.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is absolutely no evidence to show that the complainant,
then 20 years old, single, a virgin and a Medical Technology graduate working
as a Production Coordinator in the Interphase Electronics Corporation, is a
woman of loose morals, a sex pervert or a prostitute.  Nor is there any credible evidence to indicate that she was under
the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time she boarded the pedicab at around
10:30 o'clock in the evening of 16 December 1989.  We cannot therefore accept the fantastic tale woven by the
accused -- a high school drop-out and jeepney driver totally unknown to the
complainant -- that the complainant immediately welcomed his suggestion that
they proceed to a motel to do what a husband and wife would do; voluntarily
went with him to the motel; told the pedicab driver to wait for them; left her
bag with the said pedicab driver; followed the accused from the motel's
guardhouse, through the cashier's office, then up to Room 34 at the second
floor where she then sat on the bed; undressed ahead of the accused; and had
sexual intercourse with him after he kissed her, fondled her breasts and laid
on top of her.</p>

<p class="BODY">If indeed the complainant had voluntarily agreed to accept a
stranger's lewd suggestion that she savor the pleasures of illicit sex, she
would have then kept the experience, whether the same was one of excruciating
pain or indescribable ecstasy, completely to herself.  As borne out by the records, however, what the complainant
immediately did thereafter belies all suggestion that her participation in the
sexual act was voluntary and with her consent.  Upon reaching home at 2:00 o'clock in the early morning of 17 December
1989 with her skirt messed up by her own blood, the complainant woke her mother
up and related to her the harrowing ordeal that she had just undergone.  Then, after complying with her mother's
instruction to clean herself and dress up, the complainant, accompanied by her
uncle and grandfather, proceeded to the Malabon Police Station to report the
incident.  On 18 March 1989, pursuant to
an official request made by police investigator Daniel Cruz, the complainant
submitted to a medical examination conducted by NBI Medico-Legal Officer Dr.
Louella Nario.  The latter then
discovered complete lacerations in the complainant's vagina with the hymen
ruptured at 1:00 o'clock and 7:00 o'clock, a circumstance highly indicative of
the probable fact that the complainant was a virgin at the time she was raped.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 December 1989, the complainant signed the complaint for
robbery with rape which was then filed with the court <i>a quo</i> on 22
December 1989.  Thereafter, she
testified in court, described how the crime was committed -- publicly exposing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the process her defloration and the
dishonor suffered in the hands of the accused -- and underwent the ordeal of a
rigorous cross-examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant's behavior after the commission of the crime is
entirely consistent with the natural and logical reaction to the wrong
committed against her without her consent, and further enhanced and
strengthened the truthfulness of her story, demonstrated her courage to expose
the evil deeds of the accused and stressed her urgent cry for justice.  In this regard, it is <i>apropos</i> to
re-state the summary we made in <i>People vs. Tismo</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
of certain rules in rape cases:</p>

<blockquote>"However, equally settled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">is </span>the rule that when a woman says she has been raped, she says
in effect all that is necessary to show that rape has been committed and that
if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused may be convicted on
the basis thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The reason for this seems quite obvious, especially with respect to
the Filipina.  Considering a Filipina's
inbred modesty and antipathy in airing publicly things that affect her honor,
it is hard to conceive that she would assume and admit the ignominy she had
undergone if it were not true.  A
complainant would not risk ruining her future and exposing herself to ridicule
if her charge were not true.  If she
does undergo the expense, trouble and inconvenience of a public trial, suffer
the scandals, embarrassments and humiliation such action would indubitably
invite, as well as allow an examination of her private part, it is to bring to
justice the person who had abused her.  Indeed, if a complainant had voluntarily consented to have sex with the
accused, her most natural reaction would have been to conceal it and keep it as
this would bring disgrace to her honor and reputation as well as to her
family."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused wants this Court to give credence to the net effect of
the testimonies of the defense witnesses.  According to him, the complainant "did not offer any resistance nor
make any vocal protestation to prevent the accused from accomplishing his
alleged odious intention" and that "there was no immediate danger to
her [complainant's] person as the accused did not have any assault weapon in
his hand at the time they alighted from the pedicab as well as at the time the
accused was registering and paying in the presence of the cashier on duty,
CECILIA ZAMORA and the roomboy, RODEL CANTOS."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

We simply cannot accept these suggestions as it was established that the
accused armed himself with an icepick and actually threatened the complainant
with death.  The latter testified as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">At the police station in the early morning hours of 17 December
1989 where she reported the robbery with rape, the complainant spontaneously
revealed to the investigator that her assailant was armed with an icepick.  This fact was recorded in the police blotter
at "0310H" of 17 December 1989 (Exhibit "F").</p>

<p class="BODY">Against the complainant's positive testimony, nothing but a
self-serving denial was offered by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">We thus affirm the trial court's finding and conclusion that the
accused is guilty as charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court sentenced the accused to "life imprisonment
or <u>Reclusion</u> <u>Perpetua</u>." We have repeatedly declared that
life imprisonment is not the same as or synonymous with <i>reclusion perpetua.</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the proviso in the second paragraph of Article 294 of
the Revised Penal Code, the penalty for the crime of robbery with rape is <i>reclusion</i>
<i>perpetua</i> to death.  In view of
the first paragraph of Section 19, Article III of the 1987 Constitution
prohibiting the imposition of the death penalty, only <i>reclusion perpetua</i>
may be imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court failed to award the complainant moral
damages.  Under the circumstances in
this case, and conformably with recent case law, the latter should be awarded
moral damages in the sum of P40,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered AFFIRMING the
challenged decision of Branch 72 of the Regional Trial Court of Malabon, Metro
Manila in Criminal Case No. 8759-MN, subject to the modifications above
indicated.  As modified, the words
"life imprisonment" in the dispositive portion thereof are deleted
and the accused is hereby ordered to pay the complainant, Marlene Zinampan y de
Jesus, the sum of Forty Thousand Pesos (P40,000.00) as moral damages.</p>

complainant is a nymphomaniac, a promiscuous woman, or a prostitute" and
the presumption - that no young Filipina of decent repute would publicly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">admit that </span>she has been criminally
abused and ravished unless it is the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">truth
- totally </span>ignoring the concrete evidence on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

record, do not jibe with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her </span>protestation
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">lack </span>of consent to their
sexual congress.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Upon </span>alighting from the pedicab,
instead o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">f </span>telling the pedicab
driver to call the police, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">she </span>instructed
the pedicab driver to wait <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">for </span>them:</p>

<blockquote>Q - While you were alighting from the
tricycle according to you, you told the tricycle driver not to leave no matter
what happened.  That is contained in
your sworn statement Exhibit B?</blockquote>

appearing on page 2 of your sworn statement marked as Exhibit B in answer to
question No. 9 which  reads:  Q - Ano pa ang pangyayari?" you
answered:   "A - Nang kami ay

namin.  Kasi sinabihan ko itong tricycle
boy na huwag kaming iwan ano mang mangyari."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

tell the tricycle boy not to leave the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">hotel
</span>premises and wait <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>No, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(TSN, Feb. 28, 1990, pp. 49-50)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the moment that she and accused­-appellant alighted from the
pedicab, she had many occasions and opportunities to raise an outcry <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">help.  </span>She did nothing of
the sort but instead she freely followed accused-appellant in registering <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at </span>the cashier's counter and entering
Room 34 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the lodge.  They alighted from the pedicab near the
guard house towards which she could have immediately run as there were persons
there, among whom were Luis Andaya, the cashier of Ginza Lodge, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>Wilson Zamora, bellboy, but she
did not.  When the roomboy, Rodel
Cantos, met them, she could have told him that she was being forced to go with
accused.  Again she did not.  When they were registering at the cashier's
desk, she could have told Cecila Zamora, the cashier on duty at that time, that
she (complainant) was being brought to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
</span>lodge against her will.  Again
she did not.  I<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">t </span>is to be emphasized that at the time they were registering, by
her own testimony, complainant was standing behind accused-appellant -</p>

<blockquote>A  -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The roomboy was behind me while
I was behind the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(TSN

11.0pt">any </span>icepick <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with </span>which,
she had previously alleged he had threatened her -</p>

<blockquote>Q - While the accused was paying the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">receptionist with </span>his right hand was he
still holding the icepick with his right hand <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">also?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A  - No, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - In other words, when he was making
payments he was already no longer holding the icepick which he was keeping at
that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  - No, Sir</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - That was still the situation until
you reached the room assigned to you?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A  - Yes, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(TSN, Feb. 28, 1990, p. 48)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - But when you were in front of the
cashier his right hand was empty?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  - Yes, Sir. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - And still it did not occur to you to
seek help from the cashier and the roomboy who were both present at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  - Yes, Sir.  I was not able to do
anything.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - It was the roomboy who guided you to
the second floor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  - No, Sir.  He left after he said
the room number and so, we two only who went up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - He did not even try to point to you
or the accused where the room is located?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  - No, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">(
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">TSN, July 30, 1990, pp. 17-18 )<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Yet,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> during all this </span>time
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and all </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">way up </span>to Room 34 she did not ask for
help <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">or raise </span>an outcry.  This but shows that she went with
accused-appellant knowingly, voluntarily, and willingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, I find it absurd that a would-be rapist would parade
himself <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>his would-be victim
in front of several persons who could be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">potential
</span>witnesses against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">him.  Four (4) lodge employees, </span>Cecilia
Zamora, Luis Andaya, Wilson Zamora, and Rodel Cantos, who were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>the best <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">position to </span>observe the behavior and demeanor of complainant and
accused-appellant, categorically testified that they did not notice anything
unusual in the behavior of complainant and accused-appellant.  These lodge employees are impartial
witnesses, not related in any manner to accused-appellant.  True, they may be working in an
establishment of low repute, but this does not mean that they will countenance
the commission of a crime.  There is not
a shred of evidence on record that they are suborned witnesses.  Their testimony must thus be given full
credit.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am thus of the opinion that - complainant freely and
voluntarily consented to have sexual intercourse with accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">I, </span>therefore,
DISSENT from the majority opinion and Vote for the acquittal of
accused-appellant.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
