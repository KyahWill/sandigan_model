				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case may well serve <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as
a </span>textbook example of how <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">judicial
</span>processes, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">designed to </span>promote
the swift and efficient disposition of disputes at law, can be so grossly
abused and manipulated as to produce precisely the opposite result; how they
can be utilized by parties with small scruples to forestall for an
unconscionably long time so essentially simple a matter as making the security
given for a just debt answer for its payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the present proceedings and of two other cases
already decided by this Court expose how indeed the routine procedure of an
extrajudicial foreclosure came -- by dint of brazen forum shopping and other
devious maneuvering -- to grow into a veritable thicket of litigation from
which the mortgagee has been trying to extricate itself for the last twenty
years.</p>

<p class="BODY">Back in November 1964, <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Lim, for
and in his own behalf and as attorney-in-fact of his mother, the widow Maria
Moreno (now deceased) and of his brother Lorenzo, together with his other
brothers, <span class="SpellE">Aramis</span>, Mario and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>,
and his sister, <span class="SpellE">Nila</span>, all hereinafter collectively
called the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>, borrowed from petitioner Santiago <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>, Inc. (hereinafter, <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>
only) the sum of P800,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The loan
was given on the security of a first mortgage on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">property </span>registered in the names of said borrowers as owners in
common under Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 75413 and 75415 of the
Registry of Deeds of Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter
additional loans on the same security were obtained by the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>
from <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>, so that as of May 8, 1967, the aggregate
of the loans stood at P2,460,000.00, exclusive of interest, and the security
had been augmented by bringing into the mortgage other property, also
registered as owned <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pro</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span>

Registry.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute about these facts, nor about the additional
circumstance that as stipulated in the mortgage deed the obligation matured on
November 8, 1967; that the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

to pay it despite d<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">emands </span><span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>
consequently caused extra-judicial proceedings for the foreclosure of the
mortgage to be commenced by the Sheriff of Manila; and that the latter
scheduled the auction sale of the mortgaged property on December 27, 1968.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

names, but in the name of a partnership of which they themselves were the only
partners:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Heirs of Hugo Lim."
The complaint advocated the theory that the mortgage which they, together with
their mother, had individually constituted (and thereafter amended during the
period from 1964 to 1967) over lands standing in their names in the Property
Registry as owners <u>pro <span class="SpellE">indiviso</span></u>, in fact no
longer belonged to them at that time, having been earlier deeded over by them
to the partnership, "Heirs of Hugo Lim," more precisely, on March 30,
1959, hence, said mortgage was void because executed by them without authority
from the partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was signed by a lawyer other than Atty. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>, but the records disclose that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span> took over as counsel as of <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The case, docketed as Civil Case No. Q-39295, was assigned to Branch 35
of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Regional Trial Court, then
presided over by Judge Jose P. Castro.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Castro issued a restraining order on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, Sheriff Perfecto G. <span class="SpellE">Dalangin</span>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1984</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> filed in said Civil Case No. Q-36485 a motion
for reconsideration of the decision and for dismissal of the action, alleging
that it had never been served with summons; that granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that service had somehow been made, it had never received notice of the
decision and therefore the same had not and could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the ground of bar by prior judgment premised on the final decisions of the Supreme
Court in G.R. No. L-45752 and G.R. No. 56014.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two other motions by <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> quickly
followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first, dated <st1:date year="1984" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1984</st1:date>, prayed for abatement

The second, filed on July 24, 1984, was a supplement to the motion to dismiss
earlier filed, asserting another ground for the dismissal of the action, i.e.,
failure to state a cause of action, it appearing that the mortgaged property
remained registered in the names of the individual members of the Lim family
notwithstanding that the property had supposedly been conveyed to the plaintiff
partnership long before the execution of the mortgage and its amendments, and
that even assuming ownership of the property by the partnership, the mortgage
executed by all the partners was valid and binding under Articles 1811 and 1819
of the Civil Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is time to write <u>finis</u> to this unedifying narrative

marked the private respondents' thus far successful attempts to avoid the
payment of a just obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record
of the present proceeding and the other records already referred to, which the
Court has examined at length, make it<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>clear
that the dispute should have been laid to rest more than eleven years ago, with
entry of judgment of this Court (on September 24, 1977) in G. R. No. L-45752
sealing the fate of the Lim’s appeal against the amended decision in Civil Case
No. 75180 where they had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">originally </span>questioned
the validity of the mortgage and its foreclosure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That result, the records also show, had
itself been nine (9) years in coming, Civil Case No. 75180 having been
instituted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>December 1968 and,
after <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">trial </span>and judgment, gone
through the Court of Appeals (in CA-G. R. No. 00242-R) and this Court (in G.R.

<p class="BODY">Unwilling, however, to concede defeat, the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>
moved (in Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">C</span>ase No. 75180)
to stop the foreclosure sale on the ground of lack of republication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On December 19, 1977 they obtained a
restraining order in said case, but this notwithstanding, on the very same date
they filed another action (Civil Case No. 117262) in a different branch of the
same Court of First Instance of Manila to enjoin the foreclosure sale on the
same ground of alleged lack of republication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At about this time, <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> republished the
notice of sale in order, as it was later to manifest, to end all further
dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">That move met with no success.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> managed to persuade the judge in
Civil Case No. 75180, notwithstanding his conviction that the amended decision
in said case had already become final, not only to halt the foreclosure sale
but also to authorize said respondents to dispose of the mortgaged property at
a private sale upon posting a bond of P6,000,000.00 (later increased by
P3,000,000.00) to guarantee payment of <span class="SpellE">Syjuco's</span>
mortgage credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This gave the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> a convenient excuse for further suspension of the
foreclosure sale by introducing a new wrinkle into their contentions -- that
the bond superseded the mortgage which should, they claimed, therefore be
discharged instead of foreclosed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus from the final months of 1977 until the end of 1980, a
period of three years, <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> found itself fighting a
legal battle on two fronts:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the already finally decided Civil
Case No. 75180 and in Civil Case No. 117262, upon the single issue of alleged
lack of republication, an issue already mooted by the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>'
earlier waiver of republication as a condition for the issuance of the original
restraining order of December 26, 1968 in Civil Case No. 75180, not to mention
the fact that said petitioner had also tried to put an end to it by actually republishing
the notice of sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the advent of 1981, its pleas for early resolution having
apparently fallen on deaf ears, <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> went to this
Court (in G. R. No. L-56014) from which, on <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1982</st1:date>, it obtained the decision already referred
to holding, in fine, that there existed no further impediment to the
foreclosure sale and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>the
Sheriff could proceed with the same.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Said decision, instead of deterring further attempts to derail
the foreclosure, apparently gave the signal for the clandestine filing -- this
time by the Partnership of the Heirs of Hugo Lim -- on <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1982</st1:date> of Civil Case No. Q-36485, the
subject of the present petition, which <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for
the </span>first time</u> asserted the claim that the mortgaged property had
been contributed to the plaintiff partnership long before the execution of the <span class="SpellE">Syjuco's</span> mortgage in order to defeat the foreclosure.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> now maintains that it had no
actual knowledge of the existence and <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
Civil Case No. Q-36485 until confronted, in the manner already adverted to,
with the <u>fait</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accompli</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">’ </span>of a "final" judgment with
permanent injunction therein, and nothing in the record disabuses the Court
about the truth of this disclaimer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, considering what had transpired up to that <u>denouement</u>, it
becomes quite evident that actuations of the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> and
their lawyer had been geared to keeping <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> in the
dark about said case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their filing of
two other cases also seeking to enjoin the foreclosure sale (Civil Case No.
83-19018, Regional Trial Court of Manila in July 1983, and Civil Case No.
Q-32924, Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City in
September of the same year) <u>after said sale had already been permanently
enjoined by default judgment in Civil Case No. Q-36485</u>, appears in
retrospect to be nothing but a brace of feints calculated to keep <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> in that state of ignorance and to lull any
apprehensions it may have harbored about encountering further surprises from
any other quarter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further credence is lent to this appraisal by the unusually rapid
movement of Civil Case No. Q-36485 itself in its earlier stages, which saw the
motion to declare <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> in default filed, an order
of default issued, evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
for the plaintiffs received and judgment by default rendered, <u>all the brief
span of twelve days</u>, February 10-22, 1983. Notice of said judgment was
"served" on February 23, 1983, the day after it was handed down, only
to be followed by an unaccountable lull of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">well </span>over a year before it was ordered executed on July 9, 1984
-- unaccountable, considering that previous flurry of activity, except in the
context of a plan to rush the case to judgment and then divert <span class="SpellE">Syjuco's</span> attention to the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>'
moves in other directions so as to prevent discovery <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of the </span>existence of the case until it was too late.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">but </span>condemn
in the strongest terms this trifling with the judicial process which degrades
the administration of justice, mocks, subverts and misuses that process for
purely dilatory purposes, thus tending to bring it into disrepute, and seriously
erodes public confidence in the will and competence of the courts to dispense
swift justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts, the only defense to the foreclosure that could
possibly have merited the full-blown trial and appeal proceedings it actually
went through <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">was </span>that of alleged
usury pleaded in Civil Case No. 75180 and finally decided against the
respondent <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> in G.R. No. L-45752 in September
1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other issues of failure to
republish and discharge of mortgage by guarantee set up in succeeding actions
were sham issues, questions without substance only raised for purposes of delay
by the private respondents, in which th<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">e</span>y
succeeded only too well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claim urged
in this latest case:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the mortgaged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">property had </span>been contributed to the
respondent partnership and was already property of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<span class="SpellE">unauthorizedly</span> mortgaged it to <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">Syjuco</span></span>,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt"> </span>is of no better stripe, and this, too, is clear from the
undisputed facts and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">legal </span>conclusions
to be drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>respondent
partnership <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>composed <u>exclusively</u>
of the individual <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> in whose name all the cases
herein referred to, with the sole exception of Civil Case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">No. </span>Q-36485, were brought and
prosecuted, their contribution to the partnership consisting chiefly, if not
solely, of the property subject of the <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>
mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also a fact that despite
its having been contributed to the partnership, allegedly on <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1959</st1:date>, the property was
never registered with the Register of Deeds in the name of the partnership, but
to this date remains registered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the

mortgage deed of <st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1964</st1:date>
was executed by the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> as such owners, as were all
subsequent amendments of the mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no dispute that in those circumstances, the respondent
partnership was chargeable with knowledge of the mortgage from the moment of
its execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The legal fiction of a
separate juridical personality and existence will not shield it from the
conclusion of having such knowledge which naturally and irresistibly flows from
the <span class="SpellE">undenied</span> facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It would violate all precepts of reason, ordinary experience and common
sense to propose that a partnership, as such, cannot be held accountable with
knowledge of matters commonly known to all the partners or of acts in which all
of the latter, without exception, have taken part, where such matters or acts
affect property claimed as its own by said partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, therefore, the respondent partnership was inescapably chargeable
with knowledge of the mortgage executed by all the partners thereof, its
silence and failure to impugn said mortgage within a reasonable time, let alone
a space of more than seventeen years, brought into play the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to preclude any attempt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>avoid the mortgage as allegedly unauthorized.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principles of equitable <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>,
sometimes called <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pais</u></span>, are made part of our law by Art. 1432 of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Coming under this class is <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by silence, which obtains here and as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>which it has been held that:</p>

<blockquote>"* * * an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> may arise from
silence as well as from words.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘<span class="SpellE">Estoppel</span> by silence’ arises where a person, who by force of
circumstances is under a duty to another to speak, refrains from doing so and
thereby leads the other to believe in the existence of a state of facts in
reliance on which he acts to his prejudice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Silence may support an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> whether the
failure to speak is intentional or negligent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Inaction or silence may under some circumstances amount to a
misrepresentation and concealment of the facts, so as to raise an equitable <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
silence is of such a character and under circumstances that it would become a
fraud on the other party to permit the party who has kept silent to deny what

that partnership which was the real party in interest in all the actions; it
was actually represented in said actions by all the individual members thereof,

deemed to be simply the individual acts of said members, but in fact and in
law, those of the partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">What was done by the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> -- or by the

from several circumstances, namely that the mortgage was constituted over

principal obligation thereby secured was usurious; that the publication of the
notice of foreclosure sale was fatally defective, circumstances which had
already taken place at the time of the institution of the actions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They instituted four (4) actions for the same
