struggled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She kicked the man on <span style="">his </span>organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man was thrown near the door of the house

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant, in denying the unlawful act imputed to
him, claimed as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that he could
not have possibly committed the alleged rape against the offended party since
at the time of the incident he was in the high seas near <span class="SpellE">Balisin</span>
Island fishing together with a certain Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Menle</span>
and the latter’s son; that<span style=""> </span>they
left <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> at
around midnight of June 20, 1987 and it took them about 2 1/2 hours to reach
the place where they fished; and that they returned back to Villa Gomez, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> at about 9:00 o’clock in the morning of the
following day, June 21, 1987.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 3-4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 39-40)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon </span>arraignment,
the accused-appellant, assisted <span style="">by </span>his
counsel from the then Citizens’ Legal Assistance <span class="GramE">Office,</span>
entered a plea of not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial ensued and the verdict of conviction was rendered,
the instant appeal was interposed with a lone assignment of error, <u>to</u> <u>wit</u>:</p>

<blockquote>“THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE EVIDENCE OF THE
PROSECUTION HAS FAILED TO MEET THE TEST OF MORAL CERTAINTY OF APPELLANT’S GUILT
AND TO OVERCOME THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE IN HIS FAVOR.”
(Appellant’s Brief, p. 1; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="">p. 37)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant submits that the trial court assailed his
testimony instead of scrutinizing with utmost care the story told by the
alleged rape victim as required in cases of this nature thereby basing its<span style=""> conviction not on the strength of the evidence
for the prosecution but rather on the weakness of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The accused-appellant points out that
the alleged victim’s account of the imputed crime furnished few details by
which her story can be tested and that her story <span style="">was </span>tainted with improbabilities which rendered it highly
doubtful.</p>

<p class="BODY">The improbabilities referred to by the accused-appellant are as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that private complainant
Rosalie felt pain only after the accused-appellant had <span style="">forcibly inserted his penis to her vagina and was already on top of her
and making the coital movements when logic dictates that she should have been
awakened when the accused-appellant initially laid on top of her and made his
entry into her private part; and (2) that the said complainant was able to free
herself from the accused-appellant by kicking his private part when it is
inconceivable how a twelve-year old girl managed to do so with the size and
weight of the accused-appellant on top of her and making the push-and-pull
movement as claimed by the alleged victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 5-6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 41-42)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the contentions of the accused-appellant devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an axiomatic rule of law that “credibility” is the province
of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Januario</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz y <span class="SpellE">Hurado</span>, G.R. No. 84714, October 5, 1990 citing People v. <span class="SpellE">Caringal</span>, 176 SCRA 404 [1989]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Premised on the fact that the crime of rape,
more often than not, is witnessed only by the offended party and<span style=""> the accused, the trial judge’s evaluation of
the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before him deserves our utmost
respect in the absence of any </span>showing that such evaluation is tainted
with arbitrariness considering the trial judge’s advantage of directly
examining the witnesses’ demeanor in court.<span style="">&nbsp;

People v. <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>, etc., 148 SCRA 178 [1987])</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful perusal of the records of the case at bar discloses that
the trial court’s finding that the accused-appellant’s guilt is beyond any
indicia of doubt merits our unqualified concurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim’s straightforward and spontaneous
testimony clearly establishes the fact of rape and its author, the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stated in Court that:</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical findings made by the municipal physician who

the victim’s father and sister-in-law strongly </span><span style="">confirm </span><span style="">the fact that the
accused-appellant sexually abused Rosalie.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The improbabilities and lapses pointed out by the
accused-appellant in Rosalie’s narration of what the former did to her on that
fateful day in June 1987 are, indeed, more apparent than real as the
prosecution opined <span style="">because of a clear
showing that all the </span><span style="">essential </span><span style="">elements of the crime of rape under Article
335 of the Revised Penal Code are present.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused-appellant would like to make </span><span style="">us </span><span style="">believe that the
veracity of the victim’s narration is questionable since </span><span style="">she was </span><span style="">not awakened by the accused-appellant’s act of getting on top of her
and making the initial thrust of his penis into her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not at all unusual that the 12 -year
old girl would wake up only when the pain of the man’s organ being forced
inside her vagina was felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>man
did not have to bear down with his entire weight upon the poor victim before
trying to do the sexual act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
regard, our pronouncement in the case of <u>People</u> <u><span style="">v.</span></u><span style=""> <u>Romeo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Camasis</u></span>, G.R. No. 87083,

stated that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the sister-in-law arrived in the house, Rosalie was </span>unconscious on the

doubt as to who boxed and strangled Rosalie after raping her.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the accused-appellant’s defense of alibi must fail since
alibi is unavailing as a defense where there is positive identification of the
perpetrator of the crime, most especially, when the said identification is made
by the victim of the rape herself in the absence of any motive to implicate the
assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> Bravo, G.R. No. 68422, December 29, 1989 citing
