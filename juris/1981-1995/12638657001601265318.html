he heard the victim shout twice "Nay, <span class="SpellE">sinaksak</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>." He proceeded to the

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of the appeal is centered on credibility of the
witnesses for the prosecution, appellant faulting them as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span>
allegedly neither helped the victim nor could he have identified the
perpetrators since he was in a state of shock; that because the place was
crowded it was impossible to identify appellant as one of the perpetrators;
that <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span> was a neighbor of the victim; and that <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span>, instead of using the fastest means of
transportation, used a pushcart to bring the patient to the hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Limpin</span>
supposedly contradicted <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span> because the latter
never testified that shouts of "<span class="SpellE">magnanakaw</span>"
were heard; that he could not have inquired from appellant on what was
happening since <span class="SpellE">Limpin</span> was not a person in authority
or an agent thereof; and that <span class="SpellE">Limpin</span> was implicated
in another stabbing incident thereby casting doubt on his credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>,
appellant claims, was likewise inconsistent in his testimony that he
investigated the appellant in the morning and also in the afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalese's</span> testimony was
allegedly inconsistent with that of <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalese</span> stated that he heard his brother cry "Nay, <span class="SpellE">sinaksak</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>"
twice, while <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span> testified that he heard the
victim cry the same words once.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant further argues that <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> could not
have possibly heard his brother since his house was thirty meters away from the
corner of <st1:street><st1:address>Padre <span class="SpellE">Rada</span> St</st1:address></st1:street>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is an elementary rule that inconsistencies and contradictions
referring to minor details do not destroy the credibility of witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Inconsistencies in the principal eyewitness' testimony which are details that
do not impair the identification of the accused are not fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Witnesses who are in a state of surprise and
fright cannot be expected to recall with accuracy or uniformity matters
connected with the main overt act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather than discredit the testimony of the witnesses, such discrepancies
or minor details serve to add credence and veracity to their categorical,
straightforward and spontaneous testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From an analysis of the testimony of the witnesses for the
prosecution, it becomes readily apparent that the supposed errors involve minor
matters which have no material bearing on the commission of the criminal act
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Variances can be attributed to
the fact that different persons have diverse impressions and perceptions of a
startling event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
testimonies of two or more witnesses would be under a serious cloud of doubt if
their declarations tallied in their minutest details, for then, that would not
be natural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That would indicate that the
testimonies were rehearsed.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the trial court categorically observed that "(t<span class="GramE">)he</span> testimony of subject witness is clear, direct,
spontaneous and therefore deserves credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The witnesses testified in a straightforward manner, sincere and candid
in answering questions propounded during the direct examination as well as in
the cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have no
motive to testify falsely against the accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find no reason to depart from the cardinal
principle that the findings of the trial court on the matter of credibility
should not be disturbed on appeal due to its superior advantage in observing
the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses while testifying, unless some facts
or circumstances may have been overlooked that may affect the result of the
case.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The findings of the trial court carry great weight because they have the
privilege of examining the deportment and demeanor of witnesses, and, therefore,
can discern if such witnesses are telling the truth or not.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, we are convinced beyond reasonable doubt, on the
basis alone of the testimony of eyewitness Rolando <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span>,
that both accused actually committed the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Caladiao's</span> lone but
credible testimony is, to our mind, sufficient to support a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, even in the absence of corroborating
testimony, the accused can validly be convicted on the basis of the positive
identification by <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant tries to impeach <span class="SpellE">Limpin</span> by
adverting to the latter's being one of the respondents in a case for frustrated
murder in I.S. No. 85-13602 of the Office of the City Fiscal of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted, however, that in order to
affect the credibility of a witness by the mere fact that he was charged with
an offense, previous conviction by final judgment is required,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and the existence of <span class="GramE">a pending</span> information may not be
shown to impeach the witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
With more reason, therefore, should <span class="SpellE">Limpin</span> not be
discredited merely on the basis of a complaint filed with the city fiscal,
there being no showing that <span class="GramE">an information</span> has been
filed in court and that judgment has been rendered convicting him of the
offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of appellant hinges primarily on alibi which, as we
have repeatedly declared, is one of the weakest defenses that may be invoked by
an accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule once again that for
this defense to prosper, it is not enough to prove that the accused was
somewhere when the crime was committed but that he must also demonstrate that
it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot prevail over the
positive identification of the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an issue of fact that hinges on the
credibility of the witnesses who seek to establish it.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It has been held that no physical impossibility exists where the distance
between the scene of the crime and the place where the accused allegedly was at
that time would take only fifteen to twenty minutes to negotiate by jeep,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
or where it can be traversed by walking in one and a half hours,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
or where the places involved are only two hundred meters apart.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That it could not have been physically impossible for accused <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> to be at the scene of the crime is evident from his
own testimony to the effect that it would take him ten minutes if he rides a
jeep to reach Padre <span class="SpellE">Rada</span>, Manila, from <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>; that it would take him the same number of minutes
if he takes a taxi; and that if he walks from Padre <span class="SpellE">Rada</span>,
it would take him half an hour to reach <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alibi, we have consistently held, cannot prevail over the
positive identification of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if, admittedly, the eyewitness had seen the malefactors for the
first time at the time of the killing, it does not necessarily follow that he
could not have recognized their faces.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Persons observing a startling occurrence would strive to know the ones
involved, especially in a case where the victim is known to the eyewitness.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Perforce, there is no merit in the allegation of appellant that he could not
have been identified by <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span> who, at that time,
was supposedly in a state of shock.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no reason to doubt the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Caladiao</span>
who has positively identified the perpetrators of the crime, it appearing that
the place of the incident was well lighted and the witness was at a distance of
about three arm's length.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts
are sufficient to exclude any doubt in the identification of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the witness actually saw
appellant stab the victim on the chest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the victim sustained a stab wound on the chest was confirmed by the
medico-legal officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> <span class="SpellE">Cenido</span>,
who conducted an autopsy on the body of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also shown that this single stab wound
was fatal, thereby causing the immediate death of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proven circumstances attendant to the crime indubitably
establish that accused <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span>
conspired to commit the crime as shown by their coordinated acts directed to
ensure the accomplishment of their evil designs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The act of one accused in holding the victim
from behind when the latter was stabbed by his co-accused is a positive act
towards the realization of a common criminal intent, although the intent can be
classified as instantaneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be
safely assumed that had not the first accused held both arms of the victim from
behind, the latter could have parried the thrust or even run away from his
assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By immobilizing the two hands
of the victim from behind, and although there was no anterior conspiracy, the
two accused showed unity of criminal purpose and intent immediately before the
actual stabbing.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>
