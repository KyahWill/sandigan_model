importations, took effect on <st1:date month="12" day="21" year="1982">December
 21, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The importations
were effected in 1978 and 1979 by NIA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, respondent Court of Tax Appeals denied petitioner's claim
for refund because -</p>

<blockquote>"When NIA transferred the equipment in question supposedly ‘<u>after</u>
<u>its</u> (<span class="SpellE"><u>HYDRO</u><u><span style="">'s</span></u></span><span style="">)</span> <u>use</u>
<u><span style="">for</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>n</u></span><u>umber</u>
<u>of</u> <u>years’</u>, it cannot he doubted that these equipment were sold
and transferred presumably 'several years' after the equipments’ importation in
1978 and 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious therefore that
the sale or transfer of the ownership of the equipment to petitioner HYDRO were
unquestionably made after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of PD 882
on January 20, 1976, <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> said sale or
transfer thereof was (sic) governed by Section 4 of PD 882 and was correctly
applied by respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>take particular note of the fact
that we cannot pinpoint with definiteness or exactitude from the evidence, when
or what years after the years 1978 and 1979 importations were the equipment
sold or transferred by NIA to petitioner HYDRO so that we can determine
outright whether the sale or transfers are covered by the mandatory provision
of Executive Order 860 effective on December 21, 1982 imposing 3% additional <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">valorem</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>duty on such importations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such that if the sale or transfer of the
ownership of the equipment were <span class="GramE">effected</span> to petitioner
HYDRO <u>after</u> <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1982</st1:date>,
the effective date of Executive Order No. 860, the 3% <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> duty is imposable as said Executive Order
860 was applied prospectively and rightly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the sale or transfer of the ownership of the equipment to HYDRO were
(sic) <u>prior</u><span style=""> </span>to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Executive Order No. 860, then said Executive
Order 860 <span style="">is </span>inapplicable, and
petitioner is not liable to pay the 3% <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span>
duty of P281<span class="GramE">,591.00</span> and is entitled to the refund
thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a rule and principle, it was incumbent upon petitioner-taxpayer
HYDRO to have shown that the sale or transfer of said equipment to it were made
<u>before</u> December 21, 1982, when the Executive Order No. 860 was effective
in order that it shall not be subject to the imposition of 3% additional <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">valorem</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>duty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fairing thus, its claim for refund in the amount of P281<span class="GramE">,591.00</span> unquestionably fails." (pp. 37-38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 0.05in; text-indent: 0.25in;">The foregoing
conclusion is erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent
executions of the Deeds of Sale of the equipment in question on <st1:date month="12" day="6" year="1982">December 6, 1982</st1:date> and <st1:date month="3" day="24" year="1983">March 24, 1983</st1:date> are not relevant and
material <span style="">in </span>the consideration of
the application of Executive Order No. 860 because said Deeds of Sale were mere
formalities in the implementation of Contract No. MFI-C-1 executed on August
1978, which should be reckoned and construed as the actual date of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so because the contract of
purchase and sale of the NIA-financed/owned equipment to Hydro took place in
1978 when Contract No. <span style="">MP1-C-1 was
signed by NIA and HYDRO wherein the contracting parties provided for their
financing, procurement, delivery, repayment, transfer of possession and
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said scheme contemplated
a Contract of Sale within the purview of Art. 1458 of the Civil Code which
provides -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Art. </span>1458.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the contract of sale, one of the
contracting parties obligates himself to transfer the ownership of and to
deliver <span style="">a </span>determinate thing, and
the other to pay thereafter a price certain in money or its equivalent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A contract of sale may be absolute or conditional." (p.
11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This view is shared by the Collector of Customs in his decision
when he declared that there being a meeting of the minds between NIA and HYDRO
upon the object of the contract of sale and upon the price, the contract of
sale of the equipment between them was perfected in 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a perfected contract of sale subject to
a <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span> condition, the full payment by HYDRO of
the consideration for the subject of the contract is the operative act to
compel NIA to <span class="GramE">effect</span> the transfer of absolute
ownership thereof to HYDRO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And under Art.</span> 1187 of the Civil Code, the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said contract reverts back to the
constitution of the contract, in this case - August 1978.</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1187<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The</span> effects of a conditional obligation to give, once the
condition has been fulfilled, shall retroact to the day of the constitution of
the obligation." (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>a cardinal
rule that laws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary is provided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Art. 4, Civil Code) Except for a statement
providing for its immediate execution, Executive Order No. 860 does not provide
for its retroactivity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
Deputy Minister of Finance in his <u><span style="">1st</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
to the Central Bank dated <st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1983</st1:date>
which was reproduced by the Central Bank Governor in a circular letter to all
authorized agent <span class="GramE">banks,</span> clarified that letters of
credit opened prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of E.O. 860
are not subject to the provisions thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the importations in question which arrived in 1977 and
1978 are not subject to the <span class="SpellE">the</span> 3% additional <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> duty, the same being imposed only on
those whose letter of credit were opened after the promulgation of Executive
Order 860.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard Judge Alex
Reyes in his dissenting opinion correctly observed -</p>

<blockquote>"Let it suffice that the procurement of the equipment, as
earlier stated, was not on a tax exempt basis as the import liabilities thereon
have been secured to be p<span style="">aid </span>under
the terms of the financial scheme in the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The formality of vesting of title over the
equipment was not an unwarranted expectation but a matter of an implementation
of a pre-existing agreement, hence, the imported articles can only be subject to
the rates of import duties/taxes prevailing at the time of entry or withdrawal
from customs custody (Sec. 205, TCC) in 1978 and 1979, thus foreclosing any
retroactive application of the 1982 Executive Order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Taken in the above light, it would be unfair and incongruous
to hold petitioner to an additional levy <u>sans</u> any statutory basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority could have fumbled into a
precipitate action in taking an adverse position on petitioner's right to a
refund." (pp. 44-45, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS</b>, the petition is
