<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as found and summarized by the trial court

<blockquote>"It appears from the testimony of the offended party,
Christine Dorado, at 8 a girl of tender years and a Grade III pupil, that at
about 7 o'clock in the evening of June 3, 1987, while she was alone washing
some dishes on a cemented portion outside the kitchen of their house at the
PHHC Housing Project in <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Lawa</span>-an,
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City, the accused, whom she identified in court
as her assailant, surreptitiously approached her from behind, poked a knife at
her, threatened to kill her if she shouted, and then forced to lie down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she was already lying on the ground, the
accused held her by her hands, raised her skirt and forcibly removed her
underwear. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Then the accused forced his
sex organ into her genitals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This assault inflicted upon the complainant a fresh <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> laceration with slight bleeding at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5 o'clock</st1:time> position and a lacerated wound with
moderate bleeding at the vaginal mucosa, as shown in the medical certificate
issued by Dr. Evelyn B. <span class="SpellE">Sicad</span> who examined her at the
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Memorial General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the examining physician, there
was complete penetration as the hymen was almost completely broken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This finding of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the doctor was confirmed by the testimony of the </span>young <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">complainant herself who said that when the
accused forced his sexual organ into her genitals, there was complete
penetration, causing her vagina to bleed profusely and making her feel severe
pain that made her cry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the young
girl bled profusely as a result of the sexual assault committed against her
cannot be denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She identified in
court the pink dress she was then wearing which was full of bloodstains.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She likewise identified the underwear she had
on which the accused, according to her, forcibly removed, thereby tearing the
garter, in order to realize his carnal desires.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Before pointing in court to the accused as her assailant that
fateful early evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1987</st1:date>,
young Christine Dorado had twice clearly and positively identified the accused
as the man who criminally assaulted her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first time she did so was when immediately after the arrest of the
accused by the <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City Police he was taken to
their house and then and there, in the presence of the apprehending officers
and many other people, she identified and pointed to him as her assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did this again at the <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
City Police Station in the presence of her parents and police investigators
during the investigation of this case by the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the police station, following his
identification by the complainant, the accused admitted his guilt."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Appellant controverts the trial court's findings of fact and
submits the following recital:</p>

<blockquote>"[Accused Fernando Perez testified] that in the evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1987</st1:date>, he was at the house of
his girlfriend located at the upper portion of <span class="SpellE">Homesite</span>,

there by <span class="SpellE">Tawi</span> <span class="SpellE">Aga</span>-in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was apprehended at the house of his girlfriend,
<span class="SpellE">Mercidita</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then he was handcuffed and brought to the house of the victim for
identification, however, the victim could not recognize him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But after the victim had talked to the
police, victim pointed him as her assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was then brought to the police station where he was manhandled and
forced him to admit that he raped the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He fainted, then they splashed water on his face and after regaining
consciousness, he was made to stand and was hit by the butt of an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> on his forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was forced to admit the crime because he could not withstand the
maltreatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He has never been accused
of rape or acts of lasciviousness."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant principally contends that there is no evidence
sufficient to show that his identity <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was
</span>fully established by prosecution; that the identification made by the
victim of the appellant as her rapist was not made "spontaneously."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

inflicted upon him by the police authorities; that he was not assisted by
counsel when he made said admission; that such <span class="SpellE">maltreatement</span>
was even unqualifiedly attested to by the victim herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that the trial court gravely
erred when it appreciated and admitted said admission as evidence against the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing allegation need not detain us for long.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case against appellant herein was not
founded solely nor even principally on the said admission but rather on the positive
identification of the appellant by victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The basis of the trial court's finding of guilt was not the said
admission but the evidence adduced by the prosecution quite independently of
that admission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in its
decision, the court made only a passing reference to the admission appellant
now attacks.</p>
