<p class="BODY">In its decision, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">public

been filed beyond the five-year period prescribed by both the Rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of Court and the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also rejected the petitioner's claim that
she had not been reinstated on time and ruled as valid the two quitclaims she
had signed waiving her right to reinstatement and acknowledging settlement in
full of her back wages and other benefits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that this decision is tainted with grave
abuse of discretion and asks for its reversal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We shall affirm instead.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 6, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court, provides:</p>

<blockquote>In computing the time limited for suing out of an execution,
although there is authority to the contrary, the general rule is that there
should not be included the time when execution is stayed, either by agreement of
the parties for a definite time, by injunction, by the taking of an appeal or
writ of error so as to operate as a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>, by
the death of a party, or otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any
interruption or delay occasioned by the debtor will extend the time within

on their rights to have the judgment executed by mere motions, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The statute of limitations has not been devised against those who wish
to act but cannot do so, for causes beyond their control.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> insists it was the private
respondent that delayed and prevented the execution of the judgment in her
favor, but that is not the way we see it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The record shows it was she who dilly-dallied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original decision called for her reinstatement within ten
days from receipt thereof following its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> by
the NLRC on <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1980</st1:date>,
but there is no evidence that she demanded her reinstatement or that she complained
when her demand was rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What
appears is that she entered into a compromise agreement with CDCP where she
waived her right to reinstatement and received from the CDCP the sum of
P14,000.00 representing her back wages from the date of her dismissal to the
date of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">agreement.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Dismissing the compromise agreement, the petitioner now claims
she was actually reinstated only on March 16, 1987, and so should be granted
back pay for the period beginning November 28, 1978, date of her dismissal,
until the date of her reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
conveniently omits to mention several significant developments that transpired
during and after this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">period </span>that
seriously cast doubt on her candor and <u>bona</u> <u>fides</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">After accepting the sum of P14,000.00 from the private respondent
and waiving her right to reinstatement in the compromise agreement, the
petitioner secured employment as kitchen dispatcher at the Tito <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Restaurant, where she worked from October 1982 to March
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to the certification issued by that business,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

P1,904.00, which was higher than her salary in the CDCP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For reasons not disclosed by the record, she applied for
re-employment with the CDCP and was on <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="3">March
 16, 1987</st1:date>, given the position of <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
machine operator with a basic salary of P1,030.00 plus P461.33 in allowances,
for a total of P1,491.33 monthly.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1988</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1988</st1:date>,
the Corporate Legal Counsel of the private respondent (now Philippine National
Construction Corporation) recommended the payment to the petitioner of the sum
of P9,544.00, representing the balance of her back pay for three years at
P654.00 per month (minus the P14,000.00 earlier paid).<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1988</st1:date>,
the petitioner accepted this additional amount and signed another Quitclaim and
Release reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:</blockquote>

  87 Annapolis St.</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
  City</st1:city></st1:address>, hereby acknowledged receipt of the sum of
PESOS:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FORTY

balance of the back wages due me under the judgment award in NLRC Case No.
AB-2-864-79 entitled "Corazon <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> vs.
PNCC-TOLLWAYS" and I further manifest that this payment is in full satisfaction
of all my claims/demands in the aforesaid case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, I hereby manifest that I had voluntarily waived reinstatement
to my former position as TOLL TELLER and in lieu thereof, I sought and am
satisfied with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">my </span>present
position as XEROX MACHINE OPERATOR in the Central Office.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Finally, I hereby certify that delay in my reinstatement, after
finality of the Decision dated </u><st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="5"><u>10

the above-entitled case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I hereby state
further that I have no more claims or right of action of whatever nature,
whether past, present, future or contingent against said corporation and its
officers, relative to NLRC Case No. AB-2-864-79.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 10th day of

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was apparently satisfied with the settlement, for
in the memorandum she sent the PNCC Corporate Legal Counsel on <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1988</st1:date>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

she said in part:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sir, this is indeed my chance to express my <span class="SpellE">gratitute</span>

years of stay with PNCC by way of granting an additional amount of P9,544.00
among others x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>As per your recommendation contained therein in said memo, I am now
occupying the position of <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> machine operator and
is (sic) presently receiving a monthly salary of P2,014.00.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reacting to her inquiry about her entitlement to longevity pay,
yearly company increases and other statutory benefits, the private respondent
adjusted her monthly salary from P2,014.00 to P3,588.00 monthly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then the lull.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then the
bombshell.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1989</st1:date>,
she filed the motion for execution that is now the subject of this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is difficult to understand the attitude of the petitioner, who
has blown hot and cold, as if she does not know her own mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First she signed a waiver and then she
rejected it; then she signed another waiver which she also rejected, again on
the ground that she had been deceived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In her first waiver, she acknowledged full settlement of the judgment in
her favor, and then in the second waiver, after accepting additional payment,
she again acknowledged full settlement of the same judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But now she is singing a different tune.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her petition she is now disowning both acknowledgments and
claiming that the earlier payments, both of which she had accepted as
sufficient, are insufficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
valid before but they are not valid now.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She also claimed she was harassed and cheated by the past management of
the CDCP and sought the help of the new management of the PNCC under its
"dynamic leadership." But now she is denouncing the new management
for also tricking her into signing the second quitclaim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not all waivers and quitclaims are invalid as against public
policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the agreement was voluntarily
entered into and represents a reasonable settlement, it is binding on the
parties and may not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is only where there is clear proof that
the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person, or the terms of
settlement are unconscionable on its face, that the law will step in to annul
the questionable transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But where
it is shown that the person making the waiver did so voluntarily, with full
understanding of what he was doing, and the consideration for the quitclaim is
credible and reasonable, the transaction must be recognized as a valid and
binding undertaking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question may be asked:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why did the petitioner sign the compromise agreement of <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1980</st1:date>, and waive all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her </span>rights under the judgment in
consideration of the cash settlement she received?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that on that date the
decision could still have been elevated on <i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>before
this Court and there was still the possibility of its reversal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner obviously decided that a bird
in hand was worth two on the wing and so opted for the compromise
agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amount she was then
waiving, it is worth noting, had not yet come up to the exorbitant sum of
P205,207.42 that she was later to demand after the lapse of eight years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The back pay due the petitioner need not detain us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">We</span>
have held in countless cases that this should be limited to three years from
the date of the illegal dismissal, during which period (but not beyond) the
dismissed employee is deemed unemployed without the necessity of proof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the petitioner's contention that she should be paid from 1978 to 1987
must be rejected, and even without regard to the fact (that would otherwise
have been counted against her) that she was actually employed during most of
that period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the petitioner's invocation of Article 223 of the Labor
Code to question the failure of the private respondent to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond is not well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Solicitor General correctly points
out, the bond is required only when there is an appeal from the decision with a
monetary award, not an order enforcing the decision, as in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">As officers of the court, counsel are under obligation to advise
their clients against making untenable and inconsistent claims like the ones
raised in this petition that have only needlessly taken up the valuable time of
this Court, the Solicitor General, the Government Corporate Counsel, and the
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lawyers are not merely
hired employees who must unquestioningly do the bidding of the client, however
unreasonable this may be when tested by their own expert appreciation of the
pertinent facts and the applicable law and jurisprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Counsel must counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED, with costs against the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so </span>ordered.</p>
