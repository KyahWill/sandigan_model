prosecution witness Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tandinco</span>, Jr., the

prior to the arrival of the deceased and in the course of their drinking spree,
a heated discussion developed between the accused <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>

regarding the competition in the copra and transportation businesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His testimony on this point was not refuted

<blockquote>“It also appears that in the course of their drinking, there
developed a conversation and some sort of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

accused <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> and the late
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Milado</span> on the other hand also regarding their
copra business and competition in the ferry of passengers of their
motorboats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span> admitted this
‘slight altercation’ between himself and the deceased regarding the operation

the altercation started when he suggested to the deceased that it would be
better if they had alternate trips to <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>, one
day to the deceased, the next day for them and so on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposal was, however, not acceptable to
the deceased and who in fact flatly refused him with a loud voice and even
blamed him for engaging in a business in which the deceased was already
into.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span> further admitted that he then told the
deceased that the latter would not lose anything and there would be no more
competition and that since <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>deceased
was a government employee receiving <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>monthly salary, his businesses are just
sidelines to which remark the deceased even got madder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>, Jr. who was also in the drinking spree challenged
the deceased by saying ‘Doctor, what do you want?<span class="GramE">’.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deceased left immediately after this.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;font-family:a"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

further admitted that when the deceased had already left, he asked his brother
the accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>, Jr. why he had done what
he did and the accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>, Jr. replied by
saying, ‘I only threatened him because he has looked down on us’.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After saying this, the accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>, Jr. told him that he would be going home and as
his brother was leaving, he <span class="SpellE">adviced</span> him to be careful
as the deceased might return since he suddenly left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Again while no mention was made by the defense witnesses, no
refutation was also given to the testimony of prosecution witness Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tandinco</span>, Jr. to the effect that in the course of their
drinking spree, he saw the accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>,
Jr. box deceased Dr. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
while the latter was seated but the fist blow did not hit the deceased and
instead hit the shoulder of <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabian</span> because the deceased was covered by the said <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabian</span> and that after <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>while the said accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span> Jr. again delivered another fist blow at the

All these circumstances are present in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court noted that at the time the deceased <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">gave </span>his <u>ante</u>-<u>mortem</u>
statement, he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class="BODY">The rule does not specifically require that the decla­ration be
in writing or verbal, or that it should be in question-and-answer form.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In one case, this Court held that the
statement of the deceased given to his widow in one of his conscious moments
that the accused had inflicted the <span class="GramE">wounds</span> from which
he eventually died, is admissible in evidence as a dying declaration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

And then, even if the victim’s statement were not admissible as an <u>ante</u>-<u>mortem</u>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend next that the prosecution witnesses are

cousin of the widow, Mrs. Fe <span class="SpellE">Saavedra</span> <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, and was then an employee of the <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saavedra</span>

<span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Pantanosas</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> was, according to appellants, a close friend
of the deceased and used to supervise the unloading of passengers and cargoes
from the <span class="SpellE">pumpboats</span> of the deceased whenever the boats
arrived at the <span class="SpellE">Talalora</span> wharf.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, appel­lants allege that the
testimonies of these two (2) witnesses </span>and that of <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, a daughter of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, are full of glaring inconsistencies,

<p class="BODY">After <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

credibility of the prosecution witnesses is not affected by their relationship
with the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court has
consistently ruled that the mere fact that witnesses are relatives of the
victim is not proof sufficient to disregard their testimony nor does it render
the same less worthy of credit, as what is important is, they had positively
identified the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

Moreover, minor inconsistencies in the testimonies of witnesses are to be
expected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, discrepancies in the
testimonies of witnesses are indicative of credibility, for completely cong­ruent

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellants contend that the trial court erred in not
absolving them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argue that Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>, Jr. admitted that he alone stabbed Dr. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> in self-defense; that
<span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span> denied
participation and complicity in the commission of the crime charged; that <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Milado</span> put up the defense
of alibi which is corrobo­rated by the <u>ante</u>-<u>mortem</u> statement of
the deceased himself, as he made no mention therein of <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Milado</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of accused Tomas <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>,
Jr. that he alone stabbed the deceased in self-defense is negated by the
autopsy report of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The report states that several wounds were
inflicted on the deceased with the use of different objects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the finding of the trial court
that from the position and nature of the wounds, the same could not have been
inflicted by only one (1) person using one (1) weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And then, granting for the sake of argument
that accused <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>, Jr. stabbed the deceased in
self<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">-</span>defense, yet he himself
admitted that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> was already “sick” after he
kn<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">oc</span>ked down the latter with a
second blow.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He (<span class="SpellE">Bocatcat</span>,
Jr.) was, moreover, able to deflect the hand of the victim, which was holding
the gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the weakened
condition of the deceased, there was no longer a rational necessity to stab him
several times even in self-defense<span style="font-family:a">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The number and nature of the stab wounds on the body of the
victim prove that more than one (1) person inflicted the wounds and belie <span class="SpellE">Bocatcat’s</span> theory of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show that the appellants stabbed
the victim, while his two (2) hands were held back and when he was already
lying down on the street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the
assailants acted in concert and with community of criminal purpose to ensure
the death of the victim is indicative of conspiracy between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conspiracy is established by concerted

cannot be overcome by his mere denial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
