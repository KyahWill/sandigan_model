5, 1977, September 17, 1977 and March 14, 1978 of the Bureau of Labor Relations
for having been issued in excess of juris­diction and with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It, likewise, prays for an
order directing respondent director to hold a certification election so that
the employees in the company can elect a union representative to negotiate an
improved collective bargaining agreement to replace the agreement which has
expired on <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1976</st1:date>,
Plum Federation of Industrial and Agrarian Workers filed a petition, praying
that it be certified as the sole and exclusive bargaining agent of the
rank-and-file workers of Manila Jockey Club, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1976</st1:date>,
the Manila Jockey Club Race Day Operation Employees Labor Union-PTGWO filed a
motion to intervene and oppo­sition to said petition and alleged among other
things, that it is the recognized collective bargaining representative of all
the employees of the company and that it is in the process of negotiating a
modification of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 30, 1976, another supplemental motion to dismiss was
filed by <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> PTGWO, this time invoking the
"No Union Raiding Clause" of the "Code of Ethics" adopted
by the members of the Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (T.U.C.P.)
wherein both petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> are members,
and claiming that the petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">failed
to satisfy the 30% requirement of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The entire record of the case was forwarded to the Office of the
President of the T.U.C.P. for the purpose of submitting the matter to the
Congress for decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On March 16, 1977, the
entire record of the case was returned by the T.U.C.P. President to the Office
of then Secretary of Labor which in turn transmitted the same to the Bureau of
Labor Relations Office with a forwarding letter signed by the late Roberto S. <span class="SpellE">Oca</span> in his capacity as President of the Congress, stating
among other things, the following:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

approved that the above-captioned case be referred back to the BLR and that
MJCR-OELU-PTGWO be declared as the sole and ex­clusive bargaining agent, thus
dismissing the petition of <st1:place>PLUM</st1:place>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner PLUM filed an

thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"While it may be true that the facts of the case may warrant
the holding of a certification election in the bargaining unit concerned, to
sustain first the decision arrived at by the National Executive Board of TUCP
appears of indispensable importance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contenders in the case at bar are both members of TUCP.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Undeniably, there are internal rules
including their Code of Ethics to keep them intact, to govern their actions and
finally to preserve the Congress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
therefore, a matter of utmost necessity that a decision arrived at by the
National Executive Board be respected and enforced not only by the members of
the Congress themselves but also by this Bureau and the Department if necessity
arises.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appealed order has the letter of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Oca</span> as its basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is worthy to note that the latter sent said communication in his capacity as
President of the TUCP and nothing else.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whether or not he happens also to be the president of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> union is of no legal signi­ficance since the
decision of the TUCP was handed down by its National Executive Board and not by
him alone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Other recourse could have been taken by appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Very much aware of the Decision of the
National Executive Board on <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="3">March 7,
 1977</st1:date>, it could have asked for a reconsideration of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As shown by the records, the first decision
of the National Board was for the holding of a certification election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
asked for a reconsideration hence the March 7, decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's failure however could <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span> be interpreted as satisfaction of the
Decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this Office now, to
sustain appellant's stand and re-open the case again by giving due course to
the instant appeal is not only an open manifestation of non-recognition of the
existence of TUCP but a further obstruction to the goal of the Department to
establish one-union in one industry; thus at the end, to attain industrial
peace."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was also denied by public
respondent for being <u>pro</u>-<u>forma</u>, hence the present recourse by way
of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was asserted by petitioner that nowhere in the Labor Code or
in the new Constitution has TUCP been granted any authority to supersede or
impair the holding of a certification election or deny the majority employees
of their right to elect their own union; that public respondent and the PTGWO
acted without jurisdiction in defiance of the rule of law and popular
democracy; that it is not within the Code of Ethics to suppress the employees'
freedom to choose their own union; and that the TUCP, while asserting itself to
be a Labor Center did not call the parties involved for conference, to submit
evidence or to make a fair judicious and rational evaluation of the dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General in his manifestation and motion prayed that
he be relieved from filing the required answer to the instant petition for the
reason that he was unable to sustain respondent bureau director's questioned
orders and resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records of
the case were returned to said public respondent and he was granted an
extension of time within which to submit his own answer to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> in his comment (answer)
made it clear that he is not opposed to the conduct of a certification
election, and in fact he is ready to hold such election if the case is returned
to the juris­diction of his office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, he stressed that the TUCP Code of Ethics and General Council
Resolution No. 76-2 are clear expressions of consent by the signatory members,
including their locals or affiliates, to settle their disputes among themselves
in accordance with the decision of the National Executive Board and the
decision he made was made pursuant to such an agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent union maintained its stand
that no certification election should be held because the petition was not
supported by the written consent of at least 30% of all the employees in the
bargaining unit, and that this requirement is mandatory.</p>

<p class="BODY">A letter from the president of respondent union reveals the
present state of affairs of the employees wherein they are deprived of the
benefits of a collective bargaining agreement, for management refused to
bargain with the union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If this
situation continues, the employees would stand to lose and with the present
set-up, a certification election is warranted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Time and again, We have ruled in a long-line of cases that the workers'
welfare can be promoted through the bargaining process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certification election is the fairest and
most effective way of determining which labor organization can truly represent
the working force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a fundamental
postulate that the will of the majority if given expression in an honest
election with freedom on the part of the voters to make their choice, is
controlling.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Protection to labor and freedom of peaceful assembly and association are
guaranteed by the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the issue of whether or not the 30% minimum subscription
requirement was met, it was held that the Director is still empowered to call
for a certification election provided there was no abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in the case at bar, instead of
ordering an election, respondent Director dismissed the appeal of PLUM based on
the decision of the TUCP, which the Court considers an impairment of the
freedom of the workers to voice out their choice of the union to represent
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there is any doubt as to the
required number having met, there would be no better way than the holding of a
certification election to ascertain which union really commands the allegiance
of the rank-and-file employ­ees.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
If the desired goal is for the execution of a collective bargaining contract to
protect the workers, then certification election is the most appropriate means
to attain said end.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since there has been no certification election for the past three
(3) years as well as a certified collective bargaining agreement which should
govern the economic and working conditions of the workers, a certification
election should immediately be ordered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court had repeatedly made it clear that in labor controversies,
time is of the essence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>
